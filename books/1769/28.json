Ugh. Just ugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to keep an emotional distance between them for when the inevitable break came, and yet somehow still allow herself to touch and taste him and experience the heaven that was his body. Might be difficult. The man definitely knew how to steal female hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rasped his knuckles against the metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand why we have to knock,\" she grumbled. \"It\u0027s my apartment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, it\u0027s ours. I get fifty percent of your assets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch my books, and I\u0027ll cut off your hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha! You need my hands more than I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark-haired, dark-skinned man opened the door, saving her from replying. She\u0027d seen the gorgeous agent before, knew who he was, but had never spoken to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed her a bright, white smile as he leaned against the frame. His ice-blue eyes glowed merrily. \"Don\u0027t think we\u0027ve met officially. I\u0027m Dallas, the big guy\u0027s best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bride ...\" What was Devyn\u0027s last name? Bride suddenly wondered. Did he even have one? And would he want her to use it? Stop. You aren\u0027t really married to him. \"McKells. Bride McKells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Bride,\" Devyn said with a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallas\u0027s grin widened. \"Come in, come in. Macy\u0027s waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy was here? Bride pushed past the agent without another word and sailed inside. It was her place, anyway, and she could do what she wanted. Sure enough, Macy was inside the kitchen, fixing dinner. Sandwiches. Someone must have gone shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her friend spotted her, she stopped what she was doing and rushed forward, features dark with concern. \"Thank God. I\u0027ve been so worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride hugged her tight. \"I\u0027m fine, I promise. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.\" Macy pulled back and studied her. \"I hear you\u0027re married. Is that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said with a determined shake of her head. \"We\u0027re still hammering out the details,\" Devyn said from behind her. She almost stomped her foot. \"There aren\u0027t any details to hammer out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So anyway, it\u0027s our lucky day,\" she heard Dallas tell Devyn, who subsequently ignored her. \"Nolan finally gave up his queen\u0027s landing point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Macy shared a look of understanding, then quieted, listening to the men while pretending they were cleaning the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but do we trust him?\" Devyn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rustle of clothing. Dallas must have shrugged. \"Mia\u0027s got a crew staking out the place now, ready to stun her. Nolan was stunnable that first time, too, remember? Anyway, you didn\u0027t let me finish. I went ahead and interrogated the human slavers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride spun around, no longer content to pretend not to listen. The human slavers. She\u0027d forgotten about them. \"What did they say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy moved to her side and gripped her hand. One of them was trembling, but she couldn\u0027t tell which. Perhaps they both were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn jabbed a finger into Dallas\u0027s wide chest, again ignoring her. \"I told you I would handle them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar from intimidated, Dallas grinned. \"And Mia told everyone in the building to keep you out of their cells. She didn\u0027t want their heads on the evening news. Anyway, I interrogated them in a manner you would have approved of and got the date and time of their next auction. A week from tomorrow. Bride\u0027s potential buyer is going to be there, because two other vampires have been caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther vampires had been caught? They were to be sold? Enslaved? Bile rose in her throat. Macy\u0027s arm wound around her, offering comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know something else. Tell me,\" Devyn commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallas paused, his expression hardening. \"Here\u0027s the thing. Remember the vision I had?\" A clipped nod from Devyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moment I heard about the auction, something dark clicked inside me, and I knew, knew. If you go, you\u0027ll start a chain of unstoppable events that will not end well for you.\" Another pause, mouth grim. \"Maybe they\u0027ll even lead to the pier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride wondered about Dallas\u0027s comment while soaking in Devyn\u0027s tub later that evening. What chain of events? What was supposed to happen at the pier? She\u0027d asked Devyn, but he\u0027d distracted her with sex, the slut, and she\u0027d gotten no answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dallas had spoken in that grim tone, his baby blues solemn, she\u0027d experienced an overpowering flood of dread. Both men were certain something bad was going to happen to Devyn at the pier. She was sure of it. But what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, she gave up trying to figure it out on her own. Her brain seemed to be on hiatus, anyway, steam wafting around her, soft music playing in the background. A girl could get used to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn strode into the bathroom, spotted her, and grinned slowly, wickedly. \"What do we have here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubbles fluffed the surface, hiding the sudden hardening of her nipples. \"Get that look off your face. We are not going for round four.\" Or would it be round five? \"I\u0027m relaxing.\" And God, it was divine. The water was warm, soothing, lapping fantastically at her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than leave, he perched at the edge of the porcelain. \"I should join you. It\u0027s still our honeymoon, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not married, but I am going to enjoy this while I can.\" She sank deeper into the liquid paradise. Her hair was anchored in a knot on top of her head, so she didn\u0027t have to worry about soaking it. \"Actually, I just changed my mind. We are married. I\u0027ll take this house, and therefore this tub, in the divorce settlement. What are you worth, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dipped in his hand and flicked several drops on her face. \"A lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent,\" she said with a grin. \"Half of a lot will be very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diabolical woman,\" he muttered. \"Thinking of leaving me already when I came bearing a gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A gift?\" She straightened, clapped excitedly. \"For me? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, for my other pseudo-wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me see, let me see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, he reached into his pocket and withdrew a small black box. It couldn\u0027t be, she thought. Surely wasn\u0027t ... he flipped the lid, and her eyes widened in shock. Not a ring—she was not disappointed—but a ... she leaned closer. A necklace charm, she realized. An emerald, like the one she\u0027d given Macy. Only bigger. And shinier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed you returned hers,\" he said, no longer sounding as confident as he had before. \"If you don\u0027t like it, I can—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it. Give me!\" She snatched the box before he could put it away and clutched it to her chest. It was the sweetest, most thoughtful present she\u0027d ever received. Her chest was aching, and it had nothing to do with the thorns or the fire. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze met hers, a gleam she couldn\u0027t read in his eyes. He coughed, clearing his throat as if he were uncomfortable. \"You\u0027re, uh, welcome. I\u0027ll get you a chain for it. I just didn\u0027t have one handy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for that in advance.\" She bit her bottom lip. \"I don\u0027t have anything for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" he said, flicking a little more water on her face. Those amber eyes were practically sparkling with sensual intent now, whatever else had been resting there gone as if it had never been. \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll think of some way for you to repay my amazing generosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body instantly reacted, her stomach quivering, her blood heating. She was beginning to love his inflated ego and insatiable appetite. \"Ah, yes. That wouldn\u0027t happen to involve my wifely duty in your bed, would it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t whisk her from the tub and carry her to said bed or even slip into the tub with her, as she\u0027d halfway expected. Rather, he tilted his head, his lips dipping into a frown. The desire in those magnificent amber eyes even died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed to his feet. \"I have some things to do.\" His voice was flat, faraway. \"You\u0027ll be fine on your own.\" O-kay. What had she said? \"Sure you can\u0027t join me?\" she found herself asking. She might have told him there\u0027d be no sex while she was relaxing, but she hadn\u0027t meant it. Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\" He left her without another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWifely duty, she\u0027d said. Wifely duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant, Devyn had a husbandly duty. According to his father, that duty involved respecting her body, mind, and soul. You don\u0027t follow your father\u0027s rules anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, she was his wife, and he did want to do right by her. That had become clear when she had not used his last name while introducing herself to Dallas, as was custom for humans. Her cheeks had even darkened with color. She hadn\u0027t known how to introduce herself, hadn\u0027t known her place in his life, and had most likely been embarrassed by that. That embarrassment had shamed him, even though he didn\u0027t know her place in his life. He\u0027d thought, She is my responsibility right now, and I have failed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want that proud woman embarrassed in front of anyone. Even himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what to do with her. Didn\u0027t know what he felt about—or for—her. All he knew was that he didn\u0027t want her thinking she meant nothing. Every moment he spent in her presence, he liked her more. When they\u0027d returned from her apartment, he\u0027d spent an hour thinking of ways to make her smile and laugh. That\u0027s when he recalled the emerald charm he\u0027d purchased after meeting her. He hadn\u0027t realized at the time, but he\u0027d bought it because it had reminded him of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d given it to her and gotten the reaction he\u0027d craved. He\u0027d thought to spend a few hours basking in that reaction. In bed, of course, naked and straining for release. Then ... Wifely duty. Husbandly duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she no longer showed any signs of it, her previous insecurity still haunted him. He had caused it, He had destroyed her delightful self-confidence. Before, he\u0027d even made her cry—and he\u0027d wanted to die! Had he not been so angry, he might have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d decided to ignore his guilt and shame all those years ago, he must have muted all his other emotions. No wonder female tears hadn\u0027t bothered him. No wonder he could kill so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Bride was in his life, now that he had another wife, the guilt was returning, so his other emotions must be making themselves known, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn this. He had to give Bride something to prove he wasn\u0027t the barbarian she assumed. It was his husbandly duty. And he knew of only one way to show her that he did respect her, he did value her, and he would care for her properly while they were together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn stripped and jumped into the pool in his backyard. He swam lap after lap, not stopping until he was panting, sweating even though the water was cold. To respect a female, a male did not press his baser urges on her. He did not press his baser urges on anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you, Macy, after that bubble bath, everything changed between us, and by the end of the week, what I knew would happen, happened,\" Bride said into the phone. Devyn was gone, again, doing God knew what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" her friend asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devyn\u0027s grown tired of me.\" She tried to keep the pout from her voice. They hadn\u0027t slept in the same bed. Not once. She slept in his room, and he crashed in the bedroom next door. \"He feeds me once a day, but that\u0027s it. That\u0027s the only time he touches me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d tiptoed inside his chosen chamber that first night, meaning to slide in beside him and have a little fun. He\u0027d been hard as a rock, yet he\u0027d picked her up and carried her back. And he hadn\u0027t stayed with her! He\u0027d immediately stomped back to the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Bride. I\u0027m sorry. Is he seeing someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. I mean, he\u0027s churlish, like he\u0027s not getting any at all. Even from himself, if you know what I mean.\" She flung herself on the mattress, the beads on her harem costume clinking together. She, Devyn, and Dallas were due to attend the slave auction in just a few hours, something she was both nervous and excited about. Finally, she would meet another vampire. \"Plus, he\u0027s not the kind to cheat. Yeah, he\u0027s a slut, but he\u0027s also brutally honest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve offered to leave. Several times. He just hands me wads of cash and tells me to buy something pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" her friend asked with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I horde it, of course. But that\u0027s not all he\u0027s done. He even bought me a bowl of apples and cherries because I mentioned I liked their smell. I don\u0027t understand him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he doesn\u0027t understand himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. \"Let\u0027s just ... I don\u0027t know, let\u0027s talk about something else. My blood pressure is rising.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, the thorns and fire were no longer content in the shadows. They\u0027d reappeared a few days ago, probably because she\u0027d never been so frustrated in her life, and hadn\u0027t let up since. Even now she had to rub her breastbone to ease the ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nolan is still doing well,\" Macy said. \"Hasn\u0027t relapsed at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he been declared healed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. AIR had to kill the last doctors who tested him, so no one\u0027s willing to volunteer to take his blood this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understandable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, a door closed. Every muscle in her body stiffened. \"I\u0027ve got to go,\" she said. \"Devyn\u0027s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy\u0027s sigh crackled over the line. \"You know that I love you, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. How could you not? I\u0027m amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you sound like him,\" her friend said with a laugh. \"You know that you\u0027ll always be in my life, right? No matter what happens to the two of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride fingered the emerald even now dangling at her throat. \"Just as you\u0027ll be in mine. I love you, Leah Leah.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-28.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
