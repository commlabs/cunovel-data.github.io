They were in a park, seated on a bench, and Janice gestured for her to keep her voice down. When Demora had gotten out of school that day, Janice had been waiting for her. She\u0027d met Janice a couple of times in the past, had brief and pleasant chats with her. None of those casual social interactions, however, had remotely prepared Demora for anything like this.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora was fifteen years old. The growth spurt had kicked in a couple of years earlier, as her father had long predicted. She was a half a foot taller, and her body no longer could be mistaken for preadolescent, even if she\u0027d been clothed in a potato sack. Her face had also lost the babyish look, and now had the sculpted features of a striking young woman. Now, though, Janice was worried that the teen was on the verge of an apoplectic seizure that would preclude her ever seeing sixteen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He stole the Enterprise?\" Demora said again. This time she managed to keep her voice to an appalled whisper. \"What do you mean, stole. You can\u0027t just steal a starship. It\u0027s …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clearly she was having trouble fully grasping the notion. It was hardly surprising, considering the hellacious past couple of months they\u0027d had. She\u0027d heard chapter and verse about the routine training mission that had turned into a duel to the death with a twentieth-century madman named Khan. She\u0027d remembered the blood draining from her face as Chekov had described (over Sulu\u0027s protestations) their nail-biting escape from the Genesis torpedo … an escape made only at the cost of Mr. Spock\u0027s life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maybe it had all been too much for him. Her father was out of practice for such life-and-death struggles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We can say it was stress,\" Demora said quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rand stared at her, confused. \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Stress. You know. After that training mission, and Spock\u0027s death … then he found out that they were planning to decommission the Enterprise, and he just … snapped. Temporary insanity.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Janice was shaking her head. \"Demora, it wasn\u0027t like that. It wasn\u0027t just some impulse thing. It was carefully planned.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean he planned out a whole—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It wasn\u0027t just him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It wasn\u0027t.\" Demora paused a moment, her face clouding. \"Let me guess: the usual suspects.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rand nodded. \"It had something to do with Spock … and with Dr. McCoy. I\u0027m still a little hazy on the details. . . .\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh my God,\" said Demora, her face in her hands. \"But … but how? You can\u0027t just waltz into spacedock and leave with a starship. Shouldn\u0027t someone have tried to stop them?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Someone did try. Captain Styles of the Excelsior. But the Enterprise got away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Got away? From the Excelsior? How did …?\" Her face went ashen. \"They … they didn\u0027t fire on it, did they? Didn\u0027t get into a fight …?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no. Nothing like that. They just …\" Rand cleared her throat. \"They broke it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora stared at her, not sure she\u0027d heard right. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They broke it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you break a starship?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Janice waved her hands in exasperation. \"They shot the hamster running on the little treadmill that makes it go. I don\u0027t know what they did! They broke it. The Excelsior went about ten meters and then the engines conked out. Captain Styles isn\u0027t real happy about it. Made him look like a fool. They\u0027re already calling him Styles Without Substance. No, not happy at all, that one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Birds overhead, recognizing Demora as a customary easy touch for food, settled down near her. \"Scram!\" she shouted and shooed them away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Okay,\" she said after a moment, \"okay … maybe this won\u0027t be so bad. No property\u0027s been really damaged. No one\u0027s been killed. Maybe this is salvageable. If … if Dad and the others just … just bring the Enterprise back … considering their record, maybe this can all go away. They just need a real good lawyer. Maybe that Cogley guy …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she saw that Janice was shaking her head. \"No Cogley?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not the problem. The problem is bringing back the Enterprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora\u0027s voice was deathly cold. \"What … happened to the Enterprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They broke it,\" said Rand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean broke it like shooting the hamster?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I mean broke it like into a million pieces. Admiral Kirk blew it up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora, feeling ill, put her head between her legs. \"Why did he blow it up?\" she asked, her voice so faint that Janice could barely hear it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sure he had a reason.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course he had a reason. The reason was to drive me insane!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clearly she was making no attempt to keep her voice down anymore. Passersby in the park glanced her way briefly and then hurried on about their business.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where\u0027s Dad now? Is he okay? He …\" Suddenly she was struck by the horrible thought that maybe this was a long, labored way of breaking the news to her gently. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s fine,\" Janice said quickly, patting her on the hand. \"I swear, he\u0027s fine. He\u0027s on Vulcan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Vulcan? What\u0027s he doing on Vulcan?\" \"I\u0027m a little confused on that part myself. Believe it or not … I think he\u0027s there with Spock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"With Spock? Spock\u0027s dead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He …\" Janice fished for words and couldn\u0027t find any good ones. \"… he got better,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora stood. \"I\u0027m going home now,\" she announced. \"I\u0027m going home … I\u0027m going to crawl under the blankets … and when I wake up, I\u0027ll find out this was all an insane dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Close. You\u0027ll go home and pack your stuff, and then you\u0027re coming to my place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your place? Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because the message your father managed to get out to me said that\u0027s what he wanted. Demora … you have to understand. Sulu, the admiral, all of them … they\u0027re criminals now. Wanted fugitives. They\u0027re under protection by the Vulcan Council, but they can\u0027t budge from the planet without risking immediate arrest.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora couldn\u0027t believe it. She felt as if her world had tilted at a forty-five-degree angle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not the kind of circumstance that allows a genuine freeflow of communication, you know? Sulu was able to get a brief message out to me, slipping it through Communicore. But that\u0027s the best he could do, and it\u0027s not likely we\u0027ll be hearing from him again until this whole business is settled.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which will be … when?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Janice Rand, not recalling a time in her life when she\u0027d felt quite this helpless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All … all right. All right, Janice. I\u0027ll get my stuff … I\u0027ll lock up the apartment … and I\u0027ll room with you. If that\u0027s okay.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s fine,\" said Janice. \"Really.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora stood, shaking her head. \"I don\u0027t understand why … or how … he could have done this to me. I just don\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Actually … he asked me to relay something to you. Something he said he hoped would help you understand. He said to tell you that it was a matter of honor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora sighed. \"Yes. I had a feeling that\u0027s what he\u0027d say.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28436.html","bookId":44,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:22 AM"}
