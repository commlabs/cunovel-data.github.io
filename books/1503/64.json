What advantage would that bring me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se said coldly: “If you can defeat me, how about I give you my position of Company Leader?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s eyeballs swirled around and he said: “And what if I lose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se said bitterly: “Then you get lost from our military camp, or at least from our 3rd Battalion.” She knew that she definitely could not beat Shangguan Bing’er in individual strength as she was a Heavenly Jewel Master, but she definitely believed she was much stronger than her in military command. However, this Little Fatty Zhou had suddenly appeared and actually completely disrupted her plan to upset Shangguan Bing’er. That also meant that it would be even more difficult for her to snatch the position of Battalion Commander, furthermore, her most important goal was to prove she excelled as much as Shangguan Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope, what’s so good about being a Company Leader? How can it compare to following the beautiful Battalion Commander, that’s so comfortable.” Zhou Weiqing shook his head once again repeatedly, a serious expression on his face. Of course, within his heart he was already laughing, thinking to himself: \u003cem\u003eXiao Se, Xiao Ruse, heh heh.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you?\u0026nbsp; Do you think of nothing but romantic relationships in your head? What do you want then?” Anger flashed in Xiao Se’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shrugged and said: “How about this, if I lose, as you said I will leave the Battalion Commander, and leave our 3rd Battalion. However, if you lose, you must accept one condition from me. However, I haven’t thought of what this condition will be yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se’s brow furrowed as she looked sharply at Zhou Weiqing, however this Little Fatty Zhou had a pure and good-hearted looking face with a simple and honest appearance, and just notice anything from just looking at him, that was really too difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It can only be something that I can do, and it cannot involve my family, or do something against my conscience.” After some thought, Xiao Se agreed in a solemn voice. She really needed to make this Little Fatty Zhou leave Shangguan Bing’er, otherwise with such a recruit with such high potential on her side in the army, how could she compete with her? Furthermore, she had trained hard on her archery all these years, although Little Fatty Zhou had displayed some impressive archery earlier, but she was still confident in beating him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Zhou Weiqing complied happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me.” Xiao Se turned around and walked off, heading towards the Stars Forest near the Heavenly Bow City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing took a quick look Shangguan Bing’er who was watching the remaining tournament. Seeing that she was not paying attention to him, he quickly slid away quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se walked to the edge of the Stars Forest before stopping to wait for Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing arrived at her side and asked: “How do you want to fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se said solemnly: “1v1, you and I. The forest is the place which can best display an archer’s strength. We will enter the forest at the same time, get a distance of 300 yards between us, and when I say start, we shall both attack each other. Whoever hits the enemy first will win, how does that sound?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said cautiously: “Company Leader Xiao, you aren’t trying to shoot me with a real arrow right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se said angrily: “Bullshit, you are a soldier of our Empire, why would I want to kill you? Although your father I do not like you, but you are not worth me killing you. We’ll be using the training arrows.” As she said that, she took off a quiver of arrows and threw it to Zhou Weiqing, while she took out another quiver of her own, with both quivers holding 50 arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stretched himself and said: “Please go ahead, Company Leader Xiao.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Se gave a cold humph, and quickly entered the Stars Forest. Zhou Weiqing could clearly see a Purple Dawn Bow on her back as well. With her family’s influence in the Heavenly Bow City, it was really easy to get hold of another Purple Dawn Bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing Xiao Se entering the Stars Forest, Zhou Weiqing also made his move and entered. In his heart he mused: Ruse Sis, let me see how your skill now after the seven years that we haven’t met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery soon they had both entered deep into the forest, and after a while, Xiao Se’s sound resounded from the distance: “Little Fatty Zhou, are you ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, let’s do this.” Zhou Weiqing shouted back in agreement. As he said that, he quickly moved from his previous position, vaulting up into a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start!” Xiao Se shouted out coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as they were starting their fight in the Stars Forest, at the other side, Shangguan Bing’er had also discovered Zhou Weiqing’s disappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is Little Fatty Zhou?” Shangguan Bing’er looked somewhat anxiously around for Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Company Leaders said in a low voice: “Battalion Commander, I saw him and Company Leader Xiao walking off just a while back, they are both from your Battalion, there shouldn’t be any issue right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er’s expression changed slightly, but quickly returned to normal again and she said passively: “Alright, no worries, it’ll be good to teach him a lesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Company Leader grinned and didn’t say anything else. Alas, how would he know that the “him” that Shangguan Bing’er was referring to was not Zhou Weiqing, but Xiao Se.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Stars Forest, Zhou Weiqing was waiting quietly deep in a large tree full of leaves and branches, with the Purple Dawn Bow in his grasp. He was like a cheetah awaiting its prey, and in his body, his Heavenly Energy was revolving quietly, and his Heavenly Jewels appearing around his wrist. The six color wheel disk was present in his sight, and his senses were all significantly improved, every slight sound and movement from the surroundings being processed by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty Zhou, are you afraid?” At this time, Xiao Se’s sound sounded out suddenly, obviously much closer than before. His sound was somewhat drifting, and it was obvious that she was moving at high-speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing naturally was not silly enough to reply, as he continued his silent ambush in the tree. The attribute wheel disk in his eyes revolved to the black region representing the Darkness Attribute, and immediately a dark and gloomy aura proliferated his entire body. 12 black shadows silently moved forth from his body, spreading out from the tree and gliding off all around into the shadows. If one looked carefully, he would discover that those black shadows looked very much like vines as thick as a human’s arm, but they did not have any actual substance, and they passed by silently and without any disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Zhou Weiqing’s first Skill Stored in his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewel from one of the Zong stage Darkness Heavenly Beast, and the skill name was called the ‘Touch of Darkness’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Skill-Storing Palace, Zhou Weiqing’s Skill-Storing attempts had actually all succeeded. However, it was unlike during the Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment which had depended on his Darkness and Evil attributes superimposing to succeed. When Zhou Weiqing had first entered the Skill-Storing Palace and saw the sealed Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, he was actually unbearable frightened. Most of the Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts were extremely huge, and all of them gave forth a terrifying aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zhou Weiqing attempted a Skill-Storing on a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast, a different phenomenon occurred. The reason why Skill-Storing on the Elemental Jewel usually failed easily was because even if the Heavenly Beast was at its weakest and sealed up, it would still subconsciously resist with all its might. This would affect the Elemental or Heavenly Jewel Masters who were trying to absorb their Skills into their own Elemental Jewels. However, when Zhou Weiqing carried out the Skill- Storing on the Zong Stage Heavenly Beast, according to the normal process, a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast’s internal energy\u0026nbsp; resisting would easily shake him away to fly off. However, the reality was that the sealed Heavenly Beasts actually did not resist at all and instead coordinated with him to allow him to Store Skills. As he had continued to do so with several Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, Zhou Weiqing even felt that those Heavenly Beasts actually seemed to be shivering, seemingly afraid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-3-chapter-16-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-3-chapter-17-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-3-chapter-16-04","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
