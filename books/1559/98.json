He carried Inigo inside, placed him upstairs on Falkbridge’s feather bed, then hurried away to the entrance of the Thieves Quarter, dragging the wagon behind him. He made very sure that the dirty blanket covered both the victims, and outside the entrance the Brute Squad held a boot count of those they had removed. The total came out right, and, by eleven in the morning, the great walled Thieves Quarter was officially empty and padlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleased from active duty, Fezzik followed the wall around to a quiet place and waited. He was alone. Walls were never any problem for him, not so long as his arms worked, and he quickly scaled this one and hurried back through the quiet streets to Falkbridge’s house. He made some tea, carried it upstairs, force-fed Inigo. Within a few moments, Inigo was blinking under his own power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just so good to see you,” Fezzik said then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. it is, it is,” Inigo agreed, “and I’m sorry for fainting, but I have done nothing for ninety days but wait for Vizzini and drink brandy, and a surprise like seeing you, well, that was just too much for me on an empty stomach. But I’m fine now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Fezzik said. “Vizzini is dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is, eh? Dead, you say… Vizz…” and then he fainted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFezzik began berating himself. “Oh, you stupid, if there’s a right way and a wrong way, trust you to find the dumb way; fool, fool, back to the beginning was the rule.” Fezzik really felt idiotic then because, after months of forgetting, now that he didn’t need to remember any more, he remembered. He hurried downstairs and made some tea and brought some crackers and honey and fed Inigo again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Inigo blinked, Fezzik said, “Rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, my friend; no more fainting.” And he closed his eyes and slept for an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFezzik busied himself in Falkbridge’s kitchen. He really didn’t know how to prepare a proper meal, but he could heat and he could cool and he could sniff the good meat from the rotted, so it wasn’t too great a task to finally end up with something that once looked like roast beef and another thing that could have been a potato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unexpected smell of hot food brought Inigo around, and he lay in bed, eating every bite Fezzik fed him. “I never realized I was in such terrible condition,” Inigo said, chewing away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-98.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
