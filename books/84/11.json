When Du Roy returned an hour later, no one called him by that name. From the office he proceeded to his home, and hearing the sound of ladies’ voices in the drawing-room, he asked the servant: “Who is here?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Mme. Walter and Mme. de Marelle,” was the reply.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis heart pulsated violently as he opened the door. Clotilde was seated by the fireplace; it seemed to Georges that she turned pale on perceiving him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaving greeted Mme. Walter and her two daughters seated like sentinels beside her, he turned to his former mistress. She extended her hand; he took and pressed it as if to say: “I love you still!” She returned the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe said: “Have you been well since we last met?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes; have you, Bel-Ami?” And turning to Madeleine she added: “Will you permit me to call him Bel-Ami?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Certainly, my dear; I will permit anything you wish.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA shade of irony lurked beneath those words, uttered so pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMme. Walter mentioned a fencing-match to be given at Jacques Rival’s apartments, the proceeds to be devoted to charities, and in which many society ladies were going to assist. She said: “It will be very entertaining; but I am in despair, for we have no one to escort us, my husband having an engagement.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy offered his services at once. She accepted, saying: “My daughters and I shall be very grateful.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the younger of the two girls and thought: “Little Suzanne is not at all bad, not at all.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe resembled a doll, being very small and dainty, with a well- proportioned form, a pretty, delicate face, blue-gray eyes, a fair skin, and curly, flaxen hair. Her elder sister, Rose, was plain — one of those girls to whom no attention is ever paid. Her mother rose, and turning to Georges, said: “I shall count on you next Thursday at two o’clock.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe replied: “Count upon me, Madame.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door closed upon Mme. Walter, Mme. de Marelle, in her turn, rose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Au revoir, Bel-Ami.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis time she pressed his hand and he was moved by that silent avowal. “I will go to see her to-morrow,” thought he.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLeft alone with his wife, she laughed, and looking into his eyes said: “Mme. Walter has taken a fancy to you!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe replied incredulously: “Nonsense!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“But I know it. She spoke of you to me with great enthusiasm. She said she would like to find two husbands like you for her daughters. Fortunately she is not susceptible herself.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe did not understand her and repeated: “Susceptible herself?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe replied in a tone of conviction: “Oh, Mme. Walter is irreproachable. Her husband you know as well as I. But she is different. Still she has suffered a great deal in having married a Jew, though she has been true to him; she is a virtuous woman.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy was surprised: “I thought her a Jewess.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“She a Jewess! No, indeed! She is the prime mover in all the charitable movements at the Madeleine. She was even married by a priest. I am not sure but that M. Walter went through the form of baptism.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGeorges murmured: “And — she — likes — me —”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. If you were not married I should advise you to ask for the hand of — Suzanne — would you not prefer her to Rose?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe replied as he twisted his mustache: “Eh! the mother is not so bad!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMadeleine replied: “I am not afraid of her. At her age one does not begin to make conquests — one should commence sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGeorges thought: “If I might have had Suzanne, ah!” Then he shrugged his shoulders: “Bah, it is absurd; her father would not have consented.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe determined to treat Mme. Walter very considerately in order to retain her regard. All that evening he was haunted by recollections of his love for Clotilde; he recalled their escapades, her kindness. He repeated to himself: “She is indeed nice. Yes, I shall call upon her to-morrow.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had lunched the following morning he repaired to Rue Verneuil. The same maid opened the door, and with the familiarity of an old servant she asked: “Is Monsieur well?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe replied: “Yes, my child,” and entered the drawing-room in which some one was practising scales. It was Laurine. He expected she would fall upon his neck. She, however, rose ceremoniously, bowed coldly, and left the room with dignity; her manner was so much like that of an outraged woman that he was amazed. Her mother entered. He kissed her hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How much I have thought of you,” said he.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“And I of you,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey seated themselves and smiled as they gazed into one another’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“My dear little Clo, I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“And I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Still — still — you did not miss me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes and no. I was grieved, but when I heard your reason, I said to myself: ‘Bah, he will return to me some day.’”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I dared not come. I did not know how I should be received. I dared not, but I longed to come. Now, tell me what ails Laurine; she scarcely bade me good morning and left the room with an angry air.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I do not know, but one cannot mention you to her since your marriage; I really believe she is jealous.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, my dear, she no longer calls you Bel-Ami, but M. Forestier instead.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy colored, then drawing nearer the young woman, he said: “Kiss me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe obeyed him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Where can we meet again?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“At Rue de Constantinople.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, are the apartments not rented?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“No, I kept them.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You did?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I thought you would return.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis heart bounded joyfully. She loved him then with a lasting love! He whispered: “I adore you.” Then he asked: “Is your husband well?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, very well. He has just been home for a month; he went away the day before yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy could not suppress a smile: “How opportunely that always happens!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe replied naively: “Yes, it happens opportunely, but he is not in the way when he is here; is he?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“That is true; he is a charming man!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How do you like your new life?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Tolerably; my wife is a comrade, an associate, nothing more; as for my heart —”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I understand; but she is good.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, she does not trouble me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe drew near Clotilde and murmured: “When shall we meet again?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“To-morrow, if you will.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, to-morrow at two o’clock.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe rose to take his leave somewhat embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You know I intend to take back the rooms on Rue de Constantinople myself. I wish to; it is not necessary for you to pay for them.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his hands, saying: “You may do as you like. I am satisfied to have kept them until we met again.” And Du Roy took his leave very well satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Thursday came, he asked Madeleine: “Are going to the fencing- match at Rival’s?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“No, I do not care about it. I will go to the chamber of deputies.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGeorges called for Mme. Walter in an open carriage, for the weather was delightful. He was surprised to find her looking so handsome and so young. Never had she appeared so fresh. Her daughter, Suzanne, was dressed in pink; her sister looked like her governess. At Rival’s door was a long line of carriages. Du Roy offered his arm to Mme. Walter and they entered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe entertainment was for the benefit of the orphans of the Sixth Ward under the patronage of all the wiles of the senators and deputies who were connected with “La Vie Francaise.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJacques Rival received the arrivals at the entrance to his apartments, then he pointed to a small staircase which led to the cellar in which were his shooting-gallery and fencing-room, saying: “Downstairs, ladies, downstairs. The match will take place in the subterranean apartments.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePressing Du Roy’s hand, he said: “Good evening, Bel-Ami.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy was surprised: “Who told you about that name?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRival replied: “Mme. Walter, who thinks it very pretty.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMme. Walter blushed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I confess that if I knew you better, I should do as little Laurine, and I should call you Bel-Ami, too. It suits you admirably.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy laughed. “I beg you to do so, Madame.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe cast down her eyes. “No, we are not well enough acquainted.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe murmured: “Permit me to hope that we shall become so.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we shall see,” said she.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey descended the stairs and entered a large room, which was lighted by Venetian lanterns and decorated with festoons of gauze. Nearly all the benches were filled with ladies, who were chatting as if they were at a theater. Mme. Walter and her daughters reached their seats in the front row.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy, having obtained their places for them, whispered: “I shall be obliged to leave you; men cannot occupy the seats.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMme. Walter replied hesitatingly: “I should like to keep you, just the same. You could tell me the names of the participants. See, if you stand at the end of the seat, you will not annoy anyone.” She raised her large, soft eyes to his and insisted: “Come, stay with us — Bel-Ami — we need you!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe replied: “I obey with pleasure, Madame!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Jacques Rival’s voice announced: “We will begin, ladies.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen followed the fencing-match. Du Roy retained his place beside the ladies and gave them all the necessary information. When the entertainment was over and all expenses were paid, two hundred and twenty francs remained for the orphans of the Sixth Ward.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy, escorting the Walters, awaited his carriage. When seated face to face with Mme. Walter, he met her troubled but caressing glance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Egad, I believe she is affected,” thought he; and he smiled as he recognized the fact that he was really successful with the female sex, for Mme. de Marelle, since the renewal of their relations, seemed to love him madly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith a light heart he returned home. Madeleine was awaiting him in the drawing-room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I have some news,” said she. “The affair with Morocco is becoming complicated. France may send an expedition out there in several months. In any case the ministry will be overthrown and Laroche will profit by the occasion.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy, in order to draw out his wife, pretended not to believe it. “France would not be silly enough to commence any folly with Tunis!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged her shoulders impatiently. “I tell you she will! You do not understand that it is a question of money — you are as simple as Forestier.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHer object was to wound and irritate him, but he only smiled and replied: “What! as simple as that stupid fellow?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe ceased and murmured: “Oh, Georges!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe added: “Poor devil!” in a tone of profound pity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMadeleine turned her back upon him scornfully; after a moment of silence, she continued: “We shall have some company Tuesday. Mme. Laroche-Mathieu is coming here to dine with Viscountess de Percemur. Will you invite Rival and Norbert de Varenne? I shall go to Mmes. Walter and de Marelle to-morrow. Perhaps, too, we may have Mme. Rissolin.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy replied: “Very well, I will see to Rival and Norbert.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe following day he thought he would anticipate his wife’s visit to Mme. Walter and attempt to find out if she really was in love with him. He arrived at Boulevard Malesherbes at two o’clock. He was ushered into the salon and waited. Finally Mme. Walter appeared and offered him her hand cordially. “What good wind blows you here?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“No good wind, but a desire to see you. Some power has impelled me hither, I do not know why; I have nothing to say except that I have come; here I am! Pardon the morning call and the candor of my explanation.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe uttered those words with a smile upon his lips and a serious accent in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn her astonishment, she stammered with a blush: “But indeed — I do not understand — you surprise me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe added: “It is a declaration made in jest in order not to startle you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey were seated near each other. She took the matter as a jest. “Is it a declaration — seriously?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, for a long time I have wished to make it, but I dared not; they say you are so austere, so rigid.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe had recovered her self-possession and replied:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you choose to-day?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I do not know.” Then he lowered his voice: “Or rather because I have thought only of you since yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly turning pale, she gasped: “Come, enough of this childishness! Let us talk of something else.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut he fell upon his knees before her. She tried to rise; he prevented her by twining his arms about her waist, and repeated in a passionate voice: “Yes, it is true that I have loved you madly for some time. Do not answer me. I am mad — I love you. Oh, if you knew how I love you!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe could utter no sound; in her agitation she repulsed him with both hands, for she could feel his breath upon her cheek. He rose suddenly and attempted to embrace her, but gaining her liberty for a moment, she escaped him and ran from chair to chair. He, considering such pursuit beneath his dignity, sank into a chair, buried his face in his hands, and feigned to sob convulsively. Then he rose, cried:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Adieu, adieu!” and fled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the hall he took his cane calmly and left the house saying: “Cristi! I believe she loves me!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe went at once to the telegraph office to send a message to Clotilde, appointing a rendezvous for the next day.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn entering the house at his usual time, he said to his wife: “Well, is everyone coming to dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe replied: “Yes, all but Mme. Walter, who is uncertain as to whether she can come. She acted very strangely. Never mind, perhaps she can manage it anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe replied: “She will come.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was not, however, certain and was rendered uneasy until the day of the dinner. That morning Madeleine received a message from Mme. Walter to this effect: “I have succeeded in arranging matters and I shall be with you, but my husband cannot accompany me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Roy thought: “I did right not to return there. She has calmed down.” Still he awaited her arrival anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared very composed, somewhat reserved, and haughty. He was very humble, very careful, and submissive. Mmes. Laroche-Mathieu and Rissolin were accompanied by their husbands. Mme. de Marelle looked bewitching in an odd combination of yellow and black.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt Du Roy’s right sat Mme. Walter, and he spoke to her only of serious matters with exaggerated respect. From time to time he glanced at Clotilde.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“She is really very pretty and fresh looking,” thought he. But Mme. Walter attracted him by the difficulty of the conquest. She took her leave early.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I will escort you,” said he.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe declined his offer. He insisted: “Why do you not want me? You wound me deeply. Do not let me feel that I am not forgiven. You see that I am calm.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe replied: “You cannot leave your guests thus.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled: “Bah! I shall be absent twenty minutes. No one will even notice it; if you refuse me, you will break my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Very well,” she whispered, “I will accept.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were seated in the carriage, he seized her hand, and kissing it passionately said: “I love you, I love you. Let me tell it to you. I will not touch you. I only wish to repeat that I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe stammered: “After what you promised me — it is too bad — too bad.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to make a great effort, then he continued in a subdued voice: “See, how I can control myself — and yet — let me only tell you this — I love you — yes, let me go home with you and kneel before you five minutes to utter those three words and gaze upon your beloved face.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe suffered him to take her hand and replied in broken accents: “No, I cannot — I do not wish to. Think of what my servants, my daughters, would say — no — no — it is impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe continued: “I cannot live without seeing you; whether it be at your house or elsewhere, I must see you for only a moment each day that I may touch your hand, breathe the air stirred by your gown, contemplate the outlines of your form, and see your beautiful eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe listened tremblingly to the musical language of love, and made answer: “No, it is impossible. Be silent!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke very low; he whispered in her ear, comprehending that it was necessary to win that simple woman gradually, to persuade her to appoint a meeting where she willed at first, and later on where he willed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Listen: I must see you! I will wait at your door like a beggar. If you do not come down, I will come to you, but I shall see you to- morrow.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe repeated: “No, do not come. I shall not receive you. Think of my daughters!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Then tell me where I can meet you — in the street — it matters not where — at any hour you wish — provided that I can see you. I will greet you; I will say, I love you; and then go away.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, almost distracted.
