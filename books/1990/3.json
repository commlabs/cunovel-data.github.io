I heard the latch click into place, and I turned off the shower and opened the door. All the doors in this house opened to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMomma shrugged and waved her hand. “Just be glad it was Ben. He’s easy to work. If it had been David or Rooster, I’d have had to show them a lot more than some cleavage and leg to get them off your scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, and the guilt from forcing my momma to flirt with a married cop to get me out of trouble settled in my stomach. “I’m sorry,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMomma stopped before walking into her room. “Don’t be. Someone needed to beat that shit’s truck up. I’m glad you did it.” Then she closed her bedroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there, and a smile tugged at my lips. I had never had many girlfriends in my life because no one understood me or wanted to get close to me. But my momma, she really was my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJASON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later, I was still thinking about the truck-bashing blonde. She was something else. Hard to forget. I had her baseball bat standing in the corner of my room, and I was trying to decide what to do with it. I figured right now she didn’t need the evidence on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, I shook my head. I was helping a girl get away with vandalism. That so wasn’t me. But it made me smile. Guess I needed a little action in my life. I intended to give it a few more days, then go see if I could catch her at home. I needed to give her back that bat, and I wanted to see her again. It was a good excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down the stairs in my brother’s summer house just as the front door opened and Jax and his girlfriend, Sadie, walked in. I had known they were coming down for the weekend, and I’d been expecting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax looked up at me and grinned. “Crashing your party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me, it’s a wild one. Hope you can handle it,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax shook his head and laughed. “Yeah, is it sad that I wish there was some truth to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadie pinched Jax’s arm playfully before walking over to give me a hug. “Ignore him. I think you’re perfect just like you are. No need for wild parties.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother’s girlfriend was beautiful in the head-turning kind of way. She had the kind of body and face you saw plastered on magazine covers. But Sadie was a small-town Sea Breeze girl and wanted nothing to do with the spotlight. She loved Jax and had learned to get over people splashing her face everywhere in the media, but before Jax she didn’t like drawing attention to herself. Which was impossible to avoid. The girl drew attention everywhere she went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Sadie. You can drop the rock-star life anytime you want and come live the simple, ordinary one with me,” I told her, and winked at Jax, who was now scowling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hands off, bro,” he said, reaching for Sadie’s arm. “Not funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat never ceased to entertain me. Jax had never had insecurities. Even before he became famous, he was the most confident kid I knew. But let a guy look at Sadie, and he went all territorial. It cracked me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it, Jax. You’re being silly,” Sadie said, frowning at him and making him immediately look regretful. That was even funnier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be mad,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadie looked back at me. “You up for some company? I thought we’d have a little get-together tonight. I want to see everyone, and since we’re only here two days, it would be easier if we just had the gang here.” She beamed up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, Sadie wasn’t mine, but she was hard to say no to. I was pretty sure if she smiled at anyone, they’d do whatever it was she was asking. “Sure,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax rolled his eyes at me, like he wasn’t a complete sucker when it came to her. What did he expect? I was a man. “I’ll go make sure the kitchen staff is prepared for the extra guests,” Jax told Sadie as he pressed a kiss to her cheek and started toward the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already called and talked to Ms. Mary. She’s prepared,” Sadie called after him. Ms. Mary ran the staff and the kitchen here. Once, Sadie had worked for Ms. Mary, so she knew her well. That was how Jax had met Sadie. She served him dinner one night, and I’m pretty sure he was sunk then. Even though he fought it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax stopped and turned around to give her the smile that magazines everywhere labeled as lethally sexy. “Then why don’t you help me to my room to unpack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Sadie’s cheeks turn red, and she pressed her lips together to keep from smiling. “Okay, if you need help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax walked back over to her. “Lots of help. You have no idea how much help I need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Either you two go to your room, or I’m going to throw ice water on you both,” I told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadie ducked her head, and Jax just grinned at me. “See you later,” he said as he held Sadie’s hand and led her up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided going out to the beach and out of this house for a while was the best idea. Not sure how much “unpacking” those two planned on doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive hours later, voices were getting louder downstairs as I stood in my bedroom, looking out over the front yard. I knew I needed to go downstairs. Jax would want me there. But those weren’t my friends. It wasn’t that I didn’t like them—I did. I just didn’t really know them. Then there was the matter of Preston Drake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dude was not a fan of mine. I had tried my hardest to get Amanda Hardy’s attention, only to lose her to Preston in the end. It’s hard to compete with bad boys with blond surfer hair. It wasn’t like I was in love with Amanda. Love wasn’t something I was looking for. Ever. She was just pretty and sweet. I liked that. It was easy with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on my door brought me out of my thoughts, and I turned to see my brother standing there with his hands in the front pockets of his jeans. “You planning on hiding up here all night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had considered it. I wasn’t great with people I didn’t know. I was on the quieter side. Jax was the personality in the family. “I was coming down in a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax cocked an eyebrow. “You look like you’d rather be anywhere else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “Not crazy about hanging out with people I don’t know that well. But I’m going to do it for Sadie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax walked into the room. “If you’re worried about Preston, don’t be. He’s really an easygoing guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled. He hadn’t seen the side of Preston I had. “Trust me, he isn’t very easygoing when it comes to Amanda.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not. But he’s got her. They’ve been together long enough now that he feels secure. You were dating the woman he was in love with. I can understand his moment of insanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJax would. He had dealt with the same thing with Marcus Hardy. They were friends now. Because Marcus was married and had a kid, he no longer posed a threat to Jax. Amanda and Marcus are brother and sister, and Marcus worked at the house the same summer Sadie did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming down there,” I told him. “I swear. Besides, I’m hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, because I suspect Sadie will be up here in the next five minutes if you don’t get down there. She’s worried about you feeling left out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reminded myself that I was doing this for Sadie. “Let’s go,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Jax to the stairs and took in the crowd gathering in the foyer as Sadie opened the door again to let in more of her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I had been with Amanda at Marcus and Willow’s wedding, I had met several of them. They all seemed really nice, but Preston was one of theirs. I wasn’t sure just how well they would accept me. I left Sea Breeze on good terms with everyone after the wedding. It was easy to see who it was Amanda wanted. I didn’t even try to win her over. The girl’s heart was obviously owned by Preston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus Hardy walked in, holding a baby in a red-and-white blanket that looked like it had an elephant on it. Sadie squealed in delight and hugged Marcus’s wife, Willow, and then reached out to take the baby from Marcus. Two years ago that scene wasn’t something any of them would have imagined. Marcus had been determined to get Sadie’s attention, but he couldn’t compete with Jax. But then, no one ever could compete with my brother. I never dared to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get him after Sadie,” Amanda’s voice called out just as I saw her walking into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get him all the time,” Sadie told her, smiling down at the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He loves his aunt Manda,” Amanda cooed over the baby. I hadn’t seen Amanda since Marcus and Willow’s wedding. Her long blond hair was hanging loose down her back, and she was wearing a skirt that showed off her tanned legs. Preston walked up behind her and placed his hand possessively on her hip, and I froze. This might be a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear to you he’s over it,” Jax whispered beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and started down the stairs toward the group. It wasn’t that I was scared of Preston—I just didn’t want to spend my night feeling like the unwanted guest. I was fine with not showing up to this thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cage and Eva are coming. They’re still getting used to life with a baby,” Willow told Sadie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t wait to see Bliss,” Sadie said with a happy sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother baby? Damn, this group was multiplying like rabbits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s gorgeous,” Willow said. “I’m not kidding you. Like, stop-in-your-tracks gorgeous. Her little cheeks are so chubby, and her eyes are Cage’s. Eva can’t take her anywhere without being stopped by a million people to ooh and aah over her.” She smiled happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the bottom step, and Sadie noticed us. She beamed brightly. I didn’t make eye contact with Amanda or even look in Preston’s direction. Instead I walked over to shake Marcus’s hand and congratulate him on the kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to see you,” Marcus said, grinning at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You too. Looks like you added another member to the family,” I replied. “Congrats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. He’s keeping me up at night, but I’m okay with it. It’s a good time to talk football. Teaching him early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and turned to Sadie, who was holding the little guy out for me to see him. “Jason, meet Eli Hardy,” she said in a soft voice reserved for babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to meet you, Eli,” I replied. The kid smiled and stuck his hand in his mouth. The little fluff of hair on his head was as red as his mother’s, but the kid reminded me of Marcus. Maybe it was his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hungry. We gonna stand around and look at babies all night, or is there food here?” a new voice said, drawing my attention from the baby. I recognized him, but I couldn’t remember his name. He had his dreadlocks pulled back in a ponytail. Tattoos decorated most of his arms, and he even had one coming up his neck. I didn’t stare long enough to figure out what it was. His lip was pierced, and when he talked you could see the metal in his mouth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/misbehaving-sea-breeze-6/page-3.html","bookId":1990,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:43 AM"}
