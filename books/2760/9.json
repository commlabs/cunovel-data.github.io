I don’t give a rat’s ass what happened with Amy. You’ll be on set and you’ll be cordial to her. So have fun with your brother, clear your head and get ready to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh into the phone. “You worry too much,” I tell him. “I’ll be fine. Amy won’t be a problem. Shooting will go off without a hitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It better,” he growls, then hangs up. I roll my eyes and toss my phone down. Tally tries to sound like an ass, but his bark is worse than his bite. At least, it is with my brothers and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish packing and then head to Providence to have lunch before I board my plane for home. I make my way inconspicuously through the restaurant and find my favorite table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI by-pass the hostess, but she sees me as she shows someone else their table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses at mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you spoken with Tally about me yet?” she asks, her hand on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “Not yet. I’m sorry. I haven’t had a chance. But I will soon. And I’ll give him your number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe I will. Tally can do what he wants with it. Melanie nods in satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. And if you need anything else from me, let me know.” Her tone is suggestive. I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I will. Is Alex here today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie nods as she starts to walk away. “Yeah. She’ll be with you shortly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I wait, I decide to hit the men’s room. As I pass down the long hall that leads to it, an office door is slightly ajar. I glance inside as I pass and am startled to see Alex sitting on the desk, her legs wrapped tightly around the manager’s waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze in place, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex has her arms wrapped around his neck, her wedding band glinting in the light. Her tongue is buried in manager’s throat. My heart feels heavy as I remember what she’d said to me before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry, dude. You’re hot and all, but I’m one of the few out there who believes that marriage is sacred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that sacred, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must feel someone staring, because she opens her eyes and sees me. She yanks away from the manager, her eyes wide. I don’t wait. I go to the restroom, wash my hands and then head back to my table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex is there within seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dominic, it wasn’t what you think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” I raise an eyebrow. “I’m pretty sure it was exactly what it looked like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe starts to protest, to offer lame explanations about how she needs the money and the manager was going to cut her hours, but I hold up a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not my business,” I tell her coldly. “And actually, I’ve lost my appetite today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, I get up and leave, ignoring her protests from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I drive away, I have to examine why I’m so annoyed. Because honestly, I’m pissed. And it shouldn’t be my business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it boils down to, though, is that I thought Alex was a decent person. One of the only decent people I’ve met in LA. And the fact that she’s like everyone else is depressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone wants to use everybody else. They want something, they need something. They are willing to do anything to get what they want. They’ll break marriage vows, cross lines of decency, stretch bounds of propriety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere does it end? And is there anyone out in the world who is a decent person? A person who is good on the inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m beginning to think that there’s not. In fact, I’m convinced of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh as I drive to the airport and board my plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, I’ll be home, just for the weekend. I can relax, soak in the wild atmosphere of Sin’s party and disappear into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can forget that people are greedy, black-hearted users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can forget it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the plane takes off, I close my eyes. The weariness of the world has gotten to me. The ugly side of life, the guilt that I carry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, it’s all just too much to bear so I cope in the only way I know how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the only thing I can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Kinkaide, is there anything else I can do for you?” I open my eyes at the polite voice and find a voluptuous blonde flight attendant bent in front of me, her chest straining at the buttons of her uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet her gaze and smile my most charming grin, the one I’m known for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, there is one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trail my fingers along the inside of her thigh and she smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-we-burn-beautifully-broken-2-5/page-9.html","bookId":2760,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:03 PM"}
