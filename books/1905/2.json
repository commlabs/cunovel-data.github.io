Oh God…this doesn’t feel like labor. There’s no…end…to it. Oh God…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here. Hold on to me.” Feeling wetness, Janet looked down, bit back an oath. Blood was dripping down Savannah’s legs. She pulled off her trim suit jacket, balled it up. “Open your legs, honey. It’s okay. Let’s just press this here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. No.” She changed her mind. Matt Kensington could scent a lie, but his wife’s radar was just as sharp, perhaps even more so in this state. The kid wouldn’t get anything past either one of them. “Savannah, you’re hemorrhaging. Let’s see if we can get that slowed down. Press your legs together, tight. I’m going to lay you down, get your hips propped up. I know it hurts, but try to stay as still as you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God the limo had backseats like wide couches. Janet had no idea if the change in position would help, but she couldn’t imagine Savannah being upright when blood was dripping out of her would be helpful. As she helped her maneuver, she saw Savannah’s gaze latch on to the front of Janet’s blouse. In changing her grip on the coat between Savannah’s legs, she’d smeared herself with a liberal amount of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Savannah’s jaw firmed. Shuddering with pain, she curled her arms tighter around her stomach. “I’m not losing you, angel. You stay with me. Matt…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Randall will call him first thing after the doctor. He’ll be on his way. It’s all right. Women can handle everything, remember? By the time Daddy gets there, the universe will be aligned, everything will be in balance. We’ll be sharing a latté and cooing over your new baby.” God willing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unh…” Savannah’s cry wrenched everything inside Janet, but she quelled it, keeping her hands steady over the woman’s. Her stomach was like a stale egg, no sense of movement or life, and she knew Savannah registered it as well. Janet met her gaze. “It’s going to be okay. The baby’s in there fighting. You can’t be scared. You don’t want to scare her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavannah nodded. She closed her eyes, tears of stress on her face, her lips pressed together tight. She tried to hum a little, like she had when she was on the park bench, and Janet joined her, smoothing her hands over her stomach, very lightly, since everything seemed to be causing Savannah pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she did that, a part of her stayed aware of other things. The world was flashing by, the limo moving in a zigzag pattern that was remarkably smooth, though constant. Constant movement didn’t happen in New Orleans traffic. When she tuned in to what was happening, she felt like she was perched on a roller coaster car, careening through a minefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax was maneuvering the limo between cars as if they were orange cones on a professional course. He never touched the horn, knowing New Orleans drivers were cantankerous enough to slam on brakes at such an insult, but Janet suspected he didn’t need the warning signal. All they had to do was look up in their mirror, see that black behemoth bearing down on them with no intent of stopping. If they weren’t fast enough to shift out of the way before he got there, he was already around them. He barely braked at the stoplights, not checking green or red, merely whether he had an access to get through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d heard that Max knew combat driving, part of his SEAL training, but she’d had no idea what it meant until now. Though she was a pretty adventurous driver herself, she wondered if it was the better part of valor to keep her full attention on Savannah. The decision was made when he dodged a traffic snarl by roaring up an alley, narrowly missing an officer on horseback. The cop shouted, but Janet would be surprised if he got anything more than two letters of the back plate before Max screeched around the next turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So…did Matt make you come with me today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back down. Savannah had gritted out the words, though she appeared to be concentrating for all she was worth on something deep inside of her. Though she’d never been one comfortable with intimate gestures, intuition had Janet stroking the woman’s hair back, then locking her hand with hers once again, all while keeping the other hand busy pressing the compress between Savannah’s legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You gave me the perfect opportunity to make my move with Max. I was just about to jump him in the front seat before you interrupted us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, I thought it was my day to jump him. Dana shouldn’t have all the fun.” Savannah gave her a grimace that passed as a smile, then she jacked forward over Janet’s hand “Oh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on, honey. You make any noise that helps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavannah shook her head, but the moans kept vibrating in her throat. Janet hummed the lullaby, rocking with Savannah, tiny movements that might help mitigate the pain, but not nearly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Rosen’s on the other line,” Randall barked through the speakers, because Max had kept the connection open with him. “She wants to know—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s bleeding badly, and her stomach is still hard. The pain is constant, going on six minutes now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet leaned forward to be sure Randall could hear her. The coat was getting heavier, telling Janet blood was soaking it. She could feel it trickling down her arm. When Max’s eyes coursed over her bloody blouse, his expression reflected her own reaction. “Fuck,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard garbled voices, Randall communicating with the doctor on another line, then he was back. “Max, where are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet saw the GPS had realized what kind of driver it had. The ETA was now ten minutes out, even though for a normal driver it would be twenty. Max merged onto the interstate, the limo shooting into the middle lane. As he did, the speedometer tipped past a hundred. Janet was aware of the cars flashing by outside, but that wasn’t her concern. Everything was blood and pain, Savannah gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About eight to ten minutes,” Max responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What—” Randall began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matt…” Savannah’s cry of agony blasted through the limo, bringing the security chief up short. Randall’s stomach had probably jumped into his throat, same as Janet’s had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has Matt been called?” Janet asked sharply, squeezing Savannah’s leg. Hold on, honey…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was already on his way back. He left the meeting early. He’s about thirty minutes away. Don’t crash into each other in the hospital parking lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He knew… Janet…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course he did. The man’s omniscient. You know that. It’s okay. It’s okay. You just focus on breathing, and getting you and that baby there. Dr. Rosen will make it right. Matt put the best baby doctor on the Eastern seaboard up in a penthouse apartment, just for you. Remember? He’s not going to let anything happen to this child, or to you. Savannah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet sharpened her tone, bringing Savannah’s attention back to her. “He takes care of you. You’re his. He’d expect you to remember that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something they never talked about directly, but of course Janet knew that Matt Kensington was a sexual Dominant. All five of the K\u0026amp;A top management team were. Their wives, including Savannah, were strong, fascinating and accomplished women, and every one of them was her respective Master’s submissive soulmate. Now, in this moment, where pain threatened to take away Savannah’s strength and courage, Janet reminded her she’d surrendered herself to Matt Kensington, trusting him utterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMission accomplished. Savannah’s blue eyes flickered as if Janet had thrown her a lifeline. The pregnant woman was wearing the delicate collar he’d given her, and her fingers went to it now, bloodying the rose quartz and silver. Her eyes closed against the pain, but the words she spoke were fierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t let him down. I won’t let either of them down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He knows that. They both do. We’ve got you. You keep thinking about that, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavannah’s eyes opened once more. Janet saw the strength of character that either impressed or scared the hell out of everyone who met Matt’s wife. “I’m going to fight, Janet, but if something happens, you tell them to save this little girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will, but a baby needs a mother. You fight, honey. Fight like you’ve never fought before. You survived over thirty years with that brute of a father of yours. This is a piece of cake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You always…know…so much. I’m glad Matt…has you.” Savannah’s head jerked back abruptly, her body contorting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here, I’m here.” Janet clung to her. “You listen to me. I’m not taking your place, I can damn sure tell you that. Working for him’s bad enough. Doesn’t matter how much money he has or what he can do to a woman with his dick. So you better not go anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavannah was well beyond smiling, but Janet’s resort to the shocking language made her strangle on a chuckle. “Can’t wait…to tell…him you said that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll deny it. Tell him you were delirious.” Glancing up, Janet was relieved to see the hospital sign flash by. The limo skidded to a halt at the emergency entrance. Underlining how serious the situation was, Dr. Rosen was already waiting with a gurney and a small army of medical personnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Max had brought the limo to a full halt, the ob-gyn surgeon had her hand on the door handle. Janet backed up, squeezing Savannah’s hand with one last reassurance before the medical staff swarmed into the limo like ants. She found the door behind her open, Max helping her out of the way, his hand on her elbow. He had his eyes fastened on what they were doing, the shocking pool of blood on the seat and floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing it herself, her knees started to wobble. No, she couldn’t do that. She had to listen to what they were saying, do what needed to be done, be ready to tell Matt everything he needed to know when he arrived. There would be paperwork to handle inside, because there always was. Most important, she needed to stay as close to Savannah as she could, as long as they would let her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/willing-sacrifice-knights-of-the-board-room-6/page-2.html","bookId":1905,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:27 PM"}
