{"id":93739,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"\u003cp\u003eDear Diary,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospect should feel scary, I suppose: my time on Earth has been so relatively short. A lot has happened to me, more than most people get to experience in a lifetime, but I still have so much to learn and do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m sure of Stefan, and I\u0027m sure about forever. All I can feel is overwhelming, riotous joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not even just Stefan and me, and the prospect of eternity to learn all the little things we don\u0027t know about each other, even yet: What was the color of Stefan\u0027s mother\u0027s eyes? What will his lips taste like, on a bright spring morning two hundred years from now? Where would he go, if he could go anywhere? And we can go everywhere. We\u0027ll have time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s so much of my happiness, but it\u0027s not all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally know who I am. It\u0027s ironic in a lot of ways that I should be a Guardian, when I loathed and feared them with such passion. But an Earthly Guardian is different; Andres has taught me that: I can be compassionate and loving and human, and I can use my Guardian Powers to protect my home, to protect the people I care about, to keep evil from destroying the innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s my bond with Damon, too. Finally I know how I can care for Damon and love Stefan at the same time. There\u0027s a connection between Damon and me that\u0027ll last forever, that will keep him from being consumed by the darkness that has always threatened him. No matter where he is, I\u0027ll hold a piece of him and he\u0027ll have a piece of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough everything, Stefan will be by my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with us will be all my beloved friends, each of them so powerful and good, each in their own way. I love them all so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trembling, but it\u0027s with anticipation. I\u0027m not afraid anymore. I can\u0027t wait to see what the future holds, for all of us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-45.html","bookId":2123,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:14 PM"}
