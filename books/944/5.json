{"id":41755,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"\u0026nbsp;Ronnie suppressed a sob. \"No, Daddy, don\u0027t let them take away my brain. Please—\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad stood very tall and very stiff, not even looking at him. \"They won\u0027t take your brain, just your memory for the past two years.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A corner of Mom\u0027s mouth twitched. \"David, I didn\u0027t want anything like this. I thought maybe Ronnie could have a few private psychiatric treatments. They can do wonderful things now—permi-hypnosis, creations of artificial psychic blocks. A memory-wash would mean that Ronnie\u0027d have the mind of a six-year-old child again. He\u0027d have to start to school all over again.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad returned to his chair. He buried his face in trembling hands, and some of his anger seemed replaced by despair. \"Lord, Edith, I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked up abruptly, as if struck by a chilling new thought. \"You can\u0027t keep a two-year memory-wash a secret. I never thought of that before. Why, that alone would mean the end of my promotions.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Silence settled over the room, punctuated only by the ticking of the antique clock. All movement seemed frozen, as if the room lay at the bottom of a cold, thick sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"David,\" Mom finally said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s only one solution. We can\u0027t destroy two years of Ronnie\u0027s memory—you said that yourself. So we\u0027ll have to take him to a psychiatrist or maybe a psychoneurologist. A few short treatments—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad interrupted: \"But he\u0027d still remember how to read, unconsciously anyway. Even permi-hypnosis would wear off in time. The boy can\u0027t keep going to psychiatrists for the rest of his life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thoughtfully he laced his fingers together. \"Edith, what kind of a book was he reading?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A tremor passed through Mom\u0027s slender body. \"There were three books on his bed. I\u0027m not sure which one he was actually reading.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad groaned. \"Three of them. Did you burn them?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, dear, not yet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. Ronnie seemed to like them so much. I thought that maybe tonight, after you d seen them—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Get them, damn it. Let\u0027s burn the filthy things.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mom went to a mahogany chest in the dining room, produced three faded volumes. She put them on the hassock at Dad\u0027s feet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad gingerly turned a cover. His lips curled in disgust as if he were touching a rotting corpse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Old,\" he mused, \"—so very old. Ironic, isn\u0027t it? Our lives are being wrecked by things that should have been destroyed and forgotten a hundred years ago.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A sudden frown contorted his dark features.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tick-de-tock, tick-de-tock, said the antique clock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A hundred years old,\" he repeated. His mouth became a hard, thin line. \"Edith, I think I know why Ronnie wanted to read, why he fell into the trap so easily.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean, David?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad nodded at the clock, and the slow, smouldering anger returned to his face. \"It\u0027s your fault, Edith. You\u0027ve always liked old things. That clock of your great-great-grandmother\u0027s. Those old prints on the wall. That stamp collection you started for Ronnie—stamps dated way back to the 1940\u0027s.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mom\u0027s face paled. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ve interested Ronnie in old things. To a child in its formative years, in a pleasant house, these things symbolize peace and security. Ronnie\u0027s been conditioned from the very time of his birth to like old things. It was natural for him to be attracted by books. And we were just too stupid to realize it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mom whispered hoarsely, \"I\u0027m sorry, David.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hot anger flashed in Dad\u0027s eyes. \"It isn\u0027t enough to be sorry. Don\u0027t you see what this means? Ronnie\u0027ll have to be memory-washed back to the time of birth. He\u0027ll have to start life all over again.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, David, no!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And in my position I can\u0027t afford to have an eight-year-old son with the mind of a new-born baby. It\u0027s got to be Abandonment, Edith, there\u0027s no other way. The boy can start life over in a reformatory, with a complete memory-wash. He\u0027ll never know we existed, and he\u0027ll never bother us again.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mom ran up to Dad. She put her hands on his shoulders. Great sobs burst from her shaking body.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can\u0027t, David! I won\u0027t let—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He slapped her then with the palm of his hand. The sound was like a pistol shot in the hot, tight air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad stood now like a colossus carved of black ice. His right hand was still upraised, ready to strike again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then his hand fell. His mind seemed to be toying with a new thought, a new concept.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He seized one of the books on the hassock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Edith,\" he said crisply, \"just what was Ronnie reading? What\u0027s the name of this book?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The—The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" said Mom through her sobs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He grabbed the second book, held it before her shimmering vision.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And the name of this?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tarzan of The Apes.\" Mom\u0027s voice was a barely audible croak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who\u0027s the author?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Edgar Rice Burroughs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And this one?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who wrote it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"L. Frank Baum.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He threw the books to the floor. He stepped backward. His face was a mask of combined sorrow, disbelief, and rage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Edith.\" He spat the name as if it were acid on his tongue. \"Edith, you can read!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3100/85426.html","bookId":944,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:30:17 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:30:17 AM"}
