The reception that Jennifer received on the morning she returned kept swelling, as attorneys from other offices dropped by to visit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCynthia, Dan and Ted had hung streamers across the room and a huge Welcome Back sign. There was champagne and cake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At nine o\u0027clock in the morning?\" Jennifer protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a madhouse here without you,\" Dan Martin told her. \"You\u0027re not planning to do this again, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at him and said, \"No. I\u0027m not planning to do this again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpected visitors kept dropping in to make sure Jennifer was all right and to wish her well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe parried questions about where she had been with a smile and \"We\u0027re not allowed to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held conferences all day with the members of her staff. Hundreds of telephone messages had accumulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ken Bailey was in Jennifer\u0027s office alone with her, he said, \"You know who\u0027s been driving us nuts trying to reach you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s heart leaped. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael Moretti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s weird. When we wouldn\u0027t tell him where you were, he made us swear you were all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about Michael Moretti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer went over all the cases that were being handled by the office. Business was excellent They had acquired a lot of important new clients. Some of the older clients refused to deal with anyone but Jennifer, and were waiting for her return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call them as soon as I can,\" Jennifer promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went through the rest of the telephone messages. There were a dozen calls from Mr. Adams. Perhaps she should have let Adam know that she was all right, that nothing had happened to her. But she knew she could not bear hearing his voice, knowing he was close and that she would not be able to see him, touch him, hold him. Tell him about Joshua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCynthia had clipped news stories she thought would be of interest to Jennifer. There was a syndicated series on Michael Moretti, calling him the most important Mafia leader in the country. There was a photograph of him and under it the caption, I\u0027m just an insurance salesman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Jennifer three months to catch up on her backlog of cases. She could have handled it more rapidly, but she insisted on leaving the office at four o\u0027clock every day, no matter what she was involved in. Joshua was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMornings, before Jennifer went to the office, she made Joshua\u0027s breakfast herself and spent as much time as possible playing with him before she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer came home in the afternoon, she devoted all of her time to Joshua. She forced herself to leave her business problems at the office, and turned down any cases that would take her away from her son. She stopped working weekends. She would let nothing intrude on her private world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved reading aloud to Joshua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mackey protested, \"He\u0027s an infant, Mrs. Parker. He doesn\u0027t understand a word you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer would reply confidently, \"Joshua understands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she would go on reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua was a series of unending miracles. When he was three months old he began cooing and trying to talk to Jennifer. He amused himself in his crib with a large, tinkling ball and a toy bunny that Ken had brought him. When he was six months old, he was already trying to climb out of his crib, restless to explore the world. Jennifer held him in her arms and he grabbed her fingers with his tiny hands and they carried on long and serious conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s days at the office were full. One morning she received a call from Philip Redding, president of a large oil corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if we could meet,\" he said. \"I have a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer did not have to ask him what it was. His company had been accused of paying bribes in order to do business in the Middle East. There would be a large fee for handling the case, but Jennifer simply did not have the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not available, but I can recommend someone who\u0027s very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was told not to take no for an answer,\" Philip Redding replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend of mine. Judge Lawrence Waldman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer heard the name with disbelief. \"Judge Waldman asked you to call me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you\u0027re the best there is, but I already knew that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer held the receiver in her hand, thinking of her previous experiences with Judge Waldman, how sure she had been that he hated her and was out to destroy her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Let\u0027s have breakfast tomorrow morning,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she had hung up, she placed a call to Judge Waldman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar voice came on the telephone. \"Well. I haven\u0027t talked to you in some time, young lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to thank you for having Philip Redding call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to make certain he was in good hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that, Your Honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you like to have dinner with an old man one evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was taken by surprise. \"I\u0027d love having dinner with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll take you to my club. They\u0027re a bunch of old fogies and they\u0027re not used to beautiful young women. It\u0027ll shake them up a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Lawrence Waldman belonged to the Century Association on West 43rd Street, and when he and Jennifer met there for dinner she saw that he had been teasing about old fogies. The dining room was filled with authors, artists, lawyers and actors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the custom not to make introductions here,\" Judge Waldman explained to Jennifer. \"It\u0027s assumed that every person is immediately recognizable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated at various tables, Jennifer recognized Louis Auchincloss, George Plimpton and John Lindsay, among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocially, Lawrence Waldman was totally different from what Jennifer had expected. Over cocktails he said to Jennifer, \"I once wanted to see you disbarred because I thought you had disgraced our profession. I\u0027m convinced that I was wrong. I\u0027ve been watching you closely. I think you\u0027re a credit to the profession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was pleased. She had encountered judges who were venal, stupid or incompetent. She respected Lawrence Waldman. He was both a brilliant jurist and a man of integrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Your Honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off the bench, why don\u0027t we make it Lawrence and Jennie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father was the only one who had ever called her Jennie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that, Lawrence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food was excellent and that dinner was the beginning of a monthly ritual they both enjoyed tremendously. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-30.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:27:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:27:16 PM"}
