{"id":26255,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 19 Burning","content":"The pain was bewildering.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Exactly that—I was bewildered. I couldn\u0027t understand, couldn\u0027t make sense of what was happening.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My body tried to reject the pain, and I was sucked again and again into a blackness that cut out wholeseconds or maybe even minutes of the agony, making it that much harder to keep up with reality.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I tried to separate them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Non-reality was black, and it didn\u0027t hurt so much.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Reality was red, and it felt like I was being sawed in half, hit by a bus, punched by a prize fighter,trampled by bulls, and submerged in acid, all at the same time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Reality was feeling my body twist and flip when I couldn\u0027t possibly move because of the pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Reality was knowing there was something so much more important than all this torture, and not beingable to remember what it was.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Reality had come on so fast.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　One moment, everything was as it should have been. Surrounded by people I loved. Smiles. Somehow,unlikely as it was, it seemed like I was about to get everything I\u0027d been fighting for.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And then one tiny, inconsequential thing had gone wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I\u0027d watched as my cup tilted, dark blood spilling out and staining the perfect white, and I\u0027d lurchedtoward the accident reflexively. I\u0027d seen the other, faster hands, but my body had continued to reach, tostretch___Inside me, something had yanked the opposite direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Ripping. Breaking. Agony.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The darkness had taken over, and then washed away to a wave of torture. I couldn\u0027t breathe—I haddrowned once before, and this was different; it was too hot in my throat.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Pieces of me shattering, snapping, slicing apart___More blackness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Voices, this time, shouting, as the pain came back.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\u0027The placenta must have detached!\"Something sharper than knives ripped through me—the words, making sense in spite of the othertortures. Detached placenta —I knew what that meant. It meant that my baby was dying inside me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Get him out!\" I screamed to Edward. Why hadn\u0027t he done it yet? \"He can\u0027t breathe! Do it now!\"\"The morphine—\"He wanted to wait, to give me painkillers, while our baby was dying?!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"No! Now—,\" I choked, unable to finish.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Black spots covered the light in the room as a cold point of new pain stabbed icily into my stomach. Itfelt wrong—I struggled automatically to protect my womb, my baby, my little Edward Jacob, but I wasweak. My lungs ached, oxygen burned away.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The pain faded away again, though I clung to it now. My baby, my baby, dying___How long had passed? Seconds or minutes? The pain was gone. Numb. I couldn\u0027t feel. I still couldn\u0027tsee, either, but I could hear. There was air in my lungs again, scraping in rough bubbles up and down mythroat.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"You stay with me now, Bella! Do you hear me? Stay! You\u0027re not leaving me. Keep your heart beating!\"Jacob? Jacob, still here, still trying to save me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Of course,I wanted to tell him. Of course I would keep my heart beating. Hadn\u0027t I promised them both?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I tried to feel my heart, to find it, but I was so lost inside my own body. I couldn\u0027t feel the things I should,and nothing felt in the right place. I blinked and I found my eyes. I could see the light. Not what I waslooking for, but better than nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　As my eyes struggled to adjust, Edward whispered, \"Renesmee.\"Renesmee?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Not the pale and perfect son of my imagination? I felt a moment of shock. And then a flood of warmth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Renesmee.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I willed my lips to move, willed the bubbles of air to turn into whispers on my tongue. I forced my numbhands to reach.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Let me... Give her to me.\"The light danced, shattering off Edward\u0027s crystal hands. The sparkles were tinged with red, with theblood that covered his skin. And more red in his hands. Something small and struggling, dripping withblood. He touched the warm body to my weak arms, almost like I was holding her. Her wet skin was hot—as hot as Jacob\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My eyes focused; suddenly everything was absolutely clear.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Renesmee did not cry, but she breathed in quick, startled pants. Her eyes were open, her expression soshocked it was almost funny. The little, perfectly round head was covered in a thick layer of matted,bloody curls. Heririses were a familiar—but astonishing—chocolate brown. Under the blood, her skin looked pale, acreamy ivory. All besides her cheeks, which flamed with color.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Her tiny face was so absolutely perfect that it stunned me. She was even more beautiful than her father.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Unbelievable. Impossible.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Renesmee,\" I whispered. \"So... beautiful.\"The impossible face suddenly smiled—a wide, deliberate smile. Behind the shell-pink lips was a fullcomplement of snowy milk teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　She leaned her head down, against my chest, burrowing against the warmth. Her skin was warm andsilky, but it didn\u0027t give the way mine did.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Then there was pain again—just one warm slash of it. I gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And she was gone. My angel-faced baby was nowhere. I couldn\u0027t see or feel her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　No!I wanted to shout. Give her back to me!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　But the weakness was too much. My arms felt like empty rubber hoses for a moment, and then they feltlike nothing at all. I couldn\u0027t feel them. I couldn\u0027t feel me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The blackness rushed over my eyes more solidly than before. Like a thick blindfold, firm and fast.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Covering not just my eyes but also my self with a crushing weight. It was exhausting to push against it. Iknew it would be so much easier to give in. To let the blackness push me down, down, down to a placewhere there was no pain and no weariness and no worry and no fear.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　If it had only been for myself, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to struggle very long. I was only human, with nomore than human strength. I\u0027d been trying to keep up with the supernatural for too long, like Jacob hadsaid.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　But this wasn\u0027t just about me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　If I did the easy thing now, let the black nothingness erase me, I would hurt them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Edward. Edward. My life and his were twisted into a single strand. Cut one, and you cut both. If hewere gone, I would not be able to live through that. If I were gone, he wouldn\u0027t live through it, either.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And a world without Edward seemed completely pointless. Edward had to exist.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Jacob—who\u0027d said goodbye to me over and over but kept coming back when I needed him. Jacob,who I\u0027d wounded so many times it was criminal. Would I hurt him again, the worst way yet? He\u0027d stayedfor me, despite everything. Now all he asked was that I stay for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　But it was so dark here that I couldn\u0027t see either of their faces. Nothing seemed real. That made it hardnot to give up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I kept pushing against the black, though, almost a reflex. I wasn\u0027t trying to lift it. I was just resisting. Notallowing it to crush me completely. I wasn\u0027t Atlas, and the black felt as heavy as a planet; I couldn\u0027tshoulder it. All I could do was not be entirely obliterated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It was sort of the pattern to my life—I\u0027d never been strong enough to deal with the things outside mycontrol, to attack the enemies or outrun them. To avoid the pain. Always human and weak, the only thingI\u0027d ever been able todo was keep going. Endure. Survive.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It had been enough up to this point. It would have to be enough today. I would endure this until helpcame.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I knew Edward would be doing everything he could. He would not give up. Neither would I.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I held the blackness of nonexistence at bay by inches.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It wasn\u0027t enough, though—that determination. As the time ground on and on and the darkness gained bytiny eighths and sixteenths of my inches, I needed something more to draw strength from.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I couldn\u0027t pull even Edward\u0027s face into view. Not Jacob\u0027s, not Alice\u0027s or Rosalie\u0027s or Charlie\u0027s orRenee\u0027s or Carlisle\u0027s or Esme\u0027s... Nothing. It terrified me, and I wondered if it was too late.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I felt myself slipping—there was nothing to hold on to.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　No!I had to survive this. Edward was depending on me. Jacob. Charlie Alice Rosalie Carlisle ReneeEsme...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Renesmee.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And then, though I still couldn\u0027t see anything, suddenly I could feel something. Like phantom limbs, Iimagined I could feel my arms again. And in them, something small and hard and very, very warm.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My baby. My little nudger.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I had done it. Against the odds, I had been strong enough to survive Renesmee, to hold on to her untilshe was strong enough to live without me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　That spot of heat in my phantom arms felt so real. I clutched it closer. It was exactly where my heartshould be. Holding tight the warm memory of my daughter, I knew that I would be able to fight thedarkness as long as I needed to.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The warmth beside my heart got more and more real, warmer and warmer. Hotter. The heat was so realit was hard to believe that I was imagining it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Hotter.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Uncomfortable now. Too hot. Much, much too hot.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Like grabbing the wrong end of a curling iron—my automatic response was to drop the scorching thingin my arms. But there was nothing in my arms. My arms were not curled to my chest. My arms weredead things lying somewhere at my side. The heat was inside me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The burning grew—rose and peaked and rose again until it surpassed anything I\u0027d ever felt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I felt the pulse behind the fire raging now in my chest and realized that I\u0027d found my heart again, just intime to wish I never had. To wish that I\u0027d embraced the blackness while I\u0027d still had the chance. I wantedto raise my arms and claw my chest open and rip the heart from it—anything to get rid of this torture. ButI couldn\u0027t feel my arms, couldn\u0027t move one vanished finger.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　James, snapping my leg under his foot. That was nothing. That was a soft place to rest on a feather bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I\u0027d take that now, a hundred times. A hundred snaps. I\u0027d take it and be grateful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The baby, kicking my ribs apart, breaking her way through me piece by piece. That was nothing. Thatwas floating in a pool of cool water. I\u0027d take it a thousand times. Take it and be grateful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The fire blazed hotter and I wanted to scream. To beg for someone to kill me now, before I lived onemore second in this pain. But I couldn\u0027t move my lips. The weight was still there, pressing on me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I realized it wasn\u0027t the darkness holding me down; it was my body. So heavy. Burying me in the flamesthat were chewing their way out from my heart now, spreading with impossible pain through myshoulders and stomach, scalding their way up my throat, licking at my face.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Why couldn\u0027t I move? Why couldn\u0027t I scream? This wasn\u0027t part of the stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My mind was unbearably clear—sharpened by the fierce pain—and I saw the answer almost as soon asI could form the questions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The morphine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It seemed like a million deaths ago that we\u0027d discussed it—Edward, Carlisle, and I. Edward and Carlislehad hoped that enough painkillers would help fight the pain of the venom. Carlisle had tried with Emmett,but the venom had burned ahead of the medicine, sealing his veins. There hadn\u0027t been time for it tospread.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I\u0027d kept my face smooth and nodded and thanked my rarely lucky stars that Edward could not read mymind.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Because I\u0027d had morphine and venom together in my system before, and I knew the truth. I knew thenumbness of the medicine was completely irrelevant while the venom seared through my veins. Butthere\u0027d been no way I was going to mention that fact. Nothing that would make him more unwilling tochange me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I hadn\u0027t guessed that the morphine would have this effect—that it would pin me down and gag me. Holdme paralyzed while I burned.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I knew all the stories. I knew that Carlisle had kept quiet enough to avoid discovery while he burned. Iknew that, according to Rosalie, it did no good to scream. And I\u0027d hoped that maybe I could be likeCarlisle. That I would believe Rosalie\u0027s words and keep my mouth shut. Because I knew that everyscream that escaped my lips would torment Edward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Now it seemed like a hideous joke that i was getting my wish fulfilled.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　If I couldn\u0027t scream, how could I tell them to kill me?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　All I wanted was to die. To never have been born. The whole of my existence did not outweigh thispain. Wasn\u0027t worth living through it for one more heartbeat.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Let me die, let me die, let me die.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And, for a never-ending space, that was all there was. Just the fiery torture, and my soundless shrieks,pleading for death to come. Nothing else, not even time. So that made it infinite, with no beginning and noend. One infinite moment of pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The only change came when suddenly, impossibly, my pain was doubled. The lower half of my body,deadened since before the morphine, was suddenly on fire, too. Some broken connection had beenhealed—knitted together by the scorching fingers of the flame.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The endless burn raqed on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It could have been seconds or days, weeks or years, but, eventually, time came to mean somethingagain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Three things happened together, grew from each other so that I didn\u0027t know which came first: timerestarted, the morphine\u0027s weight faded, and I got stronger.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could feel the control of my body come back to me in increments, and those increments were my firstmarkers of the time passing. I knew it when I was able to twitch my toes and twist my fingers into fists. Iknew it, but I did not act on it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Though the fire did not decrease one tiny degree—in fact, I began to develop a new capacity forexperiencing it, a new sensitivity to appreciate, separately, each blistering tongue of flame that lickedthrough my veins—I discovered that I could think around it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could remember why I shouldn\u0027t scream. I could remember the reason why I\u0027d committed to enduringthis unendurable agony. I could remember that, though it felt impossible now, there was something thatmight be worth the torture.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　This happened just in time for me to hold on when the weights left my body. To anyone watching me,there would be no change. But for me, as I struggled to keep the screams and thrashing locked up insidemy body, where they couldn\u0027t hurt anyone else, it felt like I\u0027d gone from being tied to the stake as Iburned, to gripping that stake to hold myself in the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I had just enough strength to lie there unmoving while I was charred alive.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My hearing got clearer and clearer, and I could count the frantic, pounding beats of my heart to mark thetime.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could count the shallow breaths that gasped through my teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could count the low, even breaths that came from somewhere close beside me. These moved slowest,so I concentrated on them. They meant the most time passing. More even than a clock\u0027s pendulum, thosebreaths pulled me through the burning seconds toward the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I continued to get stronger, my thoughts clearer. When new noises came, I could listen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　There were light footsteps, the whisper of air stirred by an opening door. The footsteps gotcloser, and Ifelt pressure against the inside of my wrist. I couldn\u0027t feel the coolness of the fingers. The fire blisteredaway every memory of cool.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Still no change?\"\"None.\"The lightest pressure, breath against my scorched skin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"There\u0027s no scent of the morphine left.\"\"I know.\"\"Bella? Can you hear me?\"I knew, beyond all doubt, that if I unlocked my teeth I would lose it—I would shriek and screech andwrithe andthrash. If I opened my eyes, if I so much as twitched a finger—any change at all would be the end of mycontrol.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Bella? Bella, love? Can you open your eyes? Can you squeeze my hand?\"Pressure on my fingers. It was harder not to answer this voice, but I stayed paralyzed. I knew that thepain in his voice now was nothing compared to what it could be. Right now he only feared that I wassuffering.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Maybe... Carlisle, maybe I was too late.\" His voice was muffled; it broke on the word late.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My resolve wavered for a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Listen to her heart, Edward. It\u0027s stronger than even Emmett\u0027s was. I\u0027ve never heard anything so vital.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Shell be perfect.\"Yes, I was right to keep quiet. Carlisle would reassure him. He didn\u0027t need to suffer with me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"And her—her spine?\"\"Her injuries weren\u0027t so much worse than Esme\u0027s. The venom will heal her as it did Esme.\"\"But she\u0027s so still. I must have done something wrong.\"\"Or something right, Edward. Son, you did everything I could have and more. I\u0027m not sure I would havehad the persistence, the faith it took to save her. Stop berating yourself. Bella is going to be fine.\"A broken whisper. \"She must be in agony.\"\"We don\u0027t know that. She had so much morphine in her system. We don\u0027t know the effect that will haveon her experience.\"Faint pressure inside the crease of my elbow. Another whisper. \"Bella, I love you. Bella, I\u0027m sorry.\"I wanted so much to answer him, but I wouldn\u0027t make his pain worse. Not while I had the strength tohold myself still.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Through all this, the racking fire went right on burning me. But there was so much space in my head now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Room to ponder their conversation, room to remember what had happened, room to look ahead to thefuture, with still endless room left over to suffer in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Also room to worry.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Where was my baby? Why wasn\u0027t she here? Why weren\u0027t they talking about her?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"No, I\u0027m staying right here,\" Edward whispered, answering an unspoken thought. \"They\u0027ll sort it out.\"\"An interesting situation,\" Carlisle responded. \"And I\u0027d thought I\u0027d seen just about everything.\"\"I\u0027ll deal with it later. We\u0027ll deal with it.\" Something pressed softly to my blistering palm.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"I\u0027m sure, between the five of us, we can keep it from turning into bloodshed.\"Edward sighed. \"I don\u0027t know which side to take. I\u0027d love to flog them both. Well, later.\"\"I wonder what Bella will think—whose side she\u0027ll take,\" Carlisle mused.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　One low, strained chuckle. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll surprise me. She always does.\"Carlisle\u0027s footsteps faded away again, and I was frustrated that there was no further explanation. Werethey talking so mysteriously just to annoy me?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I went back to counting Edward\u0027s breaths to mark the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Ten thousand, nine hundred forty-three breaths later, a different set of footsteps whispered into theroom. Lighter. More... rhythmic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Strange that I could distinguish the minute differences between footsteps that I\u0027d never been able to hearat all before today.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"How much longer?\" Edward asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"It won\u0027t be long now,\" Alice told him. \"See how clear she\u0027s becoming? I can see her so much better.\"She sighed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Still feeling a little bitter?\"\"Yes, thanks so much for bringing it up,\" she grumbled. \"You would be mortified, too, if you realized thatyou were handcuffed by your own nature. I see vampires best, because I am one; I see humans okay,because I was one. But I can\u0027t see these odd half-breeds at all because they\u0027re nothing I\u0027ve experienced.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Bah!\"\"Focus, Alice.\"\"Right. Bella\u0027s almost too easy to see now.\"There was a long moment of silence, and then Edward sighed. It was a new sound, happier.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"She\u0027s really going to be fine,\" he breathed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Of course she is.\"\"You weren\u0027t so sanguine two days ago.\"\"I couldn\u0027t see right two days ago. But now that she\u0027s free of all the blind spots, it\u0027s a piece of cake.\"\"Could you concentrate for me? On the clock—give me an estimate.\"Alice sighed. \"So impatient. Fine. Give me a sec—\"Quiet breathing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Thank you, Alice.\" His voice was brighter.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　How long?Couldn\u0027t they at least say it aloud for me? Was that too much to ask? How many moreseconds would I burn? Ten thousand? Twenty? Another day—eighty-six thousand, four hundred? Morethan that?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"She\u0027s going to be dazzling.\"Edward growled quietly. \"She always has been.\"Alice snorted. \"You know what I mean. Look at her.\"Edward didn\u0027t answer, but Alice\u0027s words gave me hope that maybe I didn\u0027t resemble the charcoalbriquette I felt like. It seemed as if I must be just a pile of charred bones by now. Every cell in my bodyhad been razed to ash.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I heard Alice breeze out of the room. I heard the swish of the fabric she moved, rubbing against itself. Iheard the quiet buzz of the light hanging from the ceiling. I heard the faint wind brushing against theoutside of the house. I could hear everything.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Downstairs, someone was watching a ball game. The Mariners were winning by two runs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"It\u0027s my turn\" I heard Rosalie snap at someone, and there was a low snarl in response.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Hey, now,\" Emmett cautioned.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Someone hissed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I listened for more, but there was nothing but the game. Baseball was not interesting enough to distractme from the pain, so I listened to Edward\u0027s breathing again, counting the seconds.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Twenty-one thousand, nine hundred seventeen and a half seconds later, the pain changed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　On the good-news side of things, it started to fade from my fingertips and toes. Fading slowly, but atleast it was doing something new. This had to be it. The pain was on its way out...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And then the bad news. The fire in my throat wasn\u0027t the same as before. I wasn\u0027t only on fire, but I wasnow parched, too. Dry as bone. So thirsty. Burning fire, and burning thirst...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Also bad news: The fire inside my heart got hotter.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　How was that possible?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My heartbeat, already too fast, picked up—the fire drove its rhythm to a new frantic pace.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Carlisle,\" Edward called. His voice was low but clear. I knew that Carlisle would hear it, if he were inor near the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The fire retreated from my palms, leaving them blissfully pain-free and cool. But it retreated to my heart,which blazed hot as the sun and beat at a furious new speed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Carlisle entered the room, Alice at his side. Their footsteps were so distinct, I could even tell thatCarlisle was on the right, and a foot ahead of Alice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Listen,\" Edward told them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The loudest sound in the room was my frenzied heart, pounding to the rhythm of the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Ah,\" Carlisle said. \"It\u0027s almost over.\"My relief at his words was overshadowed by the excruciating pain in my heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My wrists were free, though, and my ankles. The fire was totally extinguished there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Soon,\" Alice agreed eagerly. \"I\u0027ll get the others. Should I have Rosalie... ?\"\"Yes—keep the baby away.\"What? No. No! What did he mean, keep my baby away? What was he thinking?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My fingers twitched—the irritation breaking through my perfect facade. The room went silent besidesthe jack-hammering of my heart as they all stopped breathing for a second in response.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　A hand squeezed my wayward fingers. \"Bella? Bella, love?\"Could I answer him without screaming? I considered that for a moment, and then the fire ripped hotterstill through my chest, draining in from my elbows and knees. Better not to chance it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\u0027Til bring them right up,\" Alice said, an urgent edge to her tone, and I heard the swish of wind as shedarted away.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And then— oh!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My heart took off, beating like helicopter blades, the sound almost a single sustained note; it felt like itwould grind through my ribs. The fire flared up in the center of my chest, sucking the last remnants of theflames from therest of my body to fuel the most scorching blaze yet. The pain was enough to stun me, to break throughmy iron grip on the stake. My back arched, bowed as if the fire was dragging me upward by my heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I allowed no other piece of my body to break rank as my torso slumped back to the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It became a battle inside me—my sprinting heart racing against the attacking fire. Both were losing. Thefire was doomed, having consumed everything that was combustible; my heart galloped toward its lastbeat.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The fire constricted, concentrating inside that one remaining human organ with a final, unbearable surge.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The surge was answered by a deep, hollow-sounding thud. My heart stuttered twice, and then thuddedquietly again just once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　There was no sound. No breathing. Not even mine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　For a moment, the absence of pain was all I could comprehend.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And then I opened my eyes and gazed above me in wonder.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/151/5986.html","bookId":740,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 11:54:13 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 11:54:13 PM"}
