She signs up for 10 days of training with the Israel Defense Force as soon as she finds out that her long-distance boyfriend, Avi, will be on base as well. But things turn out to be different from what she\u0027d hoped for. She sleeps in a bunk bed underneath coils that look ready to give way, she\u0027s being worked to the bone, and the bathrooms are hardly up to her standards. Worst of all, Avi doesn\u0027t seem remotely thrilled that she\u0027s there. Is something going on between him and a fellow soldier? Strong, beautiful, and able to be with Avi all the time, Liron is everything Amy wants to be. Even though the plot is predictable, readers can\u0027t help but get drawn in by Amy\u0027s fun way of telling her story, and they learn a lot about Israeli teens\u0027 mandatory military service. Elkeles catches new readers up to speed in no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:17 PM"}
