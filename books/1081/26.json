{"id":45031,"no":26,"title":"THIRD BOOK “And he shall win many followers” I THE OASIS AND THE DESERT","content":"In the spring of 1894 the Etna railway was begun; in the autumn of 1895 it was finished. It went up from the shore, made a circuit round the mountain in a wide half-circle, and came down again to the shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Trains come and go every day, and Mongibello lies subdued and makes no sign. Foreigners pass with amazement through the black, distorted lava streams, through the groves of white almond-trees, through the dark old Saracen towns. “Look, look! is there such a land on earth!” they say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the railway carriages there is always some one telling of the time when the Christ-image was in Diamante.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What a time! What a time! Each day new miracles were performed. They cannot tell of them all, but he brought as much happiness to Diamante as if the hours of the day had been dancing maidens. People thought that Time had filled his hour-glass with shining sands of gold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [324]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If any one had asked who reigned in Diamante at that time, the answer would have been that it was the Christ-image. Everything was done according to his will. No one took a wife, or played in a lottery, or built himself a house without consulting him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many knife-thrusts were spared for the image’s sake, many old feuds settled, and many bitter words were never uttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The people had to be good, for they observed that the image helped those who were peaceable and helpful. To them he granted the pleasant gifts of happiness and riches.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If the world had been as it ought to be, Diamante would soon have become a rich and powerful town. But instead, that part of the world which did not believe in the image destroyed all his work. All the happiness he scattered about him was of no avail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The taxes were constantly increased, and took all their money. There was the war in Africa. How could the people be happy when their sons, their money, and their mules had to go to Africa? The war did not go well; one defeat followed another. How could they be happy when their country’s honor was at stake?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Especially after the railway had been finished was it manifest that Diamante was like an oasis in a great desert. An oasis is exposed to the drifting sands of the desert and to robbers and wild beasts. So was also Diamante. The oasis would have to spread over the whole desert to feel secure. Diamante began to believe that it could never be happy until the whole world worshipped its Christ-image.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [325]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It now happened that everything that Diamante hoped and strove for was denied it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Donna Micaela and all Diamante longed to get Gaetano back. When the railway was ready Donna Micaela went to Rome and asked for his release, but it was refused her. The king and the queen would have liked to help her, but they could not. You know who was minister then. He ruled Italy with a hand of iron; do you think that he allowed the king to pardon a rebellious Sicilian?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The people also longed that the Christchild of Diamante should have the adoration that was his due, and Donna Micaela sought an audience for his sake with the old man in the Vatican. “Holy Father,” she said, “let me tell you what has been taking place in Diamante on the slopes of Etna!” And when she had told of all the miracles performed by the image, she asked the pope to have the old church of San Pasquale purified and consecrated, and to appoint a priest for the worship of the Christchild.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dear Princess Micaela,” said the pope, “those incidents of which you speak, the church dares not consider miracles. But you need not at all despair. If the Christchild wishes to be worshipped in your town, he will give one more sign. He will show Us his will so plainly that We shall not need to hesitate. And forgive an old man, my daughter, because he has to be cautious!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A third thing the people of Diamante had hoped. They had expected at last to hear something from Gaetano. Donna Micaela journeyed also to Como, where he was held prisoner. She had letters of recommendation from the highest quarters in Rome,[326] and she was sure that she would be allowed to speak to him. But the director of the prison sent her to the prison doctor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The latter forbade her to speak to Gaetano.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You wish to see the prisoner?” he said. “You shall not do it. Do you say that he loves you and believes you to be dead? Let him think it! Let him believe it! He has bowed his head to Death. He suffers no longing. Do you wish him to know that you are alive, so that he may begin to long? You wish, perhaps, to kill him? I will tell you something; if he begins to long for life, he will be dead within three months.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He spoke so positively that Donna Micaela understood that she must give up seeing Gaetano. But what a disappointment, what a disappointment!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she came home, she felt like one who has dreamt so vividly that he cannot, even after he is awake, rouse himself from his visions. She could not realize that all her hopes had been a mockery. She surprised herself time after time thinking: “When I have saved Gaetano.” But now she no longer had any hope of saving him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She thought now of one, now of another enterprise, on which she wished to embark. Should she drain the plain, or should she begin to quarry marble on Etna. She hesitated and wondered. She could not keep her mind on anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The same indolence that had taken possession of Donna Micaela crept through the whole town. It was soon plain that everything that depended on people who did not believe in the Christchild of Diamante was badly managed and unsuccessful. Even the Etna railway was conducted in the wrong[327] way. Accidents were happening constantly on the steep inclines; and the price of the tickets was too high. The people began to use the omnibuses and post wagons again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Donna Micaela and others with her began to think of carrying the Christ-image out into the world. They would go out and show how he gave health and subsistence and happiness to all who were quiet and industrious and helped their neighbor. If people could once see, they would certainly be converted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The image ought to stand on the Capitol and govern the world,” said the people of Diamante.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All those who govern us are incapable,” said the people. “We prefer to be guided by the holy Christchild.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The Christchild is powerful and charitable; if he ruled us, the poor would be rich, and the rich would have enough. He knows who wish to do right. If he should come to power, they who now are ruled would sit in the parliament. He would pass through the world like a plough with a sharp edge, and that which now lies unprofitable in the depths would then bear harvests.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before their longed-for plans came to pass, however, in the first days of March, 1896, the news of the battle at Adna arrived. The Italians had been defeated, and several thousands of them were killed or taken prisoners.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few days later there was a change of ministry in Rome. And the man who came to power was afraid of the rage and despair of the Sicilians. To pacify them he pardoned out several of the imprisoned socialists. The five for whom he thought the people[328] longed most were set free. They were Da Felice, Bosco, Verro, Barbato and Alagona.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, Micaela tried to be glad when she heard it. She tried not to weep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had believed that Gaetano was in prison because the Christ-image was to break down the walls of his cell. He was sent there by the grace of God, because he had to be forced to bow his head before the Christchild and say: “My Lord and my God.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now it was not the image which had freed him; he would come out the same heathen as before; the same yawning chasm would still exist between them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She tried to be glad. It was enough that he was free. What did she or her happiness matter in comparison to that!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it happened so with everything for which Diamante had hoped and striven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The great desert was very cruel to the poor oasis.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1787/52039.html","bookId":1081,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:08:55 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:08:55 AM"}
