So we’ve got a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhage blinked once. And then threw his head back and laughed so loudly the windows shook. “This is the best fucking Christmas present ever!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you, Hollywood!” Lassiter yelled from inside the chimney. “Fuck you so hard—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrothers started filing in, and Rhage was all over it, reporting the situation—while nearly wetting his pants laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Rhage marched over, put his hands on his knees, and hollered up, “How’s it feel to be a proctologist, angel! You like that tight squeeze? I’d call you something else but my daughter’s in earshot. Starts with ‘d’ and ends with an ‘o,’ though!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m gonna kill you as soon as I’m out of here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want a Little Mermaid doll to keep you company? Or, wait, I’ll send that stuffed tarpon up—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eat me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two exchanged festive holiday cheer, and the rest of the household gathered around and laughed until they were hoarse, and V decided that maybe they could run a chain from the back of Ruhn’s new truck, Mary stepped out of the way and just watched her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocusing on Bitty, she smiled and stroked the girl’s long dark hair. “What, my love?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Merry Christmas, Mom.” The little girl came in for a hug. “This was the best Christmas ever, don’t you think? I mean, I know it’s my first, but I don’t think it gets any better than this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary tucked her daughter in close, looked at the load of opened presents and the acres of crushed wrapping paper and the utter and complete chaos … and found herself filled with such joy, her body and soul became a happy balloon, bouncing in the air even as she stayed with her feet on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Bitty, Christmas doesn’t get any better than this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitty frowned. “Are they ever going to get him out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary laughed. “Yes.
