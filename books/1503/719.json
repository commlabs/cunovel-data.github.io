The wings were glowing with a layer of green light, which engulfed the Consolidating Paper, causing them to land on her spread wings, glued close to them and in neat order.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlong the ten metre broad Wings of the Wind God, there were now a total of fifty Consolidating Papers lined up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level, he naturally did not need Shangguan Bing’er’s help. However, he was now displaying a power level of a five-Jeweled stage, and he could not show off too much. Hiding his cultivation stage was definitely necessary; otherwise if he showed that he had already entered the Heavenly Dao Energy stage, he would definitely be looked upon as even more of a monster, and they might even grow wary of him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat was he doing? Fifty pieces of Consolidating Paper? Was he going to use them all to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls? How long would that take?

They were more than happy to see this new God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master show off his strength, to see if he truly deserved the position of Consecrated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnce again, Zhou Weiqing waved both hands. This time, fifty small crystal bottles appeared, each holding different types of Consolidating Ink. The bottles landed on a Consolidating Paper each. Of course, once again it seemed like Shangguan Bing’er was using her Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy to help him in doing so.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis time, neither Dreamwake nor Nie Han could remain seated. Almost simultaneously, both of them stood up and walked from behind the table, standing at a position not far from Zhou Weiqing’s back. That was because both of them could tell that those Consolidating Equipment Scrolls that Zhou Weiqing was about to create were actually fifty different kinds!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing turned around, smiling to Dreamwake as he said: “Dreamwake, can you please lend me two Consolidating Pens?

Although the two were not as high quality as the one Zhou Weiqing had used previously on the test day to create the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll, they were definitely high quality ones.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the two Consolidating Pens in hand, Zhou Weiqing turned back to Shangguan Bing’er’s back. With a Consolidating Pen in each hand, he lifted his arms slightly, closing his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs the center of attention of the entire hall, as soon as Zhou Weiqing made that action, all of them could sense his aura suddenly change.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing was a mere five-Jeweled cultivation level to those present, and in their eyes, such a cultivation stage amounted to nothing. However, in that instant, the feeling he gave them all was that of an insurmountable mountain they could only look up to. His entire aura and presence seemed to have raised to a state that was far above anyone present. This was not a martial presence, but a unique quality that seemed to come from within. Just like a mountain range, or the flowing clouds in the skies, not able to be suppressed externally.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDreamwake stood at the closest position to Zhou Weiqing, and she just able to see his side profile.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Zhou Weiqing was not especially handsome, but the unique quality and aura that he emitted, especially the state of being one with the world, actually caused the heartstrings within her that had never been moved before to shiver slightly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA strong and confident man was absolutely attractive, especially one who had such peerless talent and genius; that was an irresistible attraction indeed. This talent was further exacerbated by the fact that he was just so young. Compared to those suave and handsome fellows who were merely pewter spearhead that shines like silver \u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e, only a man like Zhou Weiqing had the greatest draw to those women with real inner beauty and intelligence.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was exactly because of this fact that Zhou Weiqing had so many beauties surrounding him, falling for him. If not for his talent that far surpassed everyone, allowing him to emerge and prove himself amongst all the other young geniuses in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, perhaps he would not even have had the chance to meet Shangguan Fei’er and Shangguan Xue’er. Furthermore, if not for the fact his bloodline and Attributes had such a strong attraction for Tian’er, they would not have met, and not have the chance to be together.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe reason why Zhou Weiqing could draw the attention and favour of so many girls, besides that ‘bad-boy’ look that was perhaps easier at making them notice him, was the strong resolution and willpower deep in his bones, his sense of justice, his own power and sheer talent, as well as his heart and deep sincerity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEven a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master like Dreamwake couldn’t help but subconsciously feel attracted to him. Of course, it was merely an admiration due to his strong talent, but it was clear that at least he had left a deep impression in her mind.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNaturally, Zhou Weiqing did not know that his outstanding performances had already given Dreamwake a different feeling towards him. Instead, currently he was actually fully immersed in a unique, almost miraculous state.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEver since he had graduated from Huyan Aobo’s teachings, Zhou Weiqing had actually not spent much time and effort on the creation of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Even so, the time he had spent with Huyan Aobo and his teachings had left him with a very solid foundation. At that time, in order not to hold up Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation, Huyan Aobo had just transferred all of his knowledge to him in one fell swoop, many of which he asked Zhou Weiqing to just memorize first.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s memory was extremely good, and at least in the past few years he had not forgotten anything he had learned from Huyan Aobo. As such, even though he had not spent much time and effort on Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, in terms of knowledge, he was at least no less than Yun Li. Furthermore, the first time he had been in the Heavenly Jewel Island, he had also been taught and guided by the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters for a period of time. As such, his outlook and horizons in that sense were more than sufficient to reach that of a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. Do not forget that he had personally witnessed the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters helping him create all those God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs his Saint Energy had reached the nine-Jeweled stage, it had greatly improved his senses and mind; in this short period of time he had managed to integrate all of the knowledge he had memorized in the past.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTo a genius, especially one with Saint Energy, it was always a bountiful harvest to absorb the summarized experience of their predecessors. In truth, when Zhou Weiqing was taking The Pearl to reach the XuanTian Continent, he had already begun absorbing knowledge, to prepare to create some for himself and Shangguan Bing’er. In this regard, Shangguan Bing’er did not know. This was also one of the strongest points of Zhou Weiqing compared to most others, his sense of the big picture as well as preparing himself for the future. As such, he might not be a good general, but he had the potential to become an outstanding commander. The only thing was he did not focus his time and energies on military matters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe creation of that God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll a few days ago had indeed helped Zhou Weiqing corroborate, verify and further affirm much of the knowledge he had begun to understand, allowing him to fully master and comprehend it thoroughly at last. In the next few days after his deep sleep, Zhou Weiqing had a whole new feeling, as if he had truly become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. Of course, this new God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master currently still required the use of his ‘cheating’ Time Attribute to fully succeed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll of the XuanTian Palace powerhouses consciously slowed their breathing and withdrew their auras, causing the entire massive hall to silence instantly, afraid they might affect Zhou Weiqing and leave a bad impression to this young God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing did not make them wait too long.

On the contrary, every action he made seemed to have a unique rhythm, a feeling that was just so enjoyable to watch. Every movement so harmonious and in accord, as if with everything under control, yet at such an unbelievable speed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe two Consolidating Pens dipped into their respective Consolidating Inks.

What Zhou Weiqing was doing now seemed to be violating this basic principle. After all, every different Consolidating Equipment Scroll’s creation process would also have very different rhythms. At this very instant, he was actually showing the use of two different rhythms at once!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe silver and green colours began to mix and merge together on the tip of the Consolidating Pens. Zhou Weiqing actions, even those surrounding top ranked Heavenly Jewel Masters couldn’t see clearly.
