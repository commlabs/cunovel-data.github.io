ALONG THE TRAIL.","content":"When they left the main body of the party behind, Ralph, Harry Ware, and young Simmons had kicked their ponies into a brisk “lope,” which speedily carried them some distance ahead. As they rode along, they gazed admiringly about them at the beauties of the rugged trail. The rough way soon left the tunnel-like formation of spruce and tamarack, and emerged on a muskeg, or patch of swampy ground, where rank, green reeds and flowers of gorgeous red, yellow and blue grew in the wetter places.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As they cantered into the midst of this pretty bit of scenery, a striped animal sprang from behind a patch of brush with a snort, and dashed off into the timber on the hillside beyond.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [56]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a whoop and yell the boys, headed by Ralph, were after it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A wild cat!” shouted Ralph. “After him, boys!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their lively little ponies appeared quite to enter into the spirit of the chase. At any rate, they needed no urging, but darted off as nimbly as mountain goats among the trees. The gray and reddish form of the wild cat was speedily lost sight of; but Ralph, who had slipped his rifle from its holster, still kept on under the shadows of the forest, followed by the others.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly he thought he saw an elusive form slipping among the timbers ahead of him. Flinging the reins of his pony over the creature’s head, in Western fashion, he dismounted. Hardware and Persimmons followed his example. The eyes of all three boys were shining with the excitement of this, their first adventure in the Canadian wilds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Cantering cayuses, boys, but we’ll have a fine[57] skin to take home before we’ve been on the trail ten minutes!” exclaimed Persimmons under his breath, as they crept along behind Ralph.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t count your skins before you get ’em,” was Hardware’s advice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this moment there was a sudden commotion among the ponies. They snorted and sniffed as if in terror of something, and Ralph rightly guessed that they had just scented the wild cat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You fellows go back and quiet ’em; I’ll keep on,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dearly as his two companions would have liked to continue on the trail of the wild cat, there was nothing for them to do but to obey; for if the ponies stampeded they knew that Mountain Jim would have something to say that might not sound pleasant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Be careful now, Ralph,” warned Hardware, as their comrade kept on alone. “Wild cats are pretty ugly customers sometimes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Ralph did not reply. With a grim look on[58] his face and with his rifle clutched tightly, he slipped from trunk to trunk, his feet hardly making any noise on the soft woodland carpet of pine needles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly, from a patch of brush right ahead of him, came a sort of yelping cry, not unlike that of a dog in pain or excitement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What on earth is up now?” he wondered to himself, coming to a halt and searching the scene in front of him with eager eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then came sounds of a furious commotion. The brush was agitated and there were noises as if two animals were in mortal combat in front of him. But still he could see nothing. All at once came distinctly the crunching of bones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s that wild cat and she’s made a kill of some sort, a rabbit probably,” mused Ralph. “Well, I’ll catch her red-handed and revenge poor Molly Cottontail.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He cautiously tiptoed forward, making as little noise as possible. He was well aware that a cornered[59] wild cat can make a formidable opponent, and he did not mean to risk wounding the animal slightly and infuriating it. He was raising his rifle with a view to having it ready the instant he should sight the savage wood’s creature, when he stepped on a dead branch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It emitted a sharp crack, almost like a pistol shot, and Ralph bit his lip with vexation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That cat’s going to run now, taking its prey along, and I’ll not get within a mile of it,” was his thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But no such thing happened. Instead, from the bushes, there came an angry, snarling growl as the crunching of bones abruptly ceased. Ralph’s heart began to beat a little quicker. It appeared that the cat, far from fleeing, was going to show fight. But Ralph, after his first surprise, did not worry: He knew his automatic would be more than a match for the wild cat if it came down to a fight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With this thought in his mind he pressed boldly[60] forward, parting the bushes as he went. He had not advanced more than a few yards when he came upon a curious sight. A lithe, tawny creature of reddish color, with oddly tufted ears, was crouched over the dead and torn body of a rabbit. It had been savagely rending the smaller animal, and as Ralph took all this in he realized, too, another fact. It was no wild cat that he had disturbed, but another and a far more formidable animal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Great juniper! A Canadian lynx, and a whumper, too!” gasped the boy to himself as he gazed at the creature which was almost as large as a good sized dog.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment the realization that he was face to face with an animal that some hunters have described as being more formidable than a mountain lion, made Ralph pause, while his heart thumped in lively fashion. The great yellow eyes of the lynx, whose tufted ears lay flat against its head, regarded him with blazing hatred. Its[61] teeth were bared under its reddened fangs, and Ralph saw that it was ready to spring at him. It was only waiting to measure its distance accurately.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll give her all I’ve got in the gun,” thought Ralph, bringing the weapon to bear; “my only chance is to finish her quick.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His finger pressed the trigger, but, to his amazement, no report followed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Great guns! The mechanism has stuck and I’ve not got an instant to fuss with it,” was the thought that flashed through his mind as the rifle failed to go off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had no time for more. With a growl and snarl the tawny body was launched into the air, as if propelled toward him by chilled steel springs. Ralph gave a hasty, almost involuntary step backward. His foot caught in an out-cropping root and the next instant he measured his length on the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he fell he was conscious of a flash passing[62] before his face and caught a glimpse of two yellow eyes blazing with deadly hate and anger. The next instant there was a crash in the brush just beyond where he lay, and the boy realized that his fall had been the luckiest thing in the world for him. The lynx had overleaped him; but he knew that the respite would not last the fraction of a minute. He was in as great peril as before unless he acted and that quickly.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1625/48111.html","bookId":1230,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:51:21 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:51:21 AM"}
