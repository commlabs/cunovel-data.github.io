He’s very good at what he does. Very disciplined. Under him the Bonannos have become the strongest of the five Mafia families. Frank Russo was one of Granata’s most dependable and ruthless capos. He wanted to use the Bonanno muscle to force the other families into a kind of European Union, five independent families but all of them under a single leadership umbrella—Granata’s umbrella. From a strictly business standpoint, it wasn’t a bad idea, only Russo’s plan probably would have led to all-out war, and Granata wouldn’t go along with it. Russo decided to take over the family and impose his union anyway. He tried to hit Granata. He missed. Now a hundred and fifty Bonanno soldiers are searching for him, plus God knows how many freelancers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not complicated at all,” I told Roseanne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is if Russo cut a deal with the FBI. You say he’s in Minnesota?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was the last time I saw him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saw him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I stood about two yards away from him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last Friday afternoon. The day before he killed my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He killed your friend, but the FBI’s still protecting him?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-66.html","bookId":2224,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM"}
