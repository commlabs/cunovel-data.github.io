Lan finally came out of the pain. Fortunately, the majority of the pain occurred in her mind and not her physical body. So although she was still feeling a little headache, it was not life threatening. Seemed like there were different types of unlocked modes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan recovered but the two of them didn\u0027t separate. Zheng didn\u0027t know what his real feelings were. It took a while before he left Lan\u0027s lips. Her face was red by then, perhaps due to the pain or perhaps due to her shyness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng coughed a few times then laughed. \"Hehe. You better now? You seemed to be in a pretty bad condition. Is it because you unlocked your constraint?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan said with surprise. \"That state of mind is the unlocked mode? I don\u0027t know. I felt like my hands moved following my instincts when I concentrated on picking out the shrapnels from your back. My hands knew where the knife should go and how much strength I should use. I also condensed my psyche scan to a very small area. I could see and feel every inch of your body.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng subconsciously looked down. This little action made Lan blushed again. He immediately said. \"Hoho. Good. It\u0027s a good thing that you unlocked your constraint. Though don\u0027t unlock it again within these two days if you don\u0027t have to. Your DNA might fall apart if you use it too frequently in the beginning. Then you will die if you can\u0027t get back to God\u0027s dimension in time. So promise me don\u0027t unlock it if you can.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan nodded obediently. Zheng then handed her the bandage. \"Help me bandage up first. Hm? Someone contacted me just then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng turned on the device. Strangely, all he could heard were crackling sounds. It took him quite a while to make out these sounds were that of woods burning. No one answered on the other side. In other words, the device was dropped into a fire. Then those two women were probably...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng felt a sudden chill. He remembered he was constantly getting put in danger since he entered this movie. If it wasn\u0027t for his enhancements and the unlocked mode that provided him with a strong sixth sense against danger, he might have been killed by the accidents. The first attack from electricity was enough to kill any normal person. He survived the following attacks with both luck and strength. Unless Death didn\u0027t attack the two women, they wouldn\u0027t be able to survive one attack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng sighed. \"All the newbies died. Everyone from the bus aside from me died.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan felt a chill and immediately said. \"Don\u0027t say such negative words. Aren\u0027t you still doing well? Don\u0027t worry. We just have to defeat Jie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng shook his head with a bitter smile. \"It\u0027s difficult. Jie is stronger than we thought. And there\u0027s Yinkong, Heng, and Honglu. It\u0027s difficult to defeat them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan leaned on his side. \"Don\u0027t worry. I will always help you. There\u0027s got to be a way to defeat Jie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng massaged his temples. He began to ponder how he should solve the current situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lan, I have a way to go straight to Jie but you will have to take most of the risk. You might encounter great danger.\" Zheng said in a serious tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded and said. \"No problem. I can\u0027t have you be the one taking all the risks. Let me join the fight! Please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Still remember the training? It was also the two of us against the four of them. Now we only have to defeat Jie. So we can totally ignore the other three. The mission is over if I can get to him. So, my plan is...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ZhuWen finally waited for the police to arrive. Even the cops felt a chill when they saw the human charcoal. Everyone would be when you imagine a person was burned alive. So it took quite some time before they came to question her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, without any forms of identification, green card, address, or even documents of enter the border, ZhuWen was marked as an illegal immigrant. She was put into a police car and headed to the station.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cops didn\u0027t treat her too badly. One, no man would bear to treat a beautiful woman bad. Two, the informants said she had relationship with the boss of the new rising mafia gang.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So one cop took her back while the others stayed at the scene of fire to maintain order and possibly find the source of fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This cop was a middle age man. He didn\u0027t talk and just turned on the radio after he closed the car windows. The rock and roll music gave him a sense of satisfaction. He drove on as he continuously waved his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ZhuWen was feeling more and more horrible. Both for Lilin\u0027s death and also the situation she was in. She could see horrifying figures coming at her. This feeling was so scary, like she might dead at the next second. The feeling felt intense as the car drove on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cop was still waving his head as he sped passed several cars until he came up to a truck carrying bamboos. The truck was too big for him to drive pass. He honked it impatiently. The truck acted like it wanted to let the police car pass as it drove left and right. However, due to the truck\u0027s size and the narrow street, the police car had no choice but to follow behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The feeling of death had reached a height for ZhuWen. She kept knocking on the little window between the back and the driver\u0027s seat. But the music drowned out all the noise. The cop continued driving behind the truck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of the ropes that tied the bamboos in place snapped, then another one. The bamboos were getting loose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the same time, ZhuWen was knocking louder and louder. The cop finally noticed it. He immediately opened the little window and asked without turning around. \"What\u0027s wrong? Not feeling well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One stick of bamboo slid off the truck and pierced through the car window then went straight at the little window. ZhuWen just moved her head over to speak but the bamboo entered her mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng suddenly sat up. He looked around the park he and Lan had been staying in but there was no danger. The nearest building was also a hundred meters away. There shouldn\u0027t be anything here that Death could make use of.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng\u0027s body was full of injuries after the fight then the explosion yesterday. The injuries were too much even for the vampire bloodline. So he found this park to take a night of rest after eating some fast food. Though he was the only one resting. Lan had to continue scanning the television building throughout the night. He could only rest without worrying while she was using the scan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A slimmer of light appeared across the horizon. Zheng moved around a bit. It was only a night of rest and most injuries were healed, even the arrow hit on his shoulder was almost done healing. He was waiting for the sun to come up then he would charge at the building directly. He planned to give Jie a beating!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not going to sleep a bit? Let me take guard.\" Zheng sat next to Lan and said with sympathy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan laughed. \"Hehe. No problem. We should be able to go back today. Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027ve been protecting me the whole time. It actually doesn\u0027t feel bad to protect you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng was quiet. He looked up at the sky. The appearance of Venus signified the beginning of a new day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you still remember that training? Jie, wait for me!\" \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-8-chapter-3-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-8-chapter-4-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-8-chapter-4-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
