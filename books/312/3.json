Dunyazade\u0027s story begins in the middle; in the middle of my own, I can\u0027t conclude it -- but it must end in the night that all good mornings come to. The Arab storytellers understood this; they ended their stories not \"happily ever after,\" but specifically \"until there took them the Destroyer of Delights and Desolator of Dwelling-places, and they were translated to the ruth of Almighty Allah, and their houses fell waste and their palaces lay in ruins, and the Kings inherited their riches.\" And no man knows it better than Shah Zaman, to whom therefore the second half of his life will be sweeter than the first.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; To be joyous in the full acceptance of this d√©nouement is surely to possess a treasure, the key to which is the understanding that Key and Treasure are the same. There (with a kiss, little sister) is the sense of our story, Dunyazade: The key to the treasure is the treasure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/349/220.html","bookId":312,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:22:04 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:22:04 AM"}
