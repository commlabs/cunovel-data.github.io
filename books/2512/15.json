{"id":108147,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eMore hours pass. Joel lies sleeping. Once again I sit silently on the floor, my legs crossed, my eyes closed. Yet this time my attention is turned outward. Through the wall, I can just hear the guards at the security station talk. There are three of them now. They discuss a football game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those Forty-Niners are amazing,\" Guard One says. \"Their offense works like a machine gun--it just keeps firing. I felt sorry for the Cowboys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, everybody looks at the quarterback,\" Guard Two says. \"But I think when you got the receivers, you got all you need: Even a lousy pro quarterback can look good throwing to players who are wide open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s the other way around,\" Guard Three says. \"You got a great quarterback, he can hit a player who\u0027s totally covered. Not many teams win the Super Bowl with an average quarterback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not many teams win the Super Bowl, period,\" Guard One says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only one a year,\" Guard Two says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t be a Super Bowl if everyone could win it,\" Guard Three says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond their chattering, I sense their thoughts. The gift of Yaksha\u0027s blood grows stronger the more still I become. Guard One is contemplating his sour stom?ach. He has an ulcer, and when he pulls an all-night shift, it always hurts. He wonders if he should go to his car on the next break and get his bottle of Maalox. But he needs to drink it in private. The other guys always kid him about having a stomachache like a little kid. Actually, Guard One has a lot of guts going into work in the pain he\u0027s in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuard Two\u0027s thoughts are dull. He is thinking about his wife, his current mistress, and a woman he just met in the cafeteria two hours earlier--all of them naked together in bed with him. He drank a large Coke before starting his last shift. He has to pee real bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuard Three is interesting. Unknown to his bud?dies, he writes science-fiction in his spare time. His brother-in-law, who\u0027s a lawyer, just read his last book and told him to forget about becoming a writer. But Guard Three thinks that just because his brother-in-law has a law degree, it doesn\u0027t mean he can spot talent. And he\u0027s right--Guard Three\u0027s mind is rich in creative ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to concentrate hard to sense their thoughts. I can only read one at a time. Since ancient times I have been able to influence people\u0027s thoughts by staring hard at them and whispering suggestions in their ears. But in here I am deprived of the power of my gaze, of the soothing allure of my velvety voice. Yet the longer I concentrate on these guys, the more certain I am that I can introduce thoughts into their minds. I focus in on Guard Three--he\u0027s the most sensitive. Creating a strong image in my mind, I send it through the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This girl is real dangerous. She can kill us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuard Three is saying something that he suddenly breaks off in midsentence. I hear him shift uneasily in his chair. \"Hey, guys,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the other two ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That chick in there is dangerous. We have to be careful with her. You saw what she did to Sam and Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knocked them out cold,\" Guard Two agrees. \"But I\u0027d like to see her try it on me. She wouldn\u0027t get far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you want to mess with her,\" Guard One says. \"She\u0027s supposed to be super strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but they don\u0027t tell us why she\u0027s strong,\" Guard Three says. \"They just tell us to watch her. But what if she gets out? She could kill us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I whisper softly to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" Guard One says. \"There\u0027s no way she\u0027s getting out of that box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if she does break out,\" Guard Two says. \"We can stop her. I don\u0027t care about orders, I\u0027m opening fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear bullets can\u0027t stop her,\" Guard Three says, continuing to dwell on how dangerous I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift my focus to Guard One and send out another suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We mustn\u0027t lose sight of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll keep an eye on her,\" Guard One says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place the same thought in Guard Three\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Guard Three echoes, \"We have to be alert, keep watching her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to put the thought in Guard Two\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to take a piss,\" Guard Two says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well,\" I whisper to myself. \"Two out of three ain\u0027t bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next thirty minutes--pausing only when Guard Two goes to the bathroom--I steadily build up their paranoia about how dangerous I am and how bad things will be if they don\u0027t keep me under constant surveillance. Pretty soon Guards One and Three are talking paranoid gibberish. Guard Two is not sure how to calm them down, or even why they need to be calmed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we don\u0027t watch her every second,\" Guard One says. \"She\u0027ll escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she escapes,\" Guard Three says. \"She\u0027ll rip our hearts out and eat them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" Guard Two yells. \"She\u0027s not going to es?cape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that,\" Guard One says. \"If we don\u0027t blink, if we keep the lights on her, she won\u0027t escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if the lights go out, we\u0027re doomed,\" Guard Three says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would the lights go out?\" Guard Two wants to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a few deep breaths, I slowly ease out of my deep state of concentration. I reach over and gently shake Joel. He opens his eyes and smiles at me. In all the confusion I have forgotten how handsome he is. His dark blue eyes are filled with affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a pleasant sight to wake up to,\" he whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over and whisper directly into his ear. \"No. I\u0027ve been planting the seeds of our escape. The guards outside are now terrified of losing sight of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s curious. \"You know this for a fact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m going to break the lights in here, which will cause them to panic and call for help. I\u0027m sure General Havor himself will come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a plan of sorts, but it\u0027s not set in stone. Just follow my lead. Get up--get ready to act when I say the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel moves to the wall closest to the door. Standing in the center of the cell, staring at the overhead cameras, I give the guards on the other side of the wall one last thing to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming for you now,\" I say in a wicked voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better run, you\u0027d better hide.\" I lick my lips. \"Because I\u0027m very hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, in a series of blindingly fast moves, I shatter every light on the ceiling and plunge the cell into darkness. I see perfectly, but Joel has to reach for the wall to get his bearings. At the security station, I hear Guard One and Guard Three screaming in terror. Guard Two fumbles for his weapon, yelling at his partners to stop. I suppress a giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to me, General,\" I whisper. \"Come, Arturo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later I hear Arturo and Havor pound?ing down the narrow hall, speaking heatedly. Al?though I have not heard the general\u0027s voice before, I recognize it by the authority it commands. Arturo has influence within the confines of the compound, but the man with the star on his shoulder is in charge. I wonder about the details of their relationship. All about them, clutching machine guns and trying not to panic, are dozens of soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not a danger as long as we keep the lock in place,\" Arturo says to the general. \"This is a stunt she\u0027s pulling to get us to open the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it that we can\u0027t see her,\" General Havor snaps back. \"You heard what she told you. We don\u0027t know the full extent of her powers. For all we know she\u0027s cutting through a wall of the cell as we talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a master of manipulation,\" Arturo counters. \"She talked about her unknown powers to plant a seed of doubt in our minds--for just this occasion. If you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;open the door to check on her, she\u0027ll be on you in a second. You\u0027ll have to kill her to stop her and you can\u0027t kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll wait and see what she does next,\" General Havor says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Joel hisses in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper softly so that only he can hear. \"The general and Arturo are coming. They don\u0027t want to open the door, but I think I can do something to inspire them to relent. There will be a lot of noise in a few minutes. Besides creating the racket, I will be mentally projecting into the general\u0027s mind. Please don\u0027t speak to me during this time. I need to concen?trate. Then, when they start to open the door, I need you to wedge yourself in the corner behind the door. But don\u0027t do it until I give the signal. There\u0027ll be gunfire, and the space behind the door will be the safest. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You really think they\u0027ll open the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ll make them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more I sit cross-legged on the floor, this time in the center of the room. Quieting my thoughts with several deep breaths, I project myself into the gener?al\u0027s mind. It is easy to locate--the psychic energy that emanates from him is like molten lava from an erupting volcano. Yet his resolve will not be so easily manipulated with a few implanted thoughts. With a strong individual, even when I can look him in the eye and whisper in his ear, I have trouble getting him to do what I want. Now, I have neither of those options at my disposal. What I am attempting to do is set up several conditions that will work on the general and prompt him to give the order to open the door. Getting the guards nervous and knocking out the lights were the first of my conditional steps. The next ones will be more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slip into General Haver\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a black cavern, draped with the webs of poisonous spiders. When he does get my power, I see, General Havor fantasizes about raping me. He also plans to kill Arturo, as soon as the alchemist com?pletes his experiments. There is no trust between the two. General Havor fears Arturo will alter his own DNA and then kill the general. But what Arturo thinks I cannot read. His mind is heavily cloaked-- not unexpected in a partial hybrid. Anyway, I must concentrate on the man who gives the orders. General Havor must push the button that opens the door--?this is all that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach out with my mental claw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The witch will break down the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the general speak to Arturo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you positive she cannot break down the door?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even she cannot destroy this alloy,\" Arturo reas?sures him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood of a dead witch is as good as the blood of a living witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Havor does not speak this thought aloud to Arturo. But I know he fantasizes about shooting me in the head, killing me, and immediately injecting my blood into his veins. It is an attractive idea to him;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArturo will not be able to stop him, or to come back at him later at an unexpected time, with an unseen dagger in his hand. It is this latter point that is the general\u0027s primary worry. My suggestion hits home, and I watch as my mental implant expands and warps. General Havor can almost feel what it will be like to have my blood flow through his veins in the next few minutes. I give the idea another nudge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wait for the witch\u0027s blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, General Havor does not share this idea aloud with Arturo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he is not ready to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStretching and breathing normally, I slowly come out of my trance. Enough for mental gymnastics. It is time for brutal force. Climbing to my feet, I study the supposedly impenetrable door, then launch my at?tack. I leap into the air and plant three extremely powerful kicks on the hard metal with my feet. In quick succession I leap again and again, alternately pounding the door with first my right then my left foot. The door doesn\u0027t give, but the noise I create is deafening. Outside I can hear them shouting to one another, and I know what the general is thinking. The witch is going to break out. I may as well open the door and kill her while I have her cornered. To hell with Arturo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep up the pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, I am sure, Guard One and Guard Three have wet their pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter five minutes, I pause. Something is happen?ing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strain to listen with my ears. General Havor and Arturo are arguing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are playing right into her hands!\" Arturo yells. \"The only protection we have from her is this cell. Open it and you open the door to death--both for yourself and your men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do you think that door can withstand that barrage?\" General Havor asks. \"See, there are cracks in the walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cracks are in the walls that hold the metal cage! The cage itself shows no sign of giving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it!\" General Havor snaps. \"I say we face her now when we\u0027re armed and ready. Better she die than escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about her blood? We need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be plenty of her blood lying around when I finish with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArturo hesitates. He lowers his voice. \"Plenty of blood for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Havor does not answer. He knows there will be only enough blood left in my body for him to inject into his own veins. The more I listen to the two, the clearer it becomes that General Havor is not interested in Arturo\u0027s hybrid. He wants to be a full fledged vampire. That\u0027s where it\u0027s at in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI return to my pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet ache. It doesn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise shakes the whole building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagine even the men in the perimeter towers are trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the door, the guards shout to their general for orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Havor and Arturo continue to argue. I hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will die!\" Arturo screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s only one!\" General Havor yells. \"She can\u0027t get us all!\" He pauses, makes a decision, and shouts to his men. \"Stand ready! We\u0027re going in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relax for a moment and catch my breath. \"They\u0027re coming,\" I whisper to Joel. \"Get behind the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t I help?\" he asks, moving. \"I am a vampire, after all. Not just FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle softly. \"Later, Joel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, I hear what sounds like a platoon of guards gathering around the red button. Each is more than a little reluctant to push it. The heavy metal door has become awfully comforting. But the general is shout?ing at them again to open it. Loaded magazines are popped onto Ml6s. Bullets are locked into firing chambers. Rifles are shouldered. I can smell the sweat of their fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody gathers the courage to push the button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door begins to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leap up and into a corner near the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t need to use my newfound levitating abilities. I am able to wedge myself against the ceiling by pressing the back of my neck against one corner wall, and my feet against the other. Supernatural strength has its advantages. I leave my arms free--I am a black widow ready to swoop down and snatch her prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are going to rue the day they decided to lock me in a solid metal cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear them outside in the hall. Their frightened breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could hear a pin drop. Even without vampire ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not there,\" someone whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey aren\u0027t even worried about Joel. Just me, that damn witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s behind the door,\" General Havor snarls from farther down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s good to know exactly where he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do?\" someone croaks. Sounds like Guard Three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going in there,\" Guard One moans. His ulcer must be killing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this,\" Guard Two agrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door will not close again, no matter what happens. I will not let it. But now I am faced with a decision to make. There is only one hostage who will get me to where I want to go, and that is the kind-hearted General Havor. If I abduct Arturo, the gener?al will tell his men to open fire on both of us. Certainly, any guard I would grab would be expend?able in the general\u0027s mind. Friendly fire, they call it. Yet the general is maybe fifty feet up the hall. Between us are many soldiers. I am going to have to reduce the numbers. I need the men to panic and flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I will have to cause pain to make that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a move too swift for the soldiers to see, I slide onto the top of the door, reach outside the cage, grab one of the soldiers by the hair, and pull him back up into the corner with me. The man screams in my hands and I let him carry on for a bit. No doubt he feels like a victim in an Alien movie. Because he is crying so loudly, it takes me several seconds to recognize his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is Guard Three--the one who writes science-fiction in his spare time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sure he has seen all the Alien movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take his weapon and put my hand over his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" I whisper. \"Things are not so bad as they seem. I am not going to kill you, not if you cooperate. I know about you and I like you. The problem is, I need to scare your friends out there. Now I know they are already pretty spooked, but I\u0027ve got to get them to the point where they want to flee, no matter what your general orders. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, his eyes ready to burst out of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. \"That\u0027s good. They are probably imagining that I am ripping your heart out right now. And with a little help from you, I can make them think that is exactly what I am doing. I will hardly have to hurt you at all. Oh, I see you notice I use the word hurt. To be honest, I will have to cut you enough so that I can blow the stream of your warm blood out into the hall. Splashing blood always creates a wonderful effect, especially when vampires are involved. While I do that, I want you to scream bloody murder. Can you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinch him. \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he croaks. \"I don\u0027t want to die, I have a wife and two kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, and your brother-in-law is a lawyer. By the way, don\u0027t listen to a thing he tells you. He is like all lawyers--envious of those who do honest work for a living. You just keep writing your stories. If you want, you can even write one about me. But make me a blond--this red hair is store-bought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" he asks, relaxing slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want him too relaxed. \"I am Mrs. Satan.\" I scratch him on the inside of his right arm, tearing his flesh and drawing plenty of blood. \"Start screaming, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuard Three does as he\u0027s told. His performance is admirable--he believes half of it. \"Oh God! Stop it! Save me. Shefs ripping my heart out!\" Actually, he didn\u0027t have to get so specific, but I let it pass. While he cries to his fellow soldiers, I purse my lips and blow on the blood that trickles from his arm. I have quite the set of lungs. The blood splatters over the exterior of the wall, and onto the floor outside. I hear the men moaning in horror. This is worse than \u0027Nam, many think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey haven\u0027t seen anything yet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now let out a real loud death scream,\" I tell Guard Three, \"Trail off into silence. Then, I\u0027ll drop you behind the door where my friend is hiding. You might want to stay there when the shooting starts. I warn you ahead of time, I am going to have to kill many of your friends. When I am through, you may leave this building. Get out as fast as you can. Steal a truck if you have to. Things are going to get awfully hot here. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You\u0027re not going to kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not tonight. You can relax, after you do exactly what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard lets out the death scream. I spray an especially wide shower of blood through the doorway. Then I drop the guy down beside Joel, who pats him on the back and tells him to relax. I hand Joel the man\u0027s weapon and order him to keep it handy. Several guards outside the door are crying. They have backed away, but not far enough to be safe. I reach out and grab another. He carries a high-powered machine gun, which I wedge between the door and frame. He smells of hamburger and fries. His food is probably not digesting well. I don\u0027t know this soldier, which doesn\u0027t bode well for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\"You\u0027re going to die now,\" I tell his horrified face. \"I am sorry it has to be this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kill him slowly, painfully, so that his throat-tearing screams and red blood mingle to create an image so ghastly that many of the soldiers feel they are trapped in a nightmare from which they cannot awaken. When I am done, I throw what is left of his body into the hall. It is very messy--the terror in the air is as palpable as the hard metal door that can no longer be closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis last execution has disturbed me. If I am forced to kill, I prefer to do so efficiently and painlessly. I will not make another example--I don\u0027t have the stomach for it. It is time to leave the building, with Joel and General Havor in hand. To grab the machine gun the soldier brought in, I drop from my position on the ceiling and immediately retrieve it and open fire. The men outside the door stand frozen in place. They fall to their deaths like tenpins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kill eight of them before I step into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArturo and General Havor are at the far end. They are a hundred feet away and backing up fast. Between us there are many soldiers. I cannot allow the big boss to leave the building without me. But the bloody examples I made of the first two men have had an effect. The soldiers are pushing and crowding behind General Havor and Arturo, slowing them down, pre?venting them from simply leaving. Also, General Havor has lost control of his men. I stand a clear and easy target in the hallway, but no order to fire comes. In their hearts, the men do not believe this witch can be killed with mere bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wish they hadn\u0027t opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop your weapons and I will let you live!\" I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost in front of me surrender right then. The few who don\u0027t, who take aim, I shoot in the head. The sheer number of deaths does not numb me. I look in the eyes of each one I destroy, and wonder about his life and who he leaves behind. If it was just my life--honestly, if there was no danger of my blood falling into the wrong hands, I would let them cut me down. But I have a responsibility to mankind. I know that is the rationale of every great man or woman, of every merciless monster. The smell of Wood is too thick even for my taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArturo and General Havor disappear around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI call to Joel to join me in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cautiously peeks out. He groans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing can be worth than this,\" he whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may be right,\" I say. \"Still, we have to get out of here. To do that, we need General Havor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the second floor.\" I grab Joel with my free arm and shield the top of his head with my palm. \"Let\u0027s join him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leap straight up and smash through the ceiling. Again, Yaksha\u0027s blood comes to my aid. Without it, such a move would have given me a righteous head?ache. This time the ceiling barely slows me down. Pulling Joel through the hole I have created, we stand up on the floor of the basement, level one. I see soldiers down the hall jamming the stairs, frantic to exit. Arturo and General Havor struggle in the midst of the human flood. Raising the machine gun to my shoulder, I take aim at General Havor\u0027s right thigh. For a split second it is dearly visible. I put a bullet in it. The general stumbles and lets out a cry. No one stops to help him, least of all Arturo. I grab Joel\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I wade into the crowd, they scream and scatter. I guess my red hair does not suit me. Or perhaps it is the fact that I am soaked from head to toe in blood. I must look like a beast that has climbed from the depths of hell. Arturo is already out of sight, but General Havor lies helpless at the side of the stairway. He is lucky that he-was not trampled to death. But he is not lucky that it is me who reaches out to help him to his feet. \"General Havor,\" I say. \"Pleased to meet you face to face. Sorry I have to ask a favor so soon after saying hello. But I need you to take me and my friend into the cave behind this compound. I need one of those thermonuclear warheads you keep there. I have a thing about fire, you see, about explosions. For me, the bigger the better.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-dice-the-last-vampire-3/page-15.html","bookId":2512,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM"}
