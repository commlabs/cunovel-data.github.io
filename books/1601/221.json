He was reasonably certain they’d been fighting for four or five hours now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think they’ll stop for the night?\" Golever asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doubtful\", Galad said. \"If this battle lasts that long\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolever looked at him with concern. \"You think—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot follow what is happening. Cauthon sent so many troops up here, and he pulled everyone off the Heights, from what I can tell. I don’t know why. And the water in the river . . . does it seem to be flowing in fits and spurts to you? The struggle upstream must be going poorly . . \". He shook his head. \"Perhaps if I could see more of the battlefield, I could understand Cauthon’s plan\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a soldier. A soldier need not understand the whole of the battle in order to follow his orders. However, Galad was usually able to at least piece together his side’s strategy from commands given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever imagined a battle this large?\" Golever asked, turning his head. Arganda’s infantry was crashing into the Trollocs at the river. More and more of the Shadowspawn were getting across—with alarm, Galad realized that the river had stopped flowing completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadowspawn had gotten a footing in the last hour. It was going to be a tough fight, but at least the numbers were more even now, with all the Trollocs they had killed earlier. Cauthon had known the river would stop flowing. That was why he’d sent so many troops up here, to stem this onslaught from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, Galad thought, I’m watching the Game of Houses on the battlefield itself Yes, he had not given Cauthon nearly enough credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lead ball with a red streamer suddenly fell from the sky about twenty paces ahead, hitting a dead Trolloc in the skull. Far overhead, the raken screeched and continued on its way. Galad heeled Sidama forward, and Golever climbed down to fetch the letter for him. Gateways were useful, but raken could see the battlefield in its expanse, search out banners for specific men and deliver orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolever handed him the letter, and Galad pulled his list of ciphers from the leather envelope he carried in the top of his boot. The ciphers were simple—a list of numbers with words beside them. If orders didn’t use the right word and the right number together, then they were suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamodred, the orders read, bring yourself and a dozen of the best men from your twenty-second company and move along the river toward Hawal Ford. Stop when you can see Elayne’s banner and hold there for more orders. P. S. If you see any Trollocs with quarterstaffs, I suggest you let Golever fight them instead, as I know you have trouble with those types. Mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalad sighed, showing the letter to Golever. The cipher authenticated it; the number twenty-two and the word \"quarterstaff\" were paired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he want of us?\" Golever asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I knew\", Galad said. He really did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll gather some men\", Golever said. \"I assume you’ll want Harnesh, Mallone, Brokel . . \". He continued through an entire list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalad nodded. \"A good list. Well, I can’t say I’m sad for this order. My sister has entered the field, it appears. I would keep watch on her\". Beyond that, he wanted to look over another section of the battlefield. Perhaps that would help him understand what Cauthon was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you order, Lord Captain Commander\", Golever said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an attempt to tear Rand apart, to destroy him bit by bit. The Dark One sought to claim the very elements that made up Rand’s essence, then annihilate them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand couldn’t gasp, couldn’t cry out. This attack wasn’t at his body, for he had no true body in this place, just a memory of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand held himself together. With difficulty. In the face of this awesome attack, any notion of defeating the Dark One—of killing him—vanished. Rand couldn’t defeat anything. He could barely hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not have described the sensation if he’d tried. It was as if the Dark One was shredding him while at the same time trying to crush him entirely, coming at Rand from infinite directions, all at once, in a wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand fell to his knees. It was a projection of himself that did so, but it felt real to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eternity passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand suffered it. The crushing pressure, the noise of destruction. He weathered it on his knees, fingers taut like claws, sweat streaming from his brow. He suffered it and looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is all you have?\" Rand growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WILL WIN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made me strong\", Rand said, voice ragged. \"Each time you or your minions tried to destroy me, your failure was like the blacksmith’s hammer beating against metal. This attempt . . \". Rand took a deep breath. \"This attempt of yours is nothing. I will not break\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU MISTAKE. THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY YOU. THIS IS PREPARATION.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO SHOW YOU TRUTH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFragments of the Pattern . . . threads . . . suddenly spun before Rand, splitting from the main body of light like hundreds of tiny flowing streams. He knew this was not actually the Pattern, no more than what he saw as himself was actually his body. In interpreting something so vast as the fabric of creation, his mind needed some kind of imagery. This was what his consciousness chose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threads spun, not unlike threads in a weave of the One Power, only there were thousands upon thousands of them, and the colors were more varied, more vibrant. Each was straight, like a string pulled taut. Or a beam of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came together like the product of a loom, creating a vision around him. A ground of slimy soil, plants speckled with black, trees with limbs that drooped like arms bereft of strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became a place. A reality. Rand pushed himself to his feet, and could feel the soil. He could smell smoke in the air. Could hear . . . moans of sorrow. Rand turned, and found that he was on a mostly barren slope above a dark city with black stone walls. Buildings huddled inside, squat and dull, like bunkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this?\" Rand whispered. Something about the place felt familiar. He looked up, but could not see the sun for the clouds that dominated the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT IS WHAT WILL BE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand felt for the One Power, but drew back in revulsion. The taint had returned, but it was worse—far worse. Where it had once been a dark film on the molten light of saidin, it was now a sludge so thick that he could not pierce it. He would have to drink in the darkness, envelop himself in it, to seek out the One Power beneath—if, indeed, it was even still there. The mere thought made bile rise in his throat, and he had to fight to keep h \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-221.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
