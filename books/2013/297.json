These foreigners were making a point of killing Tiste Edur. So, although Letherii soldiers were assembling to march west against the invaders, the Chancellor had prepared secret instructions to the commanders. He could see a way through all of this. For the Letherii, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Have you readied your gear, Sirryn?’ he asked as they approached the throne room doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ the soldier said bemusedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I need someone I can rely on with the armies, Sirryn, and that someone is you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Chancellor!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust convey my words to the letter, idiot. ‘Fail me, Sirryn, and do not bother coming back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Understood, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Get the doors.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirryn rushed ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the throne room was an unexpected, unwelcome surprise. Crouched in a desultory heap of twisted bone and mangled flesh was Hannan Mosag and four of his K’risnan. As emblems of the foul sorcery feeding these Edur, there could be no better image to burn its bitter way into the Chancellor’s brain. His father would have appreciated the scene, would indeed have gathered huge chunks of marble from which he would hack out life-sized likenesses, as if in mimicking reality he could somehow discover what lay beneath it, the turgid currents of soul. A waste of time, as far as Triban Gnol was concerned. Besides, some things should never be revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannan Mosag’s deformed face seemed to leer at the Chancellor as he strode past the Ceda and his four Tiste Edur warlocks, but there was fear in the Ceda’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSword-tip skittering on the cracked, scarred and gouged tiles, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths shifted uneasily on his throne. ‘Chancellor,’ Rhulad rasped, ‘how good of you to come. And Letherii mages, a most impressive if useless gathering.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol bowed, then said, ‘Allied with Hannan Mosag’s formidable Cedance, sire, our sorcerous prowess should be more than sufficient to rid ourselves of these foreign interlopers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoins clicked on Rhulad’s face as he grimaced. ‘And the mages of the Borthen Brigade, were they sufficient? What of the Brigade itself, Chancellor? They have been mauled! Letherii mages, Letherii soldiers! Tiste Edur! Your foreign interlopers are carving through a damned army!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unanticipated,’ Triban Gnol murmured, eyes downcast, ‘that the imperial fleets in their search for champions should have so riled a distant empire. As to that empire’s belligerence, well, it seems almost unmatched; indeed, virtually insane, given the distances spanned to prosecute vengeance. Odd, as well, that no formal declaration of war was received-although, of course, it is doubtful our fleets ventured the same preceding the slaughter of that empire’s citizens. Perhaps,’ he added, glancing up, ‘negotiation remains possible. Some form of financial compensation, should we prove able to arrange a truce-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHacking laughter from Hannan Mosag. ‘You provincial fool, Gnol. Would that you were even capable of expanding that puny, melodramatic theatre of your mind, then mayhap humility would still that flapping tongue of yours.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrows raised, the Chancellor half turned to regard the Ceda. ‘And what secret knowledge of this enemy do you possess? And would you care to enlighten myself and your Emperor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This is not punitive,’ Hannan Mosag said. ‘Although it might seem that way. Empires get their noses bloodied all the time, and there were enough clashes at sea to deliver the message that this Malazan Empire was not to be trifled with. Our fleets were sent scurrying from their waters-Hanradi Khalag was brutally honest in his assessment. Malazan mages are more than a match for us, and for the Letherii.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If not punitive,’ Triban Gnol asked, ‘then what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannan Mosag faced the Emperor. ‘Sire, my answer is best reserved for you alone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad bared his teeth. ‘I am not deceived by your games, Ceda. Speak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sire-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Answer him!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I must not!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence, in which Triban Gnol could hear naught but his own heart, thudding hard against his ribs. Hannan Mosag had made a terrible mistake here, victim of his own self-importance. Seeking to use this information of his as a means to crawl back to the Emperor’s side. But the effort… so clumsy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell me,’ Rhulad said in a whisper, ‘why this must be our secret.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sire, this matter belongs among the Tiste Edur.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh. Because, dear Emperor, these Mahxzans, they are coining for you. Triban Gnol cleared his throat and clasped his hands together above his robe’s belt. ‘This is unnecessary,’ he said in his smoothest voice. ‘I am not so provincial as Hannan Mosag would like to believe. Emperor, your fleets set out across the world in search of champions, and so indeed they have gathered the best, most capable fighters from a host of peoples. What they could not have anticipated is that an entire empire would proclaim itself a champion. And set itself against you, sire. Our reports have made it clear,’ he added, ‘that the enemy is converging on Letheras, on this very city.’ He regarded Hannan Mosag as he added, ‘They are-and yes, Ceda, I see the truth plain on your face-they are coming for the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths. Alas, I do not expect they will elect to challenge him one soldier at a time.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-297.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
