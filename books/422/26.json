How the Princes rode to the Land of the Huns","content":"\u0026nbsp;So then of their doings in Hunland needeth no more to say: \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But for them of Burgundia—never such high-souled heroes as they\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rode in such lordly fashion in the land of any king.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All had they, weapons and raiment, that they would for their wayfaring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Lord of the Rhine in vesture arrayed his warrior-throng,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Knights fourscore and a thousand, as sayeth the olden song;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea also, and squires nine thousand to that great feast-tide rode.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —They were sorely bewept thereafter by them that at home abode.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At Worms through the palace-courtyard armour they bare and attire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he watched, a word of boding spake the ancient bishop of Speyer\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Queen Uta the lovely: “Our friends be minded to fare\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To be guests in a far-off country—God have them in his care!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Uta the noble Lady spake to her sons in her fear:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “O heroes mighty-hearted, I pray you, tarry here!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Last night came a dream of anguish mid the visions of mine head;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For meseemed in the land Burgundian that all her birds were dead.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Swiftly made answer Hagen: “Whoso regardeth a dream\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shall never wisely advise him; he shall never rightly deem\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 206}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a matter that toucheth his honour, or choose the better part!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now it behoveth my master to bid farewell and depart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Blithely will we ride onward into King Etzel’s land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There well to a king may service be done by a hero’s hand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There what manner of high-tide Kriemhild holds shall we see.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Hagen counselled the journey—cause to rue it had he!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nay, still had he spoken against it, were it not for the bitter jeer\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That Gernot had flung at the hero, when he said with scornful sneer:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The ghost of Siegfried standeth, of the Lady Kriemhild’s lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the path, and frighteth Hagen from journeying thitherward!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Hagen of Troneg: “Never fear stirreth nor stayeth me!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, ye have determined it, heroes: your hands to the work set ye.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Doubt not, I will ride with you blithely into King Etzel’s realm.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Soon hewn by him asunder was many a shield and helm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To bear them over the Rhine-flood ready the galleys lay;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the warriors set a-shipboard their goodly vesture-array:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With lading and unlading till eventide busy they were.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —O forth from their homes full blithely on the journey did they fare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The warriors pitched in the meadow for themselves pavilion and tent\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the other side the Rhine-flood, where that last night was spent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Tarry, O Gunther!” did Brunhild, his lovely wife, implore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As she clasped to her heart her husband that night, and never more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shrilled flutes and blared forth trumpets as the first of the dawn-light shone,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bidding them forth on the journey, and all made haste to be gone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lover in arms of lover was strained close, close to the heart,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They whom with anguish unending would the wife of Etzel part.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the sons of the fair Queen Uta had of their vassals a man\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bold and withal true-hearted: even as the journey began,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The thoughts of his heart he uttered to the King, for he drew him aside,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he said: “It grieveth me sorely that thou goest to this high-tide.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the name of the thane was Rumold, trusty of heart and hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Whom wilt thou leave as warden,” he said, “of thy folk and thy land?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 207}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Alas that none can turn you, O knights, from your enterprise!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never the message of Kriemhild was good in thy servant’s eyes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Unto thee be the land committed, and also my little son.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To our wives do loyal service: I will that so it be done.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whomsoever thou seest weeping, speak to them words of cheer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No hurt shall the wife of Etzel do us; have thou no fear.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Moreover the King took counsel, or ever they parted thence,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With all his chiefest liegemen: he left not bare of defence\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His kingdom and his castles: to keep them safe in ward\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He delivered them over to chosen barons, to watch and to guard.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All harnessed stood the horses for vassal and for king.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With loving kisses of parting did wives unto husbands cling\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In whose bosoms were hearts high-leaping, in whose veins was lusty life,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet for whom there was soon sore weeping of many a widowed wife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Now all the air was thrilling with weeping and wailing wild.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the King drew nigh Queen Brunhild; she bare in her arms their child:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How canst thou endure to leave us desolate both in a day?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For love of us,” said the woeful Queen, “ah, stay with us, stay!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) “My wife, it doth not beseem thee thus to be weeping for me;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rather in queenly courage fearless here shouldst thou be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With joy shall we soon be returning safe and sound again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In that same hour from their dear ones parted all his train.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now did those valiant warriors their steeds at last bestride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While many a loving woman stood watching tearful-eyed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Long, long shall be this parting!” their hearts were whispering still.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n None can be blithe of spirit in the shadow of coming ill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forward set the Burgundians, a battle-eager band.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thronged and pressed to behold them the people of the land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To right and to left on the hill-sides men and women wept;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But, how sorrowed the people soever, for joy their own hearts leapt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 208}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forth also with these went riding Niblung men of war,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A thousand heroes in hauberks: in the Niblung homes afar\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair women they left full many whom they saw not from that day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Rankled the wounds of Siegfried in the heart of Kriemhild aye!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Albeit the faith of Christians was weak in those far-off days,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet journeyed with these a chaplain for chanting of prayer and praise;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And, though out of desperate peril, alive this man came home;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But all the rest in the Hunland tarried, for death was their doom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Onward their way they wended far up the stream of Main,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And upward through Eastern Frankland, that armour-glittering line.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By Hagen still were they guided, for all the land knew he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Dankwart was their marshal, the hero of Burgundy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On through the land of the East-Franks, through Swanfeld are they gone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was like a procession of princes as the stately ranks swept on,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kings and their high-born kinsmen, heroes of world-sung fame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So at the twelfth day’s dawning the King to the Danube came.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There rode Hagen of Troneg afront of all the rest,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Right good at need as a helper, and a stay unto men distressed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the saddle that dauntless baron sprang by the river-side,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the bridle of his charger straightway to a tree hath he tied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In flood were the mighty waters, no boat might any see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then were the Niblung warriors in sore perplexity\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How they should win thereover, so broad was the rolling flood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Down lighted beside the river full many a warrior good.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Evil may well befall thee,” said Hagen, “in this place.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n See, Lord of Rhineland, the peril stareth thee in the face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Over-bank are the great flood-waters: too strong is their rush to essay:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Many good knights, if we tempt it, I ween, shall we lose this day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wherefore essay to daunt me, Hagen?” the proud King said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For the sake of thy knightly honour no more speak counsels of dread!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 209}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seek thou for a ford for our crossing over to yonder land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whereby our gear and our horses may be brought from strand to strand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not yet of my life so weary am I waxen,” Hagen replied,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That I were contented to drown me in yonder waters wide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Full many a warrior smitten by mine hands shall perish first\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the land of this King Etzel—yea, I am battle-athirst.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarry ye here by the water, ye thanes of knightly pride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Alone will I go, and for boatmen will I search by the river-side\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which unto the land of Gelfrat shall ferry us over the spate.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then took the aweless Hagen his strong shield, goodly and great.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well was he armed against foemen: his shield from his shoulders was slung,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he laced on his head his helmet, a splendour of fight far-flung:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Belted unto his corslet was a broad bright battle-glaive\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twin-edged, whose deadly keenness the shields of the mighty clave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Up-stream and down-stream casting for a ferry-wight sought he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then heard he a plashing of water, and hearkened where it should be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And lo, in a pool fair-welling did mermaids plunge and swim\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To cool in the dimpling river each summer-fevered limb.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Hagen was ware of the wise-wives, and stealthily nearer he crept.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They saw him, and swiftly flashing far off through the ripples leapt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Laughed they for glee, as fleers that mark a pursuer outrun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then seized he their raiment, but further scathe unto them did he none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then cried unto him a mermaiden, and Hadburg had she to name:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Behold, we will tell thee, Hagen, thou knight of peerless fame,—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So thou wilt restore our apparel in guerdon for our rede,—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How thou and thy friends in thy journey to the land of the Huns shall speed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They swayed on the swaying water as birds that rock on the sea:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he thought on their weird foreknowledge, on the eyes that pierce the To Be;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The gladlier therefore he trusted that their lips the truth would show;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And answer they made, when he questioned of the thing that he fain would know.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For Hadburg said: “Ye may safely to the land of Etzel ride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I pledge thee my faith in surety for that I have prophesied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p.
