At this moment, Leto found the majordomo a delight to observe. Moneo wore a white Atreides uniform with no insignia, a subtle comment. His face, almost as well known as Leto\u0027s, was all the insignia he needed. Moneo waited patiently. There was no change of expression on his flat, even features. His thick, sandy hair lay in a neat, equally divided part. Deep within his gray eyes there was that look of directness which went with knowledge of great personal power. It was a look which he modified only in the God Emperor\u0027s presence, and sometimes not even there. Not once did he glance toward the body on the crypt\u0027s floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Leto continued silent, Moneo cleared his throat, then: \"I am saddened, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExquisite! Leto thought. He knows l feel true remorse about the Duncans. Moneo has seen their records and has seen enough of them dead. He knows that only nineteen Duncans died what people usually refer to as natural deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had an Ixian lasgun,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo\u0027s gaze went directly to the gun on the floor of the crypt off to his left, demonstrating that he already had seen it. He returned his attention to Leto, sweeping a glance down the length of the great body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are injured, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inconsequential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those flippers are useless to me. They will be entirely gone within another two hundred years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will dispose of the Duncan\u0027s body personally, Lord,\" Moneo said. \"Is there...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The piece of me he burned away is entirely ash. We will let it blow away. This is a fitting place for ashes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As my Lord says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you dispose of the body, disable the lasgun and keep it where I can present it to the Ixian ambassador. As for the Guildsman who warned us about it, present him personally with ten grams of spice. Oh-and our priestesses on Giedi Prime should be alerted to a hidden store of melange there, probably old Harkonnen contraband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you wish done with it when it\u0027s found, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use a bit of it to pay the Tleilaxu for the new ghola. The rest of it can go into our stores here in the crypt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord.\" Moneo acknowledged the orders with a nod, a gesture which was not quite a bow. His gaze met Leto\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto smiled. He thought: We both know that Moneo will not leave without addressing directly the matter which most concerns us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen the report on Siona,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto\u0027s smile widened. Moneo was such a pleasure in these moments. His words conveyed many things which did not require open discussion between them. His words and actions were in precise alignment, carried on the mutual awareness that he, of course, spied on everything. Now, there was a natural concern for his daughter, but he wished it understood that his concern for the God Emperor remained paramount. From his own traverse through a similar evolution, Moneo knew with precision the delicate nature of Siona\u0027s present fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I not created her, Moneo?\" Leto asked. \"Have I not controlled the conditions of her ancestry and her upbringing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is my only daughter, my only child, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way, she reminds me of Harq al-Ada,\" Leto said. \"There doesn\u0027t appear to be much of Ghani in her, although that has to be there. Perhaps she harks back to our ancestors in the Sisterhood\u0027s breeding program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto reflected. Was there need for Moneo to know this peculiar thing about his daughter? Siona could fade from the prescient view at times. The Golden Path remained, but Siona faded. Yet...she was not prescient. She was a unique phenomenon... and if she survived... Leto decided he would not cloud Moneo\u0027s efficiency with unnecessary information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember your own past,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed, Lord! And she has such a potential, so much more than I ever had. But that makes her dangerous, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she will not listen to you,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I have an agent in her rebellion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat will be Topri, Leto thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt required no prescience to know that Moneo would have an agent in place. Ever since the death of Siona\u0027s mother, Leto had known with increasing sureness the course of Moneo\u0027s actions. Nayla\u0027s suspicions pinpointed Topri. And now, Moneo paraded his fears and actions, offering them as the price of his daughter\u0027s continued safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow unfortunate he fathered only the one child on that mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recall how I treated you in similar circumstances,\" Leto said. \"You know the demands of the Golden Path as well as I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was young and foolish, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young and brash, never foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo managed a tight smile at this compliment, his thoughts leaning more and more toward the belief that he now understood Leto\u0027s intentions. The dangers, though!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeding his belief, Leto said: \"You know how much I enjoy surprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is true, Leto thought. Moneo does know it. But even while Siona surprises me, she reminds me of what I fear most-the sameness and boredom which could break the Golden Path. Look at how boredom put me temporarily in the Duncan\u0027s power! Siona is the contrast by which I know my deepest fears. Moneo\u0027s concern for me is well grounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My agent will continue to watch her new companions, Lord,\" Moneo said. \"I do not like them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her companions? I myself had such companions once long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rebellious, Lord? You?\" Moneo was genuinely surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I not proved a friend of rebellion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Lord...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The aberrations of our past are more numerous than you may think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord.\" Moneo was abashed, yet still curious. And he knew that the God Emperor sometimes waxed loquacious after the death of a Duncan. \"You must have seen many rebellions, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvoluntarily, Leto\u0027s thoughts sank into the memories aroused by these words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, Moneo,\" he muttered. \"My travels in the ancestral mazes have memorized uncounted places and events which I never desire to see repeated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine your inward travels, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you cannot. I have seen peoples and planets in such numbers that they lose meaning even in imagination. Ohhh, the landscapes I have passed. The calligraphy of alien roads glimpsed from space and imprinted upon my innermost sight. The eroded sculpture of canyons and cliffs and galaxies has imprinted upon me the certain knowledge that I am a mote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you, Lord. Certainly not you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Less than a mote! I have seen people and their fruitless societies in such repetitive posturings that their nonsense fills me with boredom, do you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not mean to anger my Lord.\" Moneo spoke meekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t anger me. Sometimes you irritate me, that is the extent of it. You cannot imagine what I have seen-caliphs and mjeeds, rakahs, rajas and bashars, kings and emperors, primitos and presidents-I\u0027ve seen them all. Feudal chieftains, every one. Every one a little pharaoh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive my presumption, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn the Romans!\" Leto cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke it inwardly to his ancestors: \"Damn the Romans!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir laughter drove him from the inward arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand, Lord,\" Moneo ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true. You don\u0027t understand. The Romans broadcast the pharaonic disease like grain farmers scattering the seeds of next season\u0027s harvest -Caesars, kaisers, tsars, imperators, caseris... palatos... damned pharaohs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My knowledge does not encompass all of those titles, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may be the last of the lot, Moneo. Pray that this is so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever my Lord commands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto stared down at the man. \"We are myth-killers, you and I, Moneo. That\u0027s the dream we share. I assure you from a God\u0027s Olympian perch that government is a shared myth. When the myth dies, the government dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thus you have taught me, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man-machine, the Army, created our present dream, my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto recognized the small signs of the majordomo\u0027s impatience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo understands about armies. He knows it was a fool\u0027s dream that armies were the basic instrument of governance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leto continued silent, Moneo crossed to the lasgun and retrieved it from the crypt\u0027s cold floor. He began disabling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto watched him, thinking how this tiny scene encapsulated..fostered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe essence of the Army myth. The Army fostered technology because the power of machines appeared so obvious to the shortsighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat lasgun is no more than a machine. But all machines fail or are superceded. Still, the Army worships at the shrine of such things-both fascinated and fearful. Look at how people fear the Ixians! In its guts, the Army knows it is the Sorcerer\u0027s Apprentice. It unleashes technology and never again can the magic be stuffed back into the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI teach them another magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke to the hordes within then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see? Moneo has disabled the deadly instrument. A connection broken here, a small capsule crushed there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto sniffed. He smelled the esters of a preservative oil riding on the stink of Moneo\u0027s perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill speaking inwardly, Leto said: \"But the genie is not dead. Technology breeds anarchy. It distributes these tools at random. And with them goes the provocation for violence. The ability to make and use savage destroyers falls inevitably into the hands of smaller and smaller groups until at last the group is a single individual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo returned to a point below Leto, holding the disabled lasgun casually in his right hand. \"There is talk on Parella and the planets of Dan about another jihad against such things as this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo lifted the lasgun and smiled, signaling that he knew the paradox in such empty dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto closed his eyes. The hordes within wanted to argue, but he shut them off, thinking: Jihads create armies. The Butlerian Jihad tried to rid our universe of machines which simulate the mind of man. The Butlerians left armies in their wake and the lxians still make questionable devices... for which I thank them. What is anathema? The motivation to ravage, no matter the instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto opened his eyes. \"I will go to my tower,\" he said. \"I must have more time to mourn my Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The new one is already on his way here,\" Moneo said. -\u003d You, the first person to encounter my chronicles for at least four thousand years, beware. Do not feel honored by your primacy in reading the revelations of my Ixian storehouse. You will find much pain in it. Other than the few glimpses required to assure me that the Golden Path continued. I never wanted to peer beyond those four millennia. Therefore, I am not sure what the events in my journals may signify to your times. I only know that my journals have suffered oblivion and that the events which I recount have undoubtedly been submitted to historical distortion for eons. I assure you that the ability to view our futures can become a bore. Even to be thought of as a god, as I certainly was, can become ultimately boring. It has occurred to me more than once that holy boredom is good and sufficient reason for the invention of free will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Inscription on the storehouse at bar-es-Balat I am Duncan Idaho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was about all he wanted to know for sure. He did not like the Tleilaxu explanations, their stories. But then the Tleilaxu had always been feared. Disbelieved and feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had brought him down to the planet on a small Guild shuttle, arriving at the dusk line with a green glimmer of sun corona along the horizon as they dipped into the shadow. The spaceport had not looked at all like anything he remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was larger and with a ring of strange buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure this is Dune\u0027?\" he had asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrakis,\" his Tleilaxu escort had corrected him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had sped him in a sealed groundcar to this building somewhere within a city they called Onn, giving the \"n\" sound a strange rising nasal inflection. The room in which they left him was about three meters square, a cube really. There was no sign of glowglobes, but the place was filled with warm yellow light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a ghola, he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been a shock, but he had to believe it. To find himself living when he knew he had died, that was proof enough. The Tleilaxu had taken cells from his dead flesh and they had grown a bud in one of their axlotl tanks. That bud had become this body in a process which had made him feel at first an alien in his own flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the body. It was clothed in dark brown trousers and jacket of a coarse weave which irritated his skin. Sandals protected his feet. Except for the body, that was all they had given him, a parsimony which said something about the real Tleilaxu character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no furniture in the room. They had let him in through a single door which had no handle on the inside. He looked up at the ceiling and around at the walls, at the door. Despite the featureless character of the place, he felt that he was being watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women of the Imperial Guard will come for you,\" they had said. Then they had gone away, smiling slyly among themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen of the Imperial Guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tleilaxu escort had taken sadistic delight in exposing their shapechanging abilities. He had not known from one minute to the next what new form the plastic flow of their flesh would present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamned Face Dancers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had known all about him, of course, had known how much the Shape Changers disgusted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could he trust if it came from Face Dancers\u0027? Very little. Could anything they said be believed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name. I know my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had his memories. They had shocked the identity back into him. Gholas were supposed to be incapable of recovering the original identity. But the Tleilaxu had done it and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe was forced to believe because he understood how it had been done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, he knew, there had been the fully formed ghola, adult flesh without name or memories-a palimpsest upon which the Tleilaxu could write almost anything they wished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Ghola,\" they had said. That had been his only name for a long time. Ghola had been taken like a malleable infant and conditioned to kill a particular man-a man so like the original Paul Muad\u0027Dib he had served and adored that Idaho now suspected it might have been another ghola. But if that were true, where had they obtained the original cells?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in the Idaho cells had rebelled at killing an Atreides. He had found himself standing with a knife in one hand, the bound form of the pseudo-Paul staring up at him in angry terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories had gushered into his awareness. He remembered Ghola and he remembered Duncan Idaho. am Duncan Idaho, swordmaster of the Atreides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clung to this memory as he stood in the yellow room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI died defending Paul and his mother in a cave-sietch beneath the sands of Dune. I have been returned to that planet, but Dune is no more. Now it is only Arrakis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had read the truncated history which the Tleilaxu provided, but he did not believe it. More than thirty-five hundred years? Who could believe his flesh existed after such a time? Except... with Tleilaxu it was possible. He had to believe his own senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have been many of you,\" his instructors had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lord Leto will provide that information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Leto?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tleilaxu history said this Lord Leto was Leto II, grandson of the Leto whom Idaho had served with fanatical devotion. But this second Leto (so the history said) had become something... something so strange that Idaho despaired of understanding the transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could a human slowly turn into a sandworm? How could any thinking creature live more than three thousand years? Not even the wildest projections of geriatric spice allowed such a lifespan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto II, the God Emperor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tleilaxu history was not to be believed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho remembered a strange child-twins, really: Leto and Ghanima, Paul\u0027s children, the children of Chani, who had died delivering them. The Tleilaxu history said Ghanima had died after a relatively normal life, but the God Emperor Leto lived on and on and on...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is a tyrant,\" Idaho\u0027s instructors had said. \"He has ordered us to produce you from our axlotl tanks and to send you into his service. We do not know what has happened to your predecessor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, Idaho let his gaze wander around the featureless walls and ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faint sound of voices intruded upon his awareness. He looked at the door. The voices were muted, but at least one of them sounded female.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen of the Imperial Guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung inward on noiseless hinges. Two women entered. The first thing to catch his attention was the fact that one of the women wore a mask, a cibus hood of shapeless, light-drinking black. She would see him clearly through the hood, he knew, but her features would never reveal themselves, not even to the most subtle instruments of penetration. The hood said that the Ixians or their inheritors were still at work in the Imperium. Both women wore one-piece uniforms of rich blue with the Atreides hawk in red braid at the left breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho studied them as they closed the door and faced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe masked woman had a blocky, powerful body. She moved with the deceptive care of a professional muscle fanatic. The other woman was graceful and slender with almond eyes in sharp, high-boned features. Idaho had the feeling that he had seen her somewhere, but he could not fix the memory. Both women carried needle knives in hip sheaths. Something about their movements told Idaho these women would be extremely competent with such weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slender one spoke first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Luli. Let me be the first to address you as Commander. My companion must remain anonymous. Our Lord Leto has commanded it. You may address her as Friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the Lord Leto\u0027s wish that you command his Royal Guard,\" Luli said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That so? Let\u0027s go talk to him about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\" Luli was visibly shocked. \"The Lord Leto will summon you when it is time. For now, he wishes us to make you comfortable and happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I must obey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuli merely shook her head in puzzlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I a slave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuli relaxed and smiled. \"By no means. It\u0027s just. that the Lord Leto has many great concerns which require his personal attention. He must make time for you. He sent us because he was concerned about his Duncan Idaho. You have been a long time in the hands of the dirty Tleilaxu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirty Tleilaxu, Idaho thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, at least, had not changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was concerned, though, by a particular reference in Luli\u0027s explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His Duncan Idaho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you not an Atreides warrior?\" Luli asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had him there. Idaho nodded, turning his head slightly to stare at the enigmatic masked woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you masked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must not be known that I serve the Lord Leto,\" she said. Her voice was a pleasant contralto, but Idaho suspected that this, too, was masked by the cibus hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lord Leto trusts me to determine if you have been tampered with by the dirty Tleilaxu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho tried to swallow in a suddenly dry throat. This thought had occurred to him several times aboard the Guild transport. If the Tleilaxu could condition a ghola to attempt the murder of a dear friend, what else might they plant in the psyche of the regrown flesh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that you have thought about this,\" the masked woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a mentat?\" Idaho asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\" Luli interrupted. \"The Lord Leto does not permit the training of mentats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho glanced at Luli, then returned his attention to the masked woman. No mentats. The Tleilaxu history had not mentioned that interesting fact. Why would Leto prohibit mentats? Surely, the human mind trained in the super abilities of computation still had its uses. The Tleilaxu had assured him that the Great Convention remained in force and that mechanical computers were still anathema. Surely, these women would know that the Atreides themselves had used mentats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your opinion?\" the masked woman asked. \"Have the dirty Tleilaxu tampered with your psyche?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t... think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are not certain?\" ..No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not fear, Commander Idaho,\" she said. \"We have ways of making sure and ways of dealing with such problems should they arise. The dirty Tleilaxu have tried it only once and they paid dearly for their mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s reassuring. Did the Lord Leto send me any messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuli spoke up: \"He told us to assure you that he still loves you as the Atreides have always loved you.\" She was obviously awed by her own words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho relaxed slightly. As an old Atreides hand, superbly trained by them, he had found it easy to determine several things from this encounter. These two had been heavily conditioned to a fanatic obedience. If a cibus mask could hide the identity of that woman, there had to be many more whose bodies were very similar. All of this spoke of dangers around Leto which still required the old and subtle services of spies and an imaginative arsenal of weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuli looked at her companion. \"What say you, Friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may be brought to the Citadel,\" the masked woman said. \"This is not a good place. Tleilaxu have been here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A warm bath and change of clothing would be pleasant,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuli continued to look at her Friend. \"You are certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wisdom of the Lord cannot be questioned,\" the masked woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho did not like the sound of fanaticism in this Friend\u0027s voice, but he felt secure in the integrity of the Atreides. They could appear cynical and cruel to outsiders and enemies, but to their own people they were just and they were loyal. Above all else, the Atreides were loyal to their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am one of theirs, Idaho thought. But what happened to the me that I am replacing? He felt strongly that these two would not answer this question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Leto will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we go?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m anxious to wash the stink of the dirty Tleilaxu off me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuli grinned at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come. I shall bathe you myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnemies strengthen you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllies weaken. -\u003d I tell you this in the hope that it will help you understand why I ad as I do in the full knowledge that great forces accumulate in my Empire with but one wish-the wish to destroy me. You who read these words may know full well what actually happened, but I doubt that you understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals THE CEREMONY of \"Showing\" by which the rebels began their meetings dragged on interminably for Siona. She sat in the front row and looked everywhere but at Topri, who was conducting the ceremony only a few paces away. This room in the service burrows beneath Onn was one they had never used before but it was so like all of their other meeting places that it could have been used as a standard model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebel Meeting Room-class B, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was officially designated as a storage chamber and the fixed glowglobes could not be tuned away from their blank white glaring. The room was about thirty paces long and slightly less in width. It could be reached only through a labyrinthine series of similar chambers, one of which was conveniently stocked with a supply of stiff folding chairs intended for the small sleeping chambers of the service personnel. Nineteen of Siona\u0027s fellow rebels now occupied these chairs around her, with a few empty for any latecomers who might still make the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time had been set between the midnight and morning shifts to mask the flow of extra people in the service warrens. Most of the rebels wore energy-worker disguises-thin gray disposable trousers and jackets. Some few, including Siona, were garbed in the green of machinery inspectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTopri\u0027s voice was an insistent monotone in the room. He did not squeak at all while conducting the ceremony. In fact, Siona had to admit he was rather good at it, especially with new recruits. Since Nayla\u0027s flat statement that she did not trust the man, though, Siona had looked at Topri in a different way. Nayla could speak with a cutting naivete which pulled away masks. And there were things that Siona had learned about Topri since that confrontation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona turned at last and looked at the man. The cold silvery light did not help Topri\u0027s pale skin. He used a copy of a crysknife in the ceremony, a contraband copy bought from the Museum Fremen. Siona recalled the transaction as she looked at the blade in Topri\u0027s hands. It had been Topri\u0027s idea, and she had thought it a good one at the time. He had led her to the rendezvous in a hovel on the city\u0027s outskirts, leaving Onn just at dusk. They had waited well into the night until darkness could mask the Museum Freemen\u0027s coming. Fremen were not supposed to leave their sietch quarters without a special dispensation from the God Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had almost given up on him when the Fremen arrived, slipping in out of the night, his escort left behind to guard the door. Topri and Siona had been waiting on a crude bench against a dank wall of the absolutely plain room. The only light had come from a dim yellow torch supported on a stick driven into the crumbling mud wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen\u0027s first words had filled Siona with misgivings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you brought the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Topri and Siona had risen at his entry. Topri did not appear bothered by the question. He tapped the pouch beneath his robe, making it jingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the money right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen was a wizened figure, crabbed and bent, wearing a copy of the old Fremen robes and some glistening garment underneath, probably their version of a stillsuit. His hood was drawn forward, shading his features. The torchlight sent shadows dancing across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered first at Topri then at Siona before removing an object wrapped in cloth from beneath his robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a true copy, but it is made of plastic,\" he said. \"It will not cut cold grease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the blade from its wrappings then and held it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona, who had seen crysknives only in museums and in the rare old visual recordings of her family\u0027s archives, had found herself oddly gripped by the sight of the blade in this setting. She felt something atavistic working on her and imagined this poor Museum Fremen with his plastic crysknife as a real Fremen of the old days. The thing he held was suddenly a silver-bladed crysknife shimmering in the yellow shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guarantee the authenticity of the blade from which we copied it,\" the Fremen said. He spoke in a low voice, somehow made menacing by its lack of emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona heard it then, the way he carried his venom in a sleeve of soft vowels and she was suddenly alerted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try treachery and we will hunt you down like vermin,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTopri shot a startled glance at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Museum Fremen appeared to shrivel, drawing in upon himself. The blade trembled in his hand, but his gnome fingers still curled inward around it as though clasping a throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treachery, Lady? Oh, no. But it occurred to us that we asked too little for this copy. Poor as it is, making it and selling it this way puts us in dreadful peril.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona glared at him, thinking of the old Fremen words from the Oral History: \"Once you acquire a marketplace soul, the suk is the totality of existence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much do you want?\" she demanded. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-3.html","bookId":2156,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM"}
