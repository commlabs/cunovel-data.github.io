THE RETURN.","content":"HERBERT was quite sure the Texans would not be gone long, unless they, too, became involved in a fight with the dusky raiders and shared in the probable fate of Eph Bozeman. If such proved to be the case, there would be sounds of the conflict, which would be as brief as it was desperate, and it was those for which he listened while sitting in his saddle on the slope.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The stillness remaining unbroken, he turned his pony toward the point he had left, and found, on reaching it, that Strubell and Lattin had arrived a few minutes before and were becoming anxious over his absence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was now a question whether the three should stay where they were or go elsewhere with their animals. The Apaches were prowling around the surrounding country so closely that it looked as if they had located the group.[276] Such was the view of Strubell and Herbert, but Lattin, on the other hand, was so positive that their enemies knew nothing of their presence that the others agreed to stay where they were until something more certain became known.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Trouble was likely to follow a change of base, since the trapper on his return would be puzzled to find them, though the Texans would be sure to give him all the help they could, and that was considerable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing therefore to do but to wait, the most wearisome occupation of anyone. The nerves of all were strung to such a high point that there was little inclination to sleep. It was a long time since they had eaten or drank, and they were in need of food and drink, but no step was to be taken for the procurement of either until the momentous question was settled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lattin believed that the Indian horseman seen by Herbert received no inkling of the truth. His pony had detected something, and his rider, bringing him to a halt, sat looking and listening for the explanation that did not[277] come. Concluding it was some wild animal or reptile moving in the grass, he had dashed off to join his companions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Inasmuch as both the Texans were in accord by this time in the theory that they were not discovered by the red men, at the time of the scare just before sunset, the youth felt no fear in that regard. It followed therefore that the Apaches were unaware of their presence, and were not likely to learn of it except through some accident.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No one could forecast the result of the pistol shot that had rung out over the prairie, and which showed that the trapper’s stealthy journey to the building had not been without incident.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The little company spoke only at intervals, and then in whispers. Their eyes and ears were so intently engaged that conversation interfered. The stillness was so profound that the champing of the horses was heard as they cropped the grass, while the sound of the hoofs was so distinct when they shifted about, that it seemed to Herbert they must draw the Apaches to the spot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [278]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By and by one of the ponies stopped eating and lay down, then two others did the same, but the fourth kept it up so long that Lattin was about to go out and compel him to retire to his couch, when he did so. This left the quiet so perfect that it would have taken a wonderfully skilful warrior to steal up undetected on foot, and it was impossible for a horseman to do so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The stars twinkled from a sky that was unclouded except in the western horizon, where a bank of clouds climbed part way to the zenith and shut out a portion of the faint light. In whatever direction the watchers gazed was the same blank darkness. Though they knew that men were near and constantly in motion, no glimpse of them was obtained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Baker,” said the elder Texan in his guarded undertone, “I’m going to sleep for half an hour.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All right,” replied his companion; “I’ll do the same when you wake up.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Strubell made not the slightest change in his position. He simply turned his head sideways upon his arm, bent at the elbow, and[279] shut his eyes. Almost at the same moment he became unconscious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The party had not removed their blankets from the backs of the ponies, through fear that it might delay them whenever a sudden movement should become necessary. They were stretched at full length on the grass. In that salubrious country, with its pure, dry air, there was no thought of ill results therefrom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Herbert was near Lattin, and he asked:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Will he wake at the end of the half hour?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If he don’t I’ll wake him,” replied the other; “but I never knew Ard to vary more’n a minute or two.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What do you make of Bozeman’s long absence? Several hours must have gone by.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It seems later than it is, but I expected him back before this.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How do you account for his delay?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There may be several causes,” replied Lattin; “in the first place, maybe he run into a hornets’ nest and was knifed before he could shoot a second chamber of his revolver. Them Apaches work quick at such business,[280] and they would shove Eph under in the style of greased lightning.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But,” suggested Herbert, who was after every grain of comfort, “it might be he found trouble in getting inside the building.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s likely, though Ard and me went up in sight of it without runnin’ agin any of the varmints; but it couldn’t have kept him all this time, for if he didn’t get inside long ago he would have given up and come back to us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you suppose there has been any trouble with Rickard?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t see what trouble there could be; all the work Eph had was to find out the best the scamp would do, and then either agree or disagree with him. The most likely trouble is that Eph found the varmints so plentiful when he started to come back that he hasn’t been able to get through and is waiting for the chance.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If that proves the case, what will be done in the morning?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s hard to tell till the morning comes. Rickard and Slidham may come out to help us fight our way in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [281]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The incident was not impossible, but what a unique state of affairs it suggested! It recalled the affairs in the Southwest, during the Mexican War, when a party of Comanches and “Greasers” would assail a handful of Americans, working as the most ardent allies until the Americans were disposed of, when the Mexicans and Indians would turn upon each other like cat o’ mountains.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hello!” said Lattin a few minutes later, “there’s the moon.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The upper edge of the gibbous orb was creeping above the horizon, and looked like the point of a fiery spear as it climbed rapidly upward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s going to give us help,” said Herbert, watching the satellite, whose ascent was strikingly swift.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know about that,” replied the Texan; “it will let us see further ‘cross the prairie, but don’t forget that it’ll do the same for the varmints. It won’t be so easy for Eph to get back as it was to go forward, always providin’ that he did go forward.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Strubell slumbered as quietly as an infant.[282] His breathing could not be heard, even in the perfect stillness which reigned. Herbert glanced at him more than once, with an odd fear that perhaps he was dead, but that was hardly possible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Knowing the direction of the building, Lattin and Herbert tried to peer through the gloom and see it, but the light was insufficient to show its most shadowy outlines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Baker,” whispered the youth, “I think I see something out there toward the building.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Whether you do or not,” replied the Texan, “I’m sure I do; someone is comin’ this way.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It must be an Apache.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Keep quiet; we’ll soon see.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the hunter spoke, he made sure his rifle was ready to fire the instant it should become necessary. He was not troubled by the tender conscience of his companion in that respect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The approaching figure was on foot, and, though advancing without noise, did so swiftly. It rapidly grew more distinct in the gloom,[283] until the broad-brimmed hat, the massive frame, with the long rifle grasped in one hand, left no doubt of its identity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was old Eph Bozeman returning at last.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1539/45843.html","bookId":1300,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:27:25 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:27:25 AM"}
