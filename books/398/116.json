This money is destined for our brave Captain Guillet\u0027s old mother. He was killed at the last assault. He bequeathed her to his company before he died. The Republic is not very rich and might forget to pay the pensions of its widows. Well, in default of a pension the company will send her a little capital. It is a great pity, though, that those fools of Turks and those devils of Englishmen should have guessed our game and refused to keep it up any longer; we would have made up a sum of a thousand francs for the poor woman. But what will you, citizen-paymaster! The prettiest girl in the world can give no more than she has; and the thirty-second brigade, although it is the prettiest girl in the army, has only one hundred and seventy francs to offer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where does Captain Guillet\u0027s mother live?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At Chateauroux, the capital of the Indre.
