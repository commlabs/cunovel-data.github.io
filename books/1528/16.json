One of them was your father, Elizabeth. The other was Dr. Trent McBride, a biomedical engineer in brain physiology.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth knew that name. She remembered late-night visits, her father sequestering himself with strangers in his study, including Dr. McBride. He was hard to forget with his loud, boisterous voice, but in a good-hearted way. He also brought her gifts when she was younger. First editions of Nancy Drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I attempted to contact Dr. McBride,” Painter continued. “Only to learn that no one’s heard from him in the last five months.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth felt a cold chill. Five months. “The same time my father flew to India.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shared a worried glance with Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:40 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri Raev exited the elevator on the subbasement floor of the research facility. After getting the phone call, it had taken him forty-five minutes to reach the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland. The building housed half a million square feet of laboratory space, much of it designated for BL-3 biohazard research, meaning it dealt with all manner of infectious diseases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri had used the panic code—Pandora—to reach the Jasons. It had taken another ten minutes to patch an alert to those he sought, an inner cabal of the organization who had cooperated with the Russians on the project for the greater good of both nations. Yuri had hoped to get the Jasons working on his behalf, to keep Sasha out of Mapplethorpe’s hands. The Jasons, with their various scientific backgrounds, understood the delicacy it took in handling the child, both physiologically and psychologically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMapplethorpe on the other hand was all about brinkmanship, political ambitions, and blind self-interest. Yuri didn’t trust the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Sasha missing, Yuri needed allies on American soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been instructed to meet Dr. James Chen, a neurologist and a member of the inner circle, to plan a strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would be joined by another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone who could help, he was cryptically told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri was given specific directions and clearance to the location of the rendezvous. He started down the hallway. At this hour, all the doors were closed. Few laboratories were down at this level. As he walked, bleach burned his nose and masked a muskier scent. Behind one door, he heard a familiar soft hoot of something simian. Here was where the facility must house its live-animal research subjects, deserted of personnel at this hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked the room number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB-2 340.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the door with a frosted glass panel and knocked. A shadow passed across the pane, and the door opened promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Raev. Thank you for coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri barely got a glimpse of the young Asian man as he turned away. He wore a white laboratory coat over blue denim pants. A pair of eyeglasses rested atop his head, as if forgotten there. The room held a utilitarian table along one wall, and a bank of stainless-steel cages filled the opposite side. A few whiskered black noses poked between the bars. The scritch-scratch of tiny nails whispered from the cages. Laboratory rats. Only these were hairless, except for their whiskers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Chen led him through an open back door. There he found a cluttered office: a steel desk stacked with journals, a whiteboard jotted with boxed to-do lists, and a bookcase crammed with glass specimen jars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri was surprised to find a familiar figure hulked behind the desk, a cell phone at his ear. The man, edging toward his midfifties, demonstrated his Scottish heritage in his massive frame, ruddy cheeks, and a red-and-gray beard tidily trimmed close to a jutting jaw. He was the head of the cabal of Jasons assigned to assist the Russians—and also a colleague and longtime friend of Archibald Polk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Trent McBride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s just arrived,” the man said into the phone with a nod toward Yuri. “I’ll brief everyone in an hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride closed his cell phone, stood, and held out his hand. “I’ve been updated on your situation, Yuri. Considering the girl’s fragile state, this is a top priority. We’ll do what we can to help find the child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri shook his hand and sat down. Although startled, he felt relieved to find McBride here. Beneath his good-natured bravado, the man had a sharp and practical mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So then you understand,” Yuri said, “how vital it is that we acquire her again? And soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “How many hours can the girl survive without her medication?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty-two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And her last injection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seven hours,” he answered grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves Sasha only a little over a day to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we’ll have to move fast,” McBride said. “As you might suspect, Mapplethorpe had already called me. In fact, that’s why I’m here myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you were in Geneva. Hadn’t you decided to keep a low profile? To keep hidden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just until matters with Archibald settled out.” His eyes hardened slightly at Yuri. “Which it seems it has. Though the outcome could have been better. He was my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, as well as I, that Dr. Polk would not have survived another few days. I had to do what was necessary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride seemed little mollified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if you recall,” Yuri added, “I voted against approaching Dr. Polk in the first place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride sagged back into his chair with a squeak. “I truly thought Archibald would be more amenable, especially once he saw the project firsthand. After all, it was an extension of his life’s work. And considering the threat he posed, the only other option was—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain a sad shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Polk had been treading too close to the heart of the research project. Closer than even McBride knew. It left them only two choices: recruit him or eliminate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecruitment failed…disastrously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrought to the Warren, the man had ended up escaping with valuable intelligence. They had no choice but to hunt him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry about Archibald,” Yuri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he truly was. Dr. Polk’s death, while a tragic necessity, was still a profound loss. On his own, the professor had accomplished so much, even coming close to exposing what the Russians had been keeping secret from the Americans. Ultimately both sides had underestimated Dr. Polk’s resourcefulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth prior to kidnapping him and afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri continued. “In regards to the missing girl—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride interrupted. “I presume she is one of your Omega subjects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Tested at the ninety-seven percentile range. She’s vital to our project. To both our work. I fear Mapplethorpe doesn’t understand the delicate balance needed to keep an Omega subject alive and functioning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride rubbed the bridge of his nose. “During my phone conversation with him, Mapplethorpe did happen to suggest that we might want to acquire the child ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suspected he would try something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Yuri, the door to the outer office opened. He heard Dr. Chen greet someone, stiff and formal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri swung around, shocked to see the subject of their discussion appear at the door. Mapplethorpe’s sagging features looked even more dour than usual. A chill of misgiving spiked through Yuri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride stood. “John, we were just talking about you. Did your team have any luck acquiring the augmented skull?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We’ve scoured both museums.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Odd,” McBride said with a worried frown. “And what word on the girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have helicopters sweeping the entire city grid, section by section, radiating out from the zoo. Still no hits on the tracking device.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri fixed upon this last bit of information. “Tracking…what tracking device?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride stepped around the desk. He held out a closed fist toward Yuri—then opened his fingers and exposed a tiny object resting on his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely larger than the head of a pin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri had to lean closer to even see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonders of nanotechnology,” McBride said. “A passive microtransmitter with burst-pulse attenuator, all housed in a sterile polymer sleeve. While on my last visit to the Warren, I had all the children injected with them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri knew nothing about such implantations; then again, he wasn’t kept abreast of everything. “Did Savina approve such trackers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up to see McBride lift one eyebrow at him. Surely you’re smarter than that, Dr. Raev, he seemed to imply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri realized what the American was insinuating. Savina knew nothing about the matter. It was McBride who had injected the children—in secret, without anyone’s knowledge. He’d had plenty of access to the children, but always while being monitored. Yuri studied the size of the microtransmitter. It was small enough to have been delivered in a hundred different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would McBride—?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri’s mind quickly cascaded through the possibilities, implications, and consequences. McBride must have placed trackers in all the children. Once he had the children implanted, all he had to do was set up the proper scenario that would require one or more of the children to leave the nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri pictured Archibald Polk’s face. The realization struck him like a blow to the solar plexus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a ruse all along,” Yuri gasped out. “Dr. Polk’s escape…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride smiled his agreement. “Very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMapplethorpe’s shadow fell upon him like a physical weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri had been played the fool. He glared over at McBride. “You were at the Warren when Archibald escaped. You helped him escape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod. “We needed some way to lure one of your Omega subjects out into the open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You used Dr. Polk like bait. Your own friend and colleague.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A necessity, I’m afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he…did Archibald know he was being used?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride sighed with a tired ache in his voice. “I think he might have suspected…though he didn’t have much choice. Die or run the gauntlet. Sometimes you have to be a patriot whether you want to or not. And I must say he did well. He almost crossed the goal line.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-16.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
