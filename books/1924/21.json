And work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Trey was studying to be a veterinarian and juggling jobs to pay for it. One of those gigs was as a photographer’s assistant, which was how he’d met Cary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced. “Both brutal, but it’ll pay off someday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should have another movie-and-pizza night when you get a chance.” I couldn’t help rooting for Trey in the tug-of-war between him and Tatiana. It could just be me, but she’d always seemed very adversarial toward me. And I didn’t like the way she’d put herself forward when she met Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. I’ll see what Cary’s schedule is like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regretted bringing it up to Trey first instead of Cary, because some of the light left his eyes. I knew he was thinking about Cary having to fit him in between time with Tatiana. “Well, if he’s not up for it, we can always go out without him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth tilted up on one side. “Sounds like a plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT ten minutes to one, I exited the lobby to find Clancy already waiting for me. He waved aside the doorman and opened the town car door for me, but no one looking at him would believe he was just a driver. He carried himself like the weapon he was, and in all the years I’d known him, I couldn’t recall ever seeing him smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he’d resumed his seat behind the wheel, he turned off the police scanner he routinely listened to and pulled his sunglasses down enough to catch my eye in the rearview mirror. “How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better than my mom, I’m guessing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too professional to give anything away in his expression. Instead, he slid his shades back into place and synced my phone to the car’s Bluetooth to start my playlist. Then he pulled away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReminded of his thoughtfulness, I said, “Hey. I’m sorry I took it out on you. You were doing a job and you didn’t deserve to get bitched at for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not just a job, Miss Tramell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent for a bit, absorbing that. Clancy and I had a distant, polite association. We saw each other quite a bit because he was responsible for getting me to and from my Krav Maga classes in Brooklyn. But I’d never really thought about him having any sort of personal stake in my safety, although it made sense. Clancy was a guy who took pride in his work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t just that one thing, though,” I clarified. “A lot of stuff happened before you and Stanton ever came into the picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apology accepted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brusque reply was so like him that it made me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSettling more comfortably into the seat, I looked out the window at the city I’d adopted and loved passionately. On the sidewalk beside me, strangers stood shoulder to shoulder over a tiny counter, eating individual slices of pizza. As close as they were, they were distant, each displaying a New Yorker’s ability to be an island in a crashing tide of people. Pedestrians flowed past them in both directions, avoiding a man pushing religious flyers and the tiny dog at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vitality of the city had a frenetic pulse that made time seem to move faster here than anywhere else. It was such a contrast to the lazy sensuality of Southern California, where my dad lived and I’d gone to school. New York was a dominatrix on the prowl, cracking a mean whip and tantalizing with every vice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy purse vibrated against my hip and I reached into it for my phone. A quick glance at the screen told me it was my dad. Saturdays were our weekly catch-up days and I always looked forward to our chats, but I was almost inclined to let the call go to voice mail until I was in a better frame of mind. I was too aggravated with my mom, and my dad had already been overly concerned about me since he’d left New York after his last visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been with me when the detectives had come to my apartment to tell me Nathan was in New York. They’d dropped that bomb before they revealed that Nathan had been murdered, and I hadn’t been able to hide my fear at the thought of him being so close. My dad had been after me about my violent reaction ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I answered, mostly because I didn’t want to be at odds with both my parents at the same time. “How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Missing you,” he replied in the deep, confident voice I loved. My dad was the most perfect man I knew—darkly handsome, self-assured, smart, and rock solid. “How ’bout you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t complain too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, complain just a little. I’m all ears.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed softly. “Mom’s just driving me a little batty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d she do now?” he asked, with a note of warm indulgence in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s been sticking her nose in my business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. Sometimes we parents do that when we’re worried about our babies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve never done that,” I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t done it yet,” he qualified. “That doesn’t mean I won’t, if I’m worried enough. I just hope I could convince you to forgive me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m on my way to Mom’s now. Let’s see how convincing she can be. It would help if she’d admit she’s wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha! Right?” I sighed. “Can I call you tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Is everything all right, sweetheart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes. Cop instincts plus daddy instincts meant I rarely got anything by Victor Reyes. “Yep. It’s just that I’m almost to Mom’s now. I’ll let you know how it goes. Oh, and my boss might be getting engaged. Anyway, I have stuff to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I may have to stop by the station in the morning, but you can reach me on my cell no matter what. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a sudden surge of homesickness. As much as I loved New York and my new life, I missed my dad a lot. “I love you, too, Daddy. Talk to you tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling the call, I looked for my wristwatch, and its absence reminded me of the confrontation ahead. I was upset with my mother about the past, but was most concerned with the future. She’d hovered over me for so long because of Nathan, I wasn’t sure she knew any other way to behave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” I leaned forward, needing to clarify something that was bothering me. “That day when me, Mom, and Megumi were walking back to the Crossfire and Mom freaked out … Did you guys see Nathan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’d been there before and got his ass beat by Gideon Cross. Why would he go back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me through the mirror. “My guess? To be seen. Once he made himself known, he kept the pressure up. Likely, he expected to frighten you and managed to scare Mrs. Stanton instead. Effective in either case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And no one told me,” I said quietly. “I can’t get over that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wanted you frightened. No one wanted to give him that satisfaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. I hadn’t thought of it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My big regret,” he went on, “is not keeping an eye on Cary. I miscalculated, and he paid the price.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon hadn’t seen Nathan’s attack on Cary coming, either. And God knew I felt guilty about it, too—my friendship was what had put Cary in danger to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was really touched that Clancy cared. I could hear it in his gruff voice. He was right; I wasn’t just a job to him. He was a good man who gave his all to everything he did. Which made me wonder: How much did he have left over for the other things in his life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a girlfriend, Clancy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like an ass for not knowing that. What was she like, the woman married to such a hard, somber man? A man who wore a jacket year-round to hide the sidearm he was never without. Did he soften for her and show her tenderness? Was he fierce about protecting her? Would he kill for her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How far would you go to keep her safe?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slowed at a light and he turned his head to look at me. “How far wouldn’t I go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WHAT WAS WRONG with that one?” Megumi asked, watching the guy in question walk away. “He had dimples.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and polished off my vodka and cranberry. Primal, the fourth stop on our club-hopping list, was pumping. The line to get in wrapped around the block and the guitar-heavy tracks suited the club’s name, the music pounding through the darkened space with a primitive, seductive beat. The décor was an eclectic mix of brushed metals and dark woods, with the multihued lighting creating animal-print silhouettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should’ve been too much, but like everything Gideon, it skirted the edge of decadent excess without falling over it. The atmosphere was one of hedonistic abandon and it did crazy things to my alcohol-fueled libido. I couldn’t sit still, my feet tapping restlessly on the rungs of my chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegumi’s roommate, Lacey, groaned at the ceiling, her dark blond hair arranged in a disheveled updo I admired. “Why don’t you flirt with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might,” Megumi said, looking flushed, bright-eyed, and very hot in a slinky gold halter dress. “Maybe he’ll commit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want out of commitment?” Shawna asked, nursing a drink as fiery red as her hair. “Monogamy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monogamy is overrated.” Lacey slid off her bar stool at our tallboy table and wriggled her butt, the rhinestones on her jeans glittering in the semidarkness of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s not.” Megumi pouted. “I happen to like monogamy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Michael sleeping with other women?” I asked, leaning forward so I didn’t have to shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to lean back right away to make room for the waitress, who brought another round and cleared the previous one away. The club’s uniform of black stiletto boots and hot pink strapless minidresses stood out in the crowd, making it easy to know who to flag. It was also really sexy—as was the staff wearing them. Had Gideon had any hand in picking the outfit? And if so, had anyone modeled it for him? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/entwined-with-you-crossfire-3/page-21.html","bookId":1924,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
