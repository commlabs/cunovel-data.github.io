It was Jasmine who finally got things moving again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s grip on the form tightened, and for a second, I feared he\u0027d crumple or rip it. Instead, he let it fall to the floor and strode toward me as swiftly and fiercely as his predatory alter ego. I felt Jasmine shift - not away, but closer to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" he asked, in a low, deadly voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About which part?\" I snapped. \"That I\u0027m pregnant? Or that it\u0027s yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my eyes narrow as I continued feeling angry and defensive. \"Yes. Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell. Then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you getting rid of it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ. You get right to the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the point!\" he exclaimed. \"You know what it\u0027s always been! You\u0027re sure? You\u0027re really sure you\u0027re pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d had the same questions for Dr. Moore and found myself repeating her answer. \"Yes. The tests are very accurate. Besides, why else do you think they\u0027d schedule me for that?\" I pointed to the referral lying on the floor. He might work with animals, but he\u0027d still know what a CVS was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasmine, however, did not. She slipped away, gave him a wide berth, and retrieved the paper. \"What\u0027s a ... chorionic ... vil-vil - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a test to detect defects,\" I said. I gave Kiyo a pointed look. \"And gender.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a waste of time,\" he argued. He swallowed and attempted a kinder, more reasonable course with me. \"Eugenie, you know the danger. You can\u0027t waste another day. If anyone finds out - if anyone in the Otherworld - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know! Do you think I\u0027m stupid? Do you think I somehow missed the constant rape attempts - and actual rape - based on that prophecy? Damn it, I know better than you what it means! But I can\u0027t - I can\u0027t get an abortion until I know what it is. If it\u0027s a girl or a boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what?\" he asked. \"You\u0027ll keep it if it\u0027s a girl? You always said you weren\u0027t sure you wanted to have kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still not,\" I admitted, my voice trembling. A baby - world conqueror or not - had never been on my agenda. \"But I have to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression darkened, the coaxing gone. \"It\u0027s better if you don\u0027t. It\u0027s better to keep it all anonymous, better not to think of it as a person. Stay ignorant. Just have the abortion and be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasmine hadn\u0027t moved from her spot, her eyes going back and forth as she watched my verbal volley with Kiyo. \"Geez,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t seem too upset about killing your own kid.\" I had been thinking the same thing. His cold detachment shocked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched and gritted his teeth. \"I never said I\u0027m not upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not just upset about what this means for the prophecy,\" I pointed out. I studied him carefully, realization dawning. \"You don\u0027t entirely believe it\u0027s yours anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you blame me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s yours,\" I said adamantly. The last time I\u0027d been with Dorian, we\u0027d had kinky oral sex. Maybe I hadn\u0027t known about antibiotics interacting with birth control pills, but I knew where a guy had to come to make you pregnant. \"I know without a doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gave Kiyo pause, as though he really were truly pondering the reality of losing his child. \"I told you: I never said I\u0027m not upset about this. But it\u0027s got to be dealt with. How could you have let this happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, nice,\" I said. \"It\u0027s my fault. If you\u0027re so into caution, maybe you shouldn\u0027t have fucked me in that grotto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasmine\u0027s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, forget it,\" he said tightly. \"And forget your CVS. Just get the abortion while it\u0027s still easy. You can\u0027t be that far along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot up. \"While it\u0027s still easy? Like you know! You\u0027re not the one who has to go through it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you fighting me on this?\" he exclaimed in disbelief. \"You always said you\u0027d do this. Do you want the prophecy to come true? Do you want to have a son who leads armies here from the Otherworld to conquer and enslave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not! You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then stop wasting time! Look, if you\u0027re scared about getting it done ... you don\u0027t have to do it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? I can check in at the Otherworld\u0027s Planned Parenthood clinic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said wearily. \"But there are potions. Maiwenn could help. Along with healing, she can work all sorts of other medical magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she can.\" I couldn\u0027t hide the bitterness in my voice. \"And I\u0027m sure she\u0027d be more than happy to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" I interrupted. \"Here\u0027s how it is. I don\u0027t like your attitude. I don\u0027t like you dictating this to me like I\u0027m stupid or something. I know the consequences, okay? And you know where I stand on the prophecy. But I just have to know what exactly is in me first. Two days. We just wait two days for the test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then how long until the results?\" he asked. \"More time passes. Every day is dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it\u0027s a girl?\" This came from Jasmine. Both Kiyo and I turned to her. \"What if Eugenie can have it? You\u0027re always going on and on about how awesome Luisa is. Wouldn\u0027t you want another one - especially with, like, your actual - sort of - girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not - \" Kiyo bit off his words and turned back to me. Those dark eyes studied me, and I felt my anger diffuse as they softened. I felt his love and knew all of this was coming from panic, his fears about the prophecy finally coming true. \"Two days,\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two days,\" I repeated. \"And then I\u0027ll do the right thing.\" I wasn\u0027t exactly sure what the \"right thing\" would be if I was having a girl, seeing as motherhood still didn\u0027t really jump out at me. But that didn\u0027t matter right now. What mattered was that I had the choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, abruptly and without warning, Kiyo wrapped his arms around me, crushing me to his chest. \"I love you,\" he said, voice shaking. It was the first time he\u0027d spoken those words since we\u0027d gotten back together, and they tore something inside of me. \"But I\u0027m just afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am too,\" I said, feeling tears spring into my eyes. Fucking hormones. \"Everything\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he released me, I finally really comprehended that Jasmine had witnessed all of this. The dramatic factor had probably trumped anything she could find on TV. Her face was a blank mask now, which made me uneasy. What was she thinking about all this? For so long, she\u0027d wanted to be the one to have the heir. I supposed she should be all for an abortion. Yet ... maybe she was so keen on our father\u0027s prophecy that she didn\u0027t care who had his grandson, so long as she could ride the power with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to stay with Jasmine tomorrow,\" I told Kiyo later, when we were lying in bed. \"I wish she hadn\u0027t found out about this. Maybe I\u0027m overreacting, but I\u0027m worried she\u0027ll do something with the information. I could have Volusian watch her like he is now ...\" I usually summoned my minion for night watches. \"... But I\u0027d feel better with you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo drew the covers up around us. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. \"Eugenie, you can\u0027t go back there until this mess is settled. If they find out - if anyone finds out - well. All hell will break loose, from those who are for the prophecy and those who are against it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to,\" I said. \"I realize now that most of my being sick is because ... well, you know. But being apart from those lands is affecting me too. I just need to check in.\" No more full-fledged meditation sessions, though. I couldn\u0027t risk any more telltale signs of my pregnancy from that intense communion. I\u0027d just do the bare minimum required. \"And not just with the lands\u0027 magic. I need to keep an eye on the Rowan Land\u0027s transition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feared his reaction, particularly after his earlier outburst. Instead, he brushed a kiss to my lips. \"Be careful. Be quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\" I pushed my lips back, kissing him harder. I moved my body closer to his, wrapping our legs together. I was terrified of what was happening, terrified of what I might be carrying. But now, with Kiyo on my side, I felt safe. We would get through this together, and I suddenly wanted to connect with him and feel his love around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe responded instantly to the kiss, one of his hands tipping my head back in order to consume more of my lips. His other hand gripped my upper arm, nails lightly scratching my skin as animal lust began to take over. Then, abruptly, he stopped and pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked. I started to say he didn\u0027t have to worry about getting me pregnant, but that joke seemed kind of inappropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing ... I\u0027m just ... I\u0027m just tired.\" He kissed me again, but this time it was on my cheek. \"It\u0027s been a long day. Just not up for it tonight ... even though you\u0027re as sexy as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightness in those last words seemed forced, and I was glad he couldn\u0027t see my frown in the darkness. I had just been rejected because ... because why? Having sex during pregnancy wasn\u0027t harmful, I knew that much. Was I repulsive? Was the thought that I was carrying Storm King\u0027s heir putting him off? Whatever the reason, I didn\u0027t buy that he \"wasn\u0027t up for it.\" We\u0027d been pressed hip to hip moments ago, and his body had most certainly been up for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sexless night was the least of my problems, and although neither of us spoke, I knew he slept as badly as I did. We tossed and turned, our movements as disturbing to each other as our individual worries. We both had bloodshot eyes when we woke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed off to the Otherworld as soon as I could after breakfast - well, after what passed as breakfast for me. My appetite was still low. Jasmine wasn\u0027t happy when I denied her request to come with me, but Kiyo and Volusian\u0027s presence was too daunting for her to put up much of a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the Thorn Land\u0027s welcoming energy when I crossed over, but thankfully, it revealed nothing about my maternal state. My staff was equally happy to see me, particularly Shaya, who looked like she\u0027d thought I wasn\u0027t ever going to return. It wasn\u0027t an entirely unwarranted fear. She and I sat alone in one of the parlors while she updated me on the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rurik feels the Rowan Land is stable enough to move in a governing body. There\u0027s still some unrest, and he\u0027ll stay on for a while, but most have accepted your rule. It\u0027s the way things go. He\u0027s also culled the Rowan military and feels you can trust who\u0027s left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to grimace at that, wondering what his \"culling\" had entailed. \"And Katrice and Cassius?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Still imprisoned. Awaiting your verdict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really want to do anything with them,\" I admitted. \"I don\u0027t know what to do with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly? With Katrice? You could set her free, and it wouldn\u0027t matter. Stripping the land from her stripped most of her magic. Her reason to live. She\u0027s harmless. Without hope. But Cassius ...\" Shaya frowned. \"He\u0027s dangerous. He can\u0027t wrestle the land from you, but he\u0027s got enough power to make trouble. Dorian\u0027s already written and advised execution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoffed. \"I\u0027m sure he has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorian\u0027s also provided a list of people he\u0027d like to see installed in the Rowan Land. We settled the resources split, but he feels he deserves a controlling interest in your rule there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A \u0027controlling interest?\u0027 This isn\u0027t a corporation!\" I exclaimed. \"Write him and make it very, very clear that his help isn\u0027t needed over there. It isn\u0027t wanted. He has no right to it. Tell him all of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya hesitated, fretfully toying with one of her black braids. \"No matter how diplomatically I word that ... well, the antagonism will still come through. It\u0027ll anger him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I retorted. Dorian was a safe target for my churning emotions at the moment, and God knew I needed some sort of outlet. \"Let him be angry or pout or whatever. I\u0027m pretty sure he isn\u0027t going to declare war on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something I\u0027d figured out recently. Dorian had been an advocate of using the Iron Crown to scare other monarchs, but the thing was, now that we weren\u0027t together anymore, he had to realize it could be used against him too. I actually hadn\u0027t had to give in to his \"spoils of war\" demands. That had been a kindness on my part, and he knew it. I didn\u0027t have to fear Dorian. I no longer needed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Shaya replied. Her tone was obedient, but I knew she dreaded that letter. She\u0027d never lost her devotion to him, and I was forcing her to split her loyalties. \"But we do need someone to manage the Rowan Land ... unless you\u0027re going to do it personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said swiftly, not that I needed to. She\u0027d already known I had no interest in it. \"Do you have someone in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.... Me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t exactly surprised that she\u0027d step up to the task. I was surprised, however, that she didn\u0027t look particularly upset about it. Maybe she relished the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m cool with that,\" I said. \"Hell, after what you did around here, I know you can get Rowan into shape. But ... who\u0027s going to run things here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking Nia could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nia?\" I asked, startled. \"My hairstylist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya crooked me a grin. \"What do you think she does when you\u0027re not around? She\u0027s been helping me and learning.... I think she\u0027d do very well. There\u0027d be others to assist her, and, of course, she could always contact me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still an unexpected choice, but Shaya seemed confident. And, I supposed, we\u0027d gotten the Thorn Land into good enough shape that it now functioned pretty smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said at last. \"Let\u0027s make it happen. When do you plan on moving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll go when you go. My things are packed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help laughing. \"You knew I\u0027d agree. And you knew I\u0027d refuse Dorian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya put on her primmest look, but her eyes sparkled. \"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked the Thorn Land before leaving, long enough to reassure the land I was there and boost the morale of the soldiers guarding my keep. Not that they needed it. We were victorious, and they were still celebrating. I\u0027d donned my gold crown for the trip to the Rowan Land, and my men regarded me with adoration, calling out cheers for their brave, all-powerful queen. What would they do if they knew? I wondered. What would they do if they knew I was carrying a potential warlord? Somehow, it wasn\u0027t much of a mystery. They would cheer more. They would worship me and revel in the chance to extend our rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me eager to go to the Rowan Land, where I was feared rather than adored. Of course, I didn\u0027t know if that was any better. If those people knew I was carrying Storm King\u0027s grandchild, it would simply intensify their fear and convince them more than ever that they were under the control of a tyrant queen. Kiyo was right, I realized. No one in the Otherworld could know about my pregnancy. Any reaction it drew would be a powerful one. The sooner I could leave, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorrowed soldiers from the Thorn Land still made up the bulk of the guard at Katrice\u0027s former castle, and their expressions mirrored those of their colleagues back home. I played the part, smiling and walking among them confidently, not daring to show the fear and uncertainty I felt. Like the Thorn Land\u0027s, the Rowan Land\u0027s energy buzzed around me. Only I felt it, of course, but once, when I paused and talked to a guard for several minutes, I saw a small red flower growing where I\u0027d stood. No one noticed, and I hastily headed for the castle, figuring nothing would sprout out of stone walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik greeted us happily, having already known about Shaya\u0027s new position. As we all converged, I saw something flash between them, something that surprised me. Affection. More than friendly affection. It was then that I also noticed a bracelet Shaya wore, made of emeralds and pearls. I\u0027d seen it before. Girard had been working on it when I first met Imanuelle. It was the piece Rurik had commissioned. I tried not to gape as the truth hit me. Shaya and Rurik. They had a relationship going on, some romance, probably one that had been building right before me that I\u0027d been too oblivious to notice. That was why she hadn\u0027t minded taking on stewardship of a kingdom conquered through unorthodox means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else seemed to notice - or maybe everyone already knew about them - but as I stood there and listened to more debriefings, I felt a pang in my chest. It was like Tim and Lara - and not because both couples were so bizarrely matched. No, the similarities came in that it was so easy for all of them. Just fall in love and go with it. No political machinations and motives. No world-altering prophecies to muck things up. I\u0027d untangled myself from Dorian\u0027s scheming - and not without a fair amount of heartache - but things with Kiyo now were irrevocably altered. No matter how my pregnancy panned out, even if it had as happy an ending as it could, I knew things between him and me would never be the same. I would never have an easy relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueasiness welled up in me, and I didn\u0027t bother trying to figure out which of the myriad reasons could be causing it. I leaned against the wall as Rurik continued speaking about troop placement. Even though it wasn\u0027t part of the land, the wall and castle\u0027s foundation touched the land, and I felt that magic warm and comfort me. I took a deep breath. I could do this. Everything would be all right, just as I\u0027d told Kiyo. I\u0027d know my child\u0027s gender soon. Then I\u0027d know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy intention had been to stay around longer and make sure Shaya was settled in, but I soon decided I needed to get back. The others looked like they would have liked me to stay a little longer too, but they were also used to my weird - or as they considered them, \"human\" - ways. I assured them all that I had the utmost faith in them, reminded Shaya to rebuke Dorian, and then headed back to Tucson as soon as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived home and analyzed how I\u0027d been feeling today, it occurred to me that the transitions from world to world were making me sick. Transitioning wasn\u0027t an easy feat in general; some couldn\u0027t even do it. I\u0027d grown adept at it, but now, it took its toll, even with the help of a gateway. I understood enough about pregnancy to know these annoying symptoms only lasted for a short time, but that didn\u0027t negate their annoyance. I didn\u0027t want anything slowing me down. I didn\u0027t want to be hampered. My body was turning against me, and Kiyo\u0027s urging just to end the pregnancy began to seem like a better and better idea. What did gender matter? I wasn\u0027t ready for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was relieved to see me back early and wrapped me up in another big embrace. \"Everything\u0027s okay?\" he asked in a low voice. \"Nobody found out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"No. And I\u0027m not going back until ... until this is settled. I\u0027m also starting to think ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you were right. That gender doesn\u0027t matter. The test is so close, though ... I\u0027ll still do it. But. Well. Like I said, it doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief flooded his features. \"I\u0027m glad, Eug. It\u0027s the right thing to do.\" He hugged me again, and the hug was filled with more intensity. \"You can always cancel the test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll do it. Especially after the fit I threw with my poor doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could go with you,\" he said wistfully. \"But I\u0027m not sure I can. I\u0027m taking a couple of work shifts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you? Or are you running off to Maiwenn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" I said. \"You wouldn\u0027t be able to find out anything that day anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ll let me know the moment you know?\" he asked, staring at me hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The very moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo might not have been able to go with me ... but Jasmine did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOstensibly, I told myself it was because she couldn\u0027t be left by herself. Yet, deep inside, when I really looked at my heart, I knew the truth. I didn\u0027t want to go through this alone. I knew what the test entailed, and even if we got no answers today, it was still one step closer to what could be a huge event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it, you know,\" Jasmine told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d let her come into the exam room with me. It was dimly lit for the ultrasound equipment, and the doctor and tech had stepped out so I could change. Undressing in front of Jasmine felt weird, so I kept my back to her as I put on the hospital gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what? This test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I mean, yeah, whatever, you\u0027ll be fine. But I mean, have the baby. Whatever it is. Even a boy. You can fulfill our father\u0027s prophecy.\" There was a zeal in her voice I hadn\u0027t heard in a while - one I\u0027d hoped had gone away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowned, I turned around. \"No. That\u0027s out of the question. If it\u0027s a boy ... well, I can\u0027t have it. End of story. A girl ... I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m probably not doing that either.\" I couldn\u0027t help adding, \"Besides, I thought you wanted to be the heir\u0027s mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was deadly earnest as she considered my words. \"I did. But maybe I\u0027m not meant to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff returned and situated me on the examining table while Jasmine retreated to a corner. They introduced themselves: Dr. Sartori and Veronica the tech. They explained the procedure to me, though I\u0027d already read up on it several times. The doctor was going to - ack - stick a giant needle in me to collect cells and would use ultrasound to guide him. He made sure I understood the risk of such a test. A small percentage of women miscarried. Dryly, I told him I was willing to accept that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeronica raised the gown to bare my stomach. As she rubbed gel on it, I stared down wonderingly. Honestly? It looked no different than in the past. I\u0027d always been skinny, and with my lack of appetite, I probably wasn\u0027t putting on much weight. If not for my symptoms and Dr. Moore\u0027s \"very accurate\" test, I never would have guessed what was inside me. And what was inside me? My stomach took on a strange, sinister countenance. Again, I had that feeling of my body\u0027s betrayal. It was doing things out of my control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Veronica, moving the paddle to my stomach. \"Let\u0027s take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth she and Dr. Sartori watched a black monitor that had my name, birthday, and a few other stats at the bottom of the screen. When the paddle made contact, the screen flared to life, showing the indecipherable gray and white confusion I\u0027d always seen when people had ultrasounds on TV. I could make no sense of it nor see anything resembling a baby, but sound immediately accompanied the images, repetitive swishing noises, kind of like waves. I at least knew what that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the heartbeat, isn\u0027t it?\" I asked, a strange feeling crawling over me. Heartbeat. Another creature\u0027s heart inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither practitioner answered right away. Dr. Sartori frowned curiously, and Veronica shifted the paddle around to get more views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" said the doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I exclaimed. Two immediate possibilities sprang to mind. One was that my gentry blood mixing with Kiyo\u0027s kitsune blood had created some sort of monster. The other thought - one that suddenly offered a world of safety - was that there had been a mistake. The test wasn\u0027t accurate, and I actually wasn\u0027t pregnant. \"Isn\u0027t that the heartbeat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Sartori\u0027s gaze fell on me, a small smile on his lips. \"That\u0027s the heartbeats. You have twins.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-21.html","bookId":2040,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM"}
