The battle obviously had been fought in some other realm. But what was that realm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, if only I could find David. I had less than three hours before the winter dawn and set off at once to search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, being unable to read David\u0027s mind, or to call to him, I had but one telepathic tool at my command, and that was to scan the minds of mortals at random for some image of David as he passed in some recognizable place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t walked three blocks when I realized that not only was I picking up a strong image of David, but that it was coming to me from the mind of another vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, and tried with my entire soul to make some eloquent contact. Within seconds, the pair acknowledged me, David through the one who stood beside him, and I saw and recognized the wooded place where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my days, the Bayou Road had led through this area into country, and it had been very near here once that Claudia and Louis, having attempted my murder, had left my remains in the waters of the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the area was a great combed park, filled by day, I supposed, with mothers and children, containing a museum of occasionally very interesting paintings, and providing in the dark of night a dense wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome, of the oldest oaks of New Orleans lay within the bounds of this area, and a lovely lagoon, long, serpentine, seemingly endless, wound under a picturesque bridge in the heart of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found them there, the two vampires communing with one another in dense darkness, far from the beaten path. David was as I expected, his usual properly attired self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sight of the other astonished me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Armand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the stone park bench, boylike, casual, with one knee crooked, looking up at me with the predictable innocence, dusty all over, naturally, hair a long, tangled mess of auburn curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in heavy denim garments, tight pants, and a zippered jacket, he surely passed for human, a street vagabond maybe, though his face was now parchment white, and even smoother than it had been when last we met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way, he made me think of a child doll, with brilliant faintly red-brown glass eyes\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;a doll that had been found in an attic. I wanted to polish him with kisses, clean him up, make him even more radiant than he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you always want,\" he said softly. His voice shocked me. If he had any French or Italian accent left, I couldn\u0027t hear it. His tone was melancholy and had no meanness in it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you found me under Les Innocents,\" he said, \"you wanted to bathe me with perfume and dress me in velvet with great embroidered sleeves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, \"and comb your hair, your beautiful russet hair.\" My tone was angry. \"You look good to me, you damnable little devil, good to embrace and good to love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eyed each other for a moment. And then he surprised me, rising and coming towards me just as I moved to take him in my arms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His gesture wasn\u0027t tentative, but it was extremely gentle. I could have backed away. I didn\u0027t. We held each other tight for a moment. The cold embracing the cold. The hard embracing the hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cherub child,\" I said. I did a bold thing, maybe even a defiant thing. I reached out and mussed his snaggled curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is smaller than me physically, but he didn\u0027t seem to mind this gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he smiled, shook his head, and reclaimed his hair with a few casual strokes of his hand. His cheeks went apple-perfect suddenly, and his mouth softened, and then he lifted his right fist, and teasingly struck me hard on the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally hard. Show-off. Now it was my turn to smile and I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t remember anything bad between us,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will,\" he responded. \"And so will I. But what does it matter what we remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, \"we\u0027re both still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed outright, though it was very low, and he shook his head, flashing a glance on David that implied they knew each other very well, maybe too well. I didn\u0027t like it that they knew each other at all. David was my David, and Armand was my Armand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down on the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So David\u0027s told you the whole story,\" I said, glancing up at Armand and then over at David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid gave a negative shake of the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without your permission, Brat Prince,\" David said, a little disdainfully. \"I would never have taken the liberty. But the only thing that\u0027s brought Armand here is worry for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" I said. I raised my eyebrows. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damned good and well it is,\" said Armand. His whole posture was casual; he\u0027d learned, beating about the world, I guess. He didn\u0027t look so much like a church ornament anymore. He had his hands in his pockets. Little tough guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re looking for trouble again,\" he went on, in the same slow manner, without anger or meanness. \"The whole wide world isn\u0027t enough for you and never will be. This time I thought I\u0027d try to speak to you before the wheel turns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the most thoughtful of guardian angels?\" I said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am,\" he said without so much as blinking. \"So what are you doing, want to let me know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, I want to go deeper into the park,\" I said, and they both followed me as we walked at a mortal pace into a thicket of the oldest oaks, where the grass was high and neglected, and not even the most desperate homeless heart would seek to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made our own small clearing, among the volcanic black roots and rather cool winter earth. The breeze from the nearby lake was brisk and clean, and for a moment there seemed little scent of New Orleans, of any city; we three were together, and Armand asked again: \"Will you tell me what you\u0027re doing?\" He bent close to me, and suddenly kissed me, in a manner that seemed entirely childlike and also a bit European. \"You\u0027re in deep trouble. Come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone knows it.\" The steel buttons of his denim jacket were icy cold, as though he had come from some far worse winter in a very few moments of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are never entirely sure about each other\u0027s powers. It\u0027s all a game. I would no more have asked him how he got here, or in what manner, than I would ask a mortal man how precisely he made love to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him a long time, conscious that David had settled down on the grass, leaning back on his elbow, and was studying us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I spoke: \"The Devil has come to me and asked me to go with him, to see Heaven and Hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmand didn\u0027t answer. Then he frowned just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the same Devil,\" said I, \"which I told you I didn\u0027t believe in, when you did believe in him centuries ago. You were right at least on one point. He exists. I\u0027ve met him.\" I looked at David. \"He wants me as his assistant. He\u0027s given me tonight and tomorrow night to seek advice from others. He will take me to Heaven and then to Hell.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He claims he is not evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid looked off into the darkness. Armand simply stared at me, rapt and silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went on. I told them everything then. I repeated the story of Roger for Armand, and of Roger\u0027s ghost, and then I told them both in detail about my blundering visit to Dora, about my exchanges with her, and how I\u0027d left her, and then how the Devil had come pursuing me and annoying me, and we\u0027d had our brawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put down every detail. I opened my mind, without calculation, letting Armand see whatever he could for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I sat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say things to me that are humiliating,\" I averred. \"Don\u0027t ask me why I fled from Dora, or blurted out to her all this about her father. I can\u0027t get rid of the presence of Roger, the sense of Roger\u0027s friendship for me and love for her. And this Memnoch the Devil, this is a reasonable and mild-mannered individual, and very convincing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;As for the battle, I don\u0027t know what happened, except I gave him something to think about. In two nights, he\u0027s coming back, and if memory serves me correctly, which it invariably does, he said he\u0027d come for me wherever I was at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s clear,\" Armand said sotto voce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t enjoying my misery, are you?\" I admitted with a little sigh of defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not,\" Armand said, \"only, as usual, you don\u0027t really seem miserable. You\u0027re on the verge of an adventure, and just a little more cautious this time than when you let that mortal run off with your body and you took his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not more cautious. Terrified. I think this creature, Memnoch, is the Devil. If you had seen the visions, you would think he was the Devil too. I\u0027m not talking about spellbinding. You can do spellbinding, Armand, you\u0027ve done it to me. I was battling that thing. It has some essence which can inhabit actual bodies! It\u0027s objective and bodiless itself, of that I\u0027m sure. The rest? Maybe all that was spells. He implied he could make spells and so could I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re describing an angel, of course,\" said David offhandedly, \"and this one claims to be a fallen angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Devil himself,\" mused Armand. \"What are you asking of us, Lestat? You are asking our advice? I would not go with this spirit of my own will, if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you say this?\" David asked before I could get out a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, we know there are earthbound beings,\" Armand said, \"that we ourselves can\u0027t classify, or locate, or control. We know there are species of immortals, and types of mammalian creatures which look human but are not. This creature might be anything. And there is something highly suspicious in the manner in which he courts you ... the visions, and then the politeness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either that,\" said David, \"or it simply makes perfect sense. He is the Devil, he is reasonable, the way you always supposed, Lestat\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;not a moral idiot, but a true angel, and he wants your cooperation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He doesn\u0027t want to keep doing things to you by force. He\u0027s used force as his introduction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would not believe him,\" said Armand. \"What does this mean\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;he wants you to help him? That you would begin to exist simultaneously on this earth and in Hell? No, I would shun him for his imagery, if nothing else, for his vocabulary. For his name. Memnoch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It sounds evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all these are things,\" I admitted, \"that I once said, more or less, to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen the Prince of Darkness with my own eyes,\" said Armand. \"I\u0027ve seen centuries of superstition, and the wonders done by demonic beings such as ourselves. You\u0027ve seen a little more than I have. But you\u0027re right. That is what you told me before and I\u0027m telling it to you now. Don\u0027t believe in the Devil, or that you are his child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is what I told Louis, once when he came to me seeking explanations of God and the universe. I believe in no Devil. So I remind you. Don\u0027t believe him. Turn your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for Dora,\" said David quietly, \"you\u0027ve acted unwisely, but it\u0027s possible that that breach of preternatural decorum can somehow be healed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me ask you both ... do you believe what I\u0027m telling you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re telling the truth,\" said Armand, \"but I told you, I don\u0027t believe this creature is the Devil himself or that he will take you to Heaven or Hell. And very frankly, if it is true ... well, that\u0027s all the more reason perhaps that you shouldn\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him for a long moment, fighting the darkness I had deliberately sought, trying to draw from him some impression of his complete disposition on this, and I realized he was sincere. There was no envy in him, or old grudge against me; there was no hurt, or trickery, or anything. He was past all these things, if ever they had obsessed him. Perhaps they\u0027d been fantasies of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps so,\" he said, answering my thoughts directly. \"But you are correct in that I am speaking to you directly and truly, and I tell you, I would not trust this creature, or trust the proposition that you must in some way verbally cooperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A medieval concept of pact,\" said David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means what?\" I asked. I hadn\u0027t meant it to be so rude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making a pact with the Devil,\" said David, \"you know, agreeing to something with him. That\u0027s what Armand is telling you not to do.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Don\u0027t make a pact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely,\" said Armand. \"It arouses my deepest suspicions that he makes such a moral issue of your agreement.\" His young face was sorely troubled, his pretty eyes very vivid for a second in the shadows.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Why do you have to agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s on the mark or not,\" I said. I was confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re right. I said something to him myself, something about this being played by rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk with you about Dora,\" said David in a low voice.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"You must heal what you\u0027ve done there very quickly, or at least promise us that you won\u0027t. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to promise you anything about Dora. I can\u0027t,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat, don\u0027t destroy this young mortal woman!\" said David forcefully. \"If we are in a new realm, if the spirits of the dead can plead with us, then maybe they can hurt us, have you ever thought of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid sat up, disconcerted, angry, the lovely British voice straining to maintain decency as he spoke: \"Don\u0027t hurt the mortal girl. Her father asked you for a species of guardianship, not that you shake her sanity to the foundations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David, don\u0027t go on with your speech. I know what you\u0027re saying.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But I tell you right now, I am alone in this. I am alone. I am alone with this being Memnoch, the Devil; and you both have been friends to me. You\u0027ve been kindred. But I don\u0027t think anyone can advise me what to do, except for Dora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dora!\" David was aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean to tell her this entire tale?\" Armand asked timidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. That\u0027s exactly what I mean to do. Dora\u0027s the only one who believes in the Devil. Dear God, I need a believer right now, I need a saint, and I may need a theologian, and to Dora I\u0027m going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are perverse, stubborn, and innately destructive!\" said David. It had the tone of a curse. \"You will do what you will!\" He was furious. I could see it. All his reasons for despising me were being heated from within, and there really was nothing I could say in my defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" said Armand with gentleness. \"Lestat, this is mad. It\u0027s like consulting the Sibyl. You want the girl to act as an oracle for you, to tell you what she, a mortal, thinks you must do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s no mere mortal, she\u0027s different. She has no fear of me whatsoever. None. And she has no fear of anything. It\u0027s as though she\u0027s a different species, but she\u0027s the human species. She\u0027s like a saint, Armand. She\u0027s like Joan of Arc must have been when she led the army. She knows something about God and the Devil that I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking about faith, and it\u0027s very alluring,\" said David, \"just as it was with your nun companion, Gretchen, who is now stark raving mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stark mutely mad,\" I said. \"She doesn\u0027t say anything but prayers, or so say the papers. But before I came along, Gretchen didn\u0027t really believe in God, keep that in mind. Belief and madness, for Gretchen, are one and the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you never learn!\" said David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Learn what?\" I asked. \"David, I\u0027m going to Dora. She\u0027s the only person I can go to. And besides, I can\u0027t leave things with her as I did!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to go back, and I am going back. Now from you, Armand, a promise, the obvious thing. Around this Dora, I\u0027ve thrown a protective light. None of us can touch her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That goes without saying. I won\u0027t hurt your little friend. You wound me.\" He looked genuinely put out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I know. But I know what blood is and innocence and how delicious both can be. I know how much the girl tempts me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you must be the one to give in to that temptation,\" said Armand crossly. \"I never choose my victims anymore, you know this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I can stand before a house as always, and out of the doors will come those who want to be in my arms. Of course I won\u0027t hurt her. You do hold old grudges. You think I live in the past. You don\u0027t understand that I actually change with every era, I always have as best I can. But what in the world can Dora tell you that will help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"But I\u0027m going directly tomorrow night.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If there were time left, I\u0027d go now. I\u0027m going to her. David, if something happens to me, if I vanish, if I ... you have all Dora\u0027s inheritance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You have my word of honor on the girl\u0027s best interests, but you must not go to her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat, if you need me\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;\" Armand said. \"If this being tries to take you by force!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you care about me?\" I asked. \"After all the bad things I did to you? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t be such a fool,\" he begged gently. \"You convinced me long ago that the world was a Savage Garden. Remember your old poetry? You said the only laws that were true were aesthetic laws, that was all you could count on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I remember all that. I fear it\u0027s true. I\u0027ve always feared it was true. I feared it when I was a mortal child. I woke up one morning and I believed in nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, in the Savage Garden,\" said Armand, \"you shine beautifully, my friend. You walk as if it is your garden to do with as you please. And in my wanderings, I always return to you. I always return to see the colors of the garden in your shadow, or reflected in your eyes, perhaps, or to hear of your latest follies and mad obsessions. Besides, we are brothers, are we not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you help me last time, when I was in all that trouble, having switched bodies with a human being?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t forgive me if I tell you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I hoped and prayed for you, that you would remain in that mortal body and save your soul. I thought you had been granted the greatest gift, that you were human again, my heart ached for your triumph! I couldn\u0027t interfere. I couldn\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a child and a fool, you always were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Well, it looks like you\u0027re being given another chance to do something with your soul. You\u0027d best be at your very strongest and most resourceful, Lestat. I distrust this Memnoch, far worse than any human foe you faced when you were trapped in the flesh. This Memnoch sounds very far from Heaven. Why should they let you in with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat,\" said David, \"don\u0027t go to Dora. Will you remember that my advice last time might have saved you misery!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, there was too much to comment on there, for his advice might have prevented him from ever being what he was now, in this fine form, and I could not, I could not regret that he was here, that he had won the Body Thief\u0027s fleshly trophy. I couldn\u0027t. I just couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can believe the Devil wants you,\" said Armand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t go to Dora,\" said David seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to, and it\u0027s almost morning now. I love you both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them were staring at me, perplexed, suspicious, uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did the only thing I could. I left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-9.html","bookId":2213,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:37 PM"}
