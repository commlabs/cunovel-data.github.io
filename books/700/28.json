I always punish severely when I find that out. In this case, though, I had no proof; Mallory would say nothing, though he was within five demerits of expulsion. So I decided to end the whole matter by declaring a new rule I\u0027ve been contemplating for some time. I\u0027ve found that new cadets get too many demerits during the first few weeks, before they learn the rules thoroughly. So I\u0027ve decided that in future no demerits shall be given for the first three weeks, and that delinquencies shall be punished by extra hours and other penalties.
