{"id":84738,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you from?\" I ask, curious suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kansas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"Well duh. I know Kansas. I mean where were you fighting when he found you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wichita.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s from Kansas too?\" I\u0027m confused? \"What was he doing at a boxing match in Wichita?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns and pulls the car into the parking lot of the doctor, \"Not a clue.\" He hops out and gets the door. I look up into his beautiful eyes, \"A hundred thousand a year and you never questioned it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I was making thirty fighting and fifteen at the gym as a trainer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk away from them and pull my sweater tighter around me. None of this makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the office feels like the door to Sebastian\u0027s building. I miss him in sick and twisted ways. Selfish ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door with the gloved hand. The only thing I love about winter, wearing gloves. Gloves in the summer make my hands sweaty, which freaks me out more. But gloves in the winter are my new saving grace. Gloves and Michelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the button on the elevator in a series of taps and take a deep breath. When the elevator dings and the door opens, her smiling face is there for me. She never makes me ride it alone. It\u0027s his orders. I like it though. I don’t like elevators alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you this week?\" She asks, as I step inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay. How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe presses the button and nods, \"Excellent, thank you.\" When the door closes she turns, \"He\u0027s phoned only a few moments ago. He\u0027s terribly worried. Is there some stuff you don’t want to talk about, that maybe you should?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator stops at her apartment. We walk out into the huge open space. I hate it. It\u0027s too open and too white and too bright. I feel like I am under a microscope here and she can see all the fine details I try to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the chair, where I always sit. It\u0027s the one with the back to the wall. I don’t like chairs with their backs near windows or doors and god forbid it, open space. I shake my head and fidget with my fingers, \"I\u0027m doing good. I don’t know what he\u0027s talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits and sips from the glass of water she has. She always sets me out one as well. It always has a cucumber slice in it and looks refreshing, as always, I\u0027ve yet to drink it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is under the impression you\u0027ve had a bad break up. You\u0027re depressed a bit from it.\" Her dark-blue eyes and dark shiny hair shimmer in the extreme light. The light that makes me feel exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn it I can see her better though. She is mid forties and pretty, but like a mom. She reminds me of Michelle\u0027s mom. Pretty and clean. Only Michelle\u0027s mom always smells like food. I can remember the millions of hugs that smelled like spaghetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems to think you are upset about the young man. Sebastian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue to ignore her. I refuse for her to see that side of my soul. The dirty side. \"There is something I want to talk about. My benefactor, I think he\u0027s a bad man. He\u0027s paying a hundred grand to Stuart to be my driver. Who does that? He hired him from a gym. He could be a serial killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crosses her arms, \"So you wish to discuss the possible previous career choices Stuart has made? Or that the man paying for you to get better, could be a bad man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I\u0027m going to bet mafia of some sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fidget my fingers, \"Can we do the grateful thing again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs, \"Avoiding the conversation isn’t going to make it go away. You know you’re safe in here. Let\u0027s talk about the relationship. Do you feel like it was a wise choice, considering your feelings about people and proximity? Did you tell him everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snap, \"What everything? My holey memory about a creepy house, blue eyes in a dirty hole and a dead girl on a bed? What am I supposed to do with that? Oh right there was also a gunshot. Useful stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lip plays with a grin, \"Nice. I like that question. What do you think the answer is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to toss something. I might snap her head off if she asks me one more thing. I squeeze my hands in a ball. My nails are short, always. They don’t leave indents but my fingertips start to get numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you have been to the bar a few times. How was that? Seems like a big step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my lips together and take in big breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you self calming?\" She asks and sips from the water again. I watch my glass. I\u0027m so thirsty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide I can play along with her. I shrug, \"It was fun. The dancing was fun. I didn’t like being around so many people, but they never really noticed me. So I felt invisible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and watches me. \"Did you drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sip of beer a few times. Nothing crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you buy the beer?\" Her tone puzzles me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Shell did. She bought the beer and gave it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrow. She sips the water again. I think she\u0027s doing it loudly to make me want some. \"Was the lid off the beer when you got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown and nod, \"It was.\" How did I not notice that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you dance?\" She changes the subject quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s some progress I think.\" Her voice lifts. I grin, I love her approval. Like the nuns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now the guy you met, was he there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. My smile fades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you break up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words pop out, \"I can\u0027t be that girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t or won\u0027t?\" She doesn’t miss a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. Her eyes sparkle. \"If you want to change and one day be free of it all, it matters. If you want to have a real relationship one day, of course it matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down. I need to change the subject. \"I don’t sleep much anymore. If Michelle isn’t there I don’t sleep. He asked me to tell you that.\" I\u0027m dreading where she will take that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits back on the chair, getting more relaxed. \"Okay. What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before it was just the first night somewhere new. Now it seems to be all the time. It seems to be worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drags her long slender finger with a French tipped manicure back and forth along the armrest, \"Since the breakup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. I\u0027m close to her. I trust her. I relax and take a breath and remind myself of these things. She isn’t the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He broke up with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so sad if you broke it off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh bitterly, it\u0027s almost a sob. \"I couldn’t be with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sexually?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word makes my skin crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to talk about the house you\u0027ve mentioned before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost crawl backwards up the chair, \"NO!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts a delicate hand out, \"Calm. Be grateful for the moments that matter. You are breathing air and are alive and the room is clean and free of germs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a breath but my skin won\u0027t stop crawling and shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So sexually you can\u0027t be with him? Is it possible you feel guilty for wanting to?\" I\u0027m up and walking for the door, \"Thanks doc.\" I press the elevator. It opens instantly. She knows better than to chase me. The door dings. I walk across the foyer and out into the cool breeze. Michelle and Stuart are kissing in the front seat. I turn left instead of going to the car. I don’t want to disrupt them. I have my wallet and phone. If I get desperate I\u0027ll call a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stroll down the driveway and out onto the street. The air is cold and crisp, it makes me feel clean. Well clean-ish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates. I pull it out and answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks before I can, \"Why did you leave the car?\" He is moody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can be moody too, \"Why did you hire Stuart for a hundred thousand a year to drive me around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heaves a sigh, \"He has a big mouth and my business with him is private. That just cost him his pay for a month. Why did you leave the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scream into the phone, \"HOW DO YOU KNOW I LEFT THE CAR? WHERE ARE YOU? YOU FUCKING FREAK! STOP SPYING ON ME!\" I\u0027m trembling and at my breaking point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you finished?\" He is calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dry sob and feel badly for calling him a freak. It\u0027s a glass house moment I\u0027m not proud of. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you leave the car?\" He is so calm it scares me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"Why did you hire a boxing UFC champ as my driver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs with me but says nothing. He is silent. I wait for it and then sigh. I am defeated. \"I wanted to be alone. She made me feel dirty. I didn’t want to be with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I am a rich man and if anyone ever knew that you were my ward, they would hurt you to get to me. I need to know you\u0027re alright. At all times. Stuart can protect you. I cannot. I am busy.\" I am a burden suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have anything to add to that. How can I be so angry that he wants to keep me safe? At all times. And I am a burden that costs him a fortune. I pause, \"What? Wait…who wants to hurt you and me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My business.\" His tone is getting edgy. I don’t even want to know what he\u0027s talking about. I don’t need new reasons to not sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinch the bridge of my nose and take a deep breath. \"Can you find Sebastian for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to tell him that I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s killing me inside that I made him feel so awful.\" I don’t say that he is the only normal thing in my life and I need him. That I made a terrible mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is dead calm again, \"Do you love him?\" I spin around and look for him. He must be watching me. I shake my head, \"I don’t think I\u0027m capable of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the car. He\u0027s gone. He\u0027s hung up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and see Stuart. He looks savagely angry. He gets out and opens the door to the car in a rough jerk. Shell is scowling at me. I sigh, and climb in defeated. They don’t speak to me, or each other. When we drive up, Stuart doesn’t get out of the car. He doesn’t move his head. He looks straight ahead. I climb out. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve opened my own door. I feel sick. I\u0027m a moron. I know this. I walk up the stairs to the dorm. Shell stays behind in the car. I don’t have to look back. I don’t hear her door. I walk inside and feel the lump in my throat growing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-13.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
