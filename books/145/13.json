{"id":4250,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"\u003cp\u003eI was so proud and light-hearted all that day, I so vividly retained on my face the feeling of Zina?da’s kisses, with such a shudder of delight I recalled every word she had uttered, I so hugged my unexpected happiness that I felt positively afraid, positively unwilling to see her, who had given rise to these new sensations. It seemed to me that now I could ask nothing more of fate, that now I ought to ‘go, and draw a deep last sigh and die.’ But, next day, when I went into the lodge, I felt great embarrassment, which I tried to conceal under a show of modest confidence, befitting a man who wishes to make it apparent that he knows how to keep a secret. Zina?da received me very simply, without any emotion, she simply shook her finger at me and asked me, whether I wasn’t black and blue? All my modest confidence and air of mystery vanished instantaneously and with them my embarrassment. Of course, I had not expected anything particular, but Zina?da’s composure was like a bucket of cold water thrown over me. I realised that in her eyes I was a child, and was extremely miserable! Zina?da walked up and down the room, giving me a quick smile, whenever she caught my eye, but her thoughts were far away, I saw that clearly. . . . ‘Shall I begin about what happened yesterday myself,’ I pondered; ‘ask her, where she was hurrying off so fast, so as to find out once for all’ . . . but with a gesture of despair, I merely went and sat down in a corner.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eByelovzorov came in; I felt relieved to see him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ve not been able to find you a quiet horse,’ he said in a sulky voice; ‘Freitag warrants one, but I don’t feel any confidence in it, I am afraid.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What are you afraid of?’ said Zina?da; ‘allow me to inquire?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What am I afraid of? Why, you don’t know how to ride. Lord save us, what might happen! What whim is this has come over you all of a sudden?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Come, that’s my business, Sir Wild Beast. In that case I will ask Piotr Vassilievitch.’ . . . (My father’s name was Piotr Vassilievitch. I was surprised at her mentioning his name so lightly and freely, as though she were confident of his readiness to do her a service.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, indeed,’ retorted Byelovzorov, ‘you mean to go out riding with him then?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘With him or with some one else is nothing to do with you. Only not with you, anyway.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not with me,’ repeated Byelovzorov. ‘As you wish. Well, I shall find you a horse.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, only mind now, don’t send some old cow. I warn you I want to gallop.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Gallop away by all means . . . with whom is it, with Malevsky, you are going to ride?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘And why not with him, Mr. Pugnacity? Come, be quiet,’ she added, ‘and don’t glare. I’ll take you too. You know that to my mind now Malevsky’s — ugh!’ She shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You say that to console me,’ growled Byelovzorov.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eZina?da half closed her eyes. ‘Does that console you? O . . . O . . . O . . . Mr. Pugnacity!’ she said at last, as though she could find no other word. ‘And you, M’sieu’ Voldemar, would you come with us?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t care to . . . in a large party,’ I muttered, not raising my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You prefer a tête-à-tête? . . . Well, freedom to the free, and heaven to the saints,’ she commented with a sigh. ‘Go along, Byelovzorov, and bestir yourself. I must have a horse for tomorrow.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, and where’s the money to come from?’ put in the old princess.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eZina?da scowled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I won’t ask you for it; Byelovzorov will trust me.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘He’ll trust you, will he?’ . . . grumbled the old princess, and all of a sudden she screeched at the top of her voice, ‘Duniashka!’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Maman, I have given you a bell to ring,’ observed Zina?da.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Duniashka!’ repeated the old lady.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eByelovzorov took leave; I went away with him. Zina?da did not try to detain me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795/4776.html","bookId":145,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:14:10 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:14:10 AM"}
