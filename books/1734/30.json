She peeled off her gloves, put her hat away, and turned her brightening eyes upon her husband. \u0027f\\\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Drake, we\u0027re going to have him here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake looked at her with annoyance. \"You\u0027ve missed supper. 1 thought you were going to be back by seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that doesn\u0027t matter. I ate something on the way home. But, Drake, we\u0027re going to have him here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who here? What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor from Hawkin\u0027s Planet! Didn\u0027t you realize that was what today\u0027s conference was about? We spent all day talking about it. It\u0027s the most exciting thing that could possibly have happened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake Smollett removed the pipe from the vicinity of his face. He stared first at it and then at his wife. \"Let me get this straight. When you say the doctor from Hawkin\u0027s Planet, do you mean the Hawkinsite you\u0027ve got at the Institute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course. Who else could I possibly mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And may I ask what the devil you mean by saying we\u0027ll have him here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drake, don\u0027t you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is there to understand? Your Institute may be interested in the thing, but I\u0027m not. What have we to do with it personally? It\u0027s Institute business, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, darling,\" Rose said, patiently, \"the Hawkinsite would like to stay at a private house somewhere, where he won\u0027t be bothered with official ceremony, and where he\u0027ll be able to proceed more according to his own likes and dislikes. I find it quite understandable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why at our house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because our place is convenient for the purpose, I suppose. They asked if I would allow it, and frankly,\" she added with some stiffness, \"I consider it a privilege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look!\" Drake put his fingers through his brown hair and succeeded in rumpling it. \"We\u0027ve got a convenient little place here-granted! It\u0027s not the most elegant place in the world, but it does well enough for us. However, I don\u0027t see where we\u0027ve got room for extraterrestrial visitors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose began to look worried. She removed her glasses and put them away in their case. \"He can stay in the spare room. He\u0027ll take care of it himself. I\u0027ve spoken to him and he\u0027s very pleasant. Honestly, all we have to do is show a certain amount of adaptability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"Sure, just a little adaptability! The Hawkinsites breathe cyanide. We\u0027ll just adapt ourselves to that, I suppose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He carries cyanide in a little cylinder. You won\u0027t even notice it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what else about them that I won\u0027t notice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing else. They\u0027re perfectly harmless. Goodness, they\u0027re even vegetarians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what does that mean? Do we feed him a bale of hay for dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose\u0027s lower lip trembled. \"Drake, you\u0027re being deliberately hateful. There are many vegetarians on Earth; they don\u0027t eat hay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about us? Do we eat meat ourselves or will that make us look like cannibals to him? I won\u0027t live on salads to suit him; I warn you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being quite ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose felt helpless. She had married late in life, comparatively. Her career had been chosen; she herself had seemed well settled in it. She was a fellow in biology at the Jenkins Institute for the Natural Sciences, with over twenty publications to her credit. In a word, the line was hewed, the path cleared; she had been set for a career and spinsterhood. And now, at thirty-five, she was still a little amazed to find herself a bride of less than a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, it embarrassed her, too, since she sometimes found that she had not the slightest idea of how to handle her husband. What did one do when the man of the family became mulish? That was not included in any of her courses. As a woman of independent mind and career, she couldn\u0027t bring herself to cajolery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she looked at him steadily and said simply, \"It means very much to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, Drake, if he stays here for any length of time, I can study him really closely. Very little work has been done on the biology and psychology of the individual Hawkinsite or of any of the extraterrestrial intelligences\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have some of their sociology and history, of course, but that\u0027s all. Surely, you must see the opportunity. He stays here; we watch him, speak to him, observe his habits-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Drake, I don\u0027t understand you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to say I\u0027m not usually like this, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake was silent for a while. He seemed withdrawn and his high cheekbones and large chin were twisted and frozen into a brooding position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said finally, \"Look, I\u0027ve heard a bit about the Hawkinsites in the way of my own business. You say there have been investigations of their sociology, but not of their biology. Sure. It\u0027s because the Hawkinsites don\u0027t like to be studied as specimens any more than we would. I\u0027ve spoken to men who were in charge of security groups watching various Hawkinsite missions on Earth. The missions stay in the rooms assigned to them and don\u0027t leave for anything but the most important official business. They have nothing to do with Earthmen. It\u0027s quite obvious that they are as revolted by us as I personally am by them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, I just don\u0027t understand why this Hawkinsite at the Institute should be any different. It seems to me to be against all the rules to have him come here by himself, anyway-and to have him want to stay in an Earthman\u0027s home just puts the maraschino cherry on top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, wearily, \"This is different. I\u0027m surprised you can\u0027t understand it, Drake. He\u0027s a doctor. He\u0027s coming here in the way of medical research, and I\u0027ll grant you that he probably doesn\u0027t enjoy staying with human beings and will find us perfectly horrible. But he must stay just the same! Do you suppose human doctors enjoy going into the tropics, or that they are particularly fond of letting themselves be bitten by infected mosquitoes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said sharply, \"What\u0027s this about mosquitoes? What have they to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, nothing,\" Rose answered, surprised. \"It just came to my mind, that\u0027s all. I was thinking of Reed and his yellow-fever experiments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake shrugged. \"Well, have it your own way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Rose hesitated. \"You\u0027re not angry about this, are you?\" To her own ears she sounded unpleasantly girlish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, Rose knew, meant that he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose surveyed herself doubtfully in the full-length mirror. She had never been beautiful and was quite reconciled to the fact; so much so that it no longer mattered. Certainly, it would not matter to a being from Hawkin\u0027s Planet. What did bother her was this matter of being a hostess under the very queer circumstances of having to be tactful to an extraterrestrial crea-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eture and, at the same time, to her husband as well. She wondered which would prove the more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake was coming home late that day; he was not due for half an hour. Rose found herself inclined to believe that he had arranged that purposely in a sullen desire to leave her alone with her problem. She found herself in a state of mild resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had called her just before noon at the Institute and had asked abruptly, \"When are you taking him home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answered, curtly, \"In about three hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. What\u0027s his name? His Hawkinsite name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want to know?\" She could not keep the chill from her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s call it a small investigation of my own. After all, the thing will be in my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake, Drake, don\u0027t bring your job home with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake\u0027s voice sounded tinny and nasty in her ears. \"Why not, Rose? Isn\u0027t that exactly what you\u0027re doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, of course, so she gave him the information he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time in their married life that they had had even the semblance of a quarrel, and, as she sat there before the full-length mirror, she began to wonder if perhaps she ought not make an attempt to see his side of it. In essence, she had married a policeman. Of course he was more than simply a policeman; he was a member of the World Security Board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a surprise to her friends. The fact of the marriage itself had been the biggest surprise, but if she had decided on marriage, the attitude was, why not with another biologist? Or, if she had wanted to go afield, an anthropologist, perhaps; even a chemist; but why, of all people, a policeman? Nobody had exactly said those things, naturally, but it had been in the very atmosphere at the time of her marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had resented it then, and ever since. A man could marry whom he chose, but if a doctor of philosophy, female variety, chose to marry a man who never went past the bachelor\u0027s degree, there was shock. Why should there be? What business was it of theirs? He was handsome, in a way, intelligent, in another way, and she was perfectly satisfied with her choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet how much of this same snobbishness did she bring home with her? Didn\u0027t she always have the attitude that her own work, her biological investigations, were important, while his job was merely something to be kept within the four walls of his little office in the old U.N. buildings on the East River?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped up from her seat in agitation and, with a deep breath, decided to leave such thoughts behind her. She desperately did not want to quarrel with him. And she just wasn\u0027t going to interfere with him. She was committed to accepting the Hawkinsite as guest, but otherwise she would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elet Drake have his own way. He was making enough of a concession as it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarg Tholan was standing quietly in the middle of the living room when she came down the stairs. He was not sitting, since he was not anatomically constructed to sit. He stood on two sets of limbs placed close together, while a third pair entirely different in construction were suspended from a region that would have been the upper chest in a human being. The skin of his body was hard, glistening and ridged, while his face bore a distant resemblance to something alienly bovine. Yet he was not completely repulsive, and he wore clothes of a sort over the lower portion of his body in order to avoid offending the sensibilities of his human hosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Mrs. Smollett, I appreciate your hospitality beyond my ability to express it in your language,\" and he drooped so that his forelimbs touched the ground for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose knew this to be a gesture signifying gratitude among the beings of Hawkin\u0027s Planet. She was grateful that he spoke English as well as he did. The construction of his mouth, combined with an absence of incisors, gave a whistling sound to the sibilants. Aside from that, he might have been born on Earth for all the accent his speech showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"My husband will be home soon, and then we will eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband?\" For a moment, he said nothing more, and then added, \"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let it go. If there was one source of infinite confusion among the five intelligent races of the known Galaxy, it lay in the differences among them with regard to their sex life and the social institutions that grew around it. The concept of husband and wife, for instance, existed only on Earth. The other races could achieve a sort of intellectual understanding of what it meant, but never an emotional one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I have consulted the Institute in preparing your menu. I trust you will find nothing in it that will upset you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite blinked its eyes rapidly. Rose recalled this to be a gesture of amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Proteins are proteins, my dear Mrs. Smollett. For those trace factors which I need but are not supplied in your food, I have brought concentrates that will be most adequate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd proteins were proteins. Rose knew this to be true. Her concern for the creature\u0027s diet had been largely one of formal politeness. In the discovery of life on the planets of the outer stars, one of the most interesting generalizations that had developed was the fact that, although life could be formed on the basis of substances other than proteins-even on elements other than carbon-it remained true that the only known intelligences were proteinaceous in nature. This meant that each of the five forms of intelli-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egent life could maintain themselves over prolonged periods on the food of any of the other four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Drake\u0027s key in the door and went stiff with apprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to admit he did well. He strode in, and, without hesitation, thrust his hand out at the Hawkinsite, saying firmly, \"Good evening, Dr. Tholan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite put out his large and rather clumsy forelimb and the two, so to speak, shook hands. Rose had already gone through that procedure and knew the queer feeling of a Hawkinsite hand in her own. It had felt rough and hot and dry. She imagined that, to the Hawkinsite, her own and Drake\u0027s felt cold and slimy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time of the formal greeting, she had taken the opportunity to observe the alien hand. It was an excellent case of converging evolution. Its morphological development was entirely different from that of the human hand, yet it had brought itself into a fairly approximate similarity. There were four fingers but no thumb. Each finger had five independent ball-and-socket joints. In this way, the flexibility lost with the absence of the thumb was made up for by the almost tentacular properties of the fingers. What was even more interesting to her biologist\u0027s eyes was the fact that each Hawkinsite finger ended in a vestigial hoof, very small and, to the layman, unidentifiable as such, but clearly adapted at one time to running, just as man\u0027s had been to climbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, in friendly enough fashion, \"Are you quite comfortable, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite answered, \"Quite. Your wife has been most thoughtful in all her arrangements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you care for a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite did not answer but looked at Rose with a slight facial contortion that indicated some emotion which, unfortunately, Rose could not interpret. She said, nervously, \"On Earth there is the custom of drinking liquids which have been fortified with ethyl alcohol. We find it stimulating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. I am afraid, then, that I must decline. Ethyl alcohol would interfere most unpleasantly with my metabolism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, so it does to Earthmen, too, but I understand, Dr. Tholan,\" Drake replied. \"Would you object to my drinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake passed close to Rose on his way to the sideboard and she caught only one word. He said, \"God!\" in a tightly controlled whisper, yet he managed to put seventeen exclamation points after it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite stood at the table. His fingers were models of dexterity as they wove their way around the cutlery. Rose tried not to look at him as he ate. His wide lipless mouth split his face alarmingly as he ingested food, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein chewing, his large jaws moved disconcertingly from side to side. It was another evidence of his ungulate ancestry. Rose found herself wondering if, in the quiet of his own room, he would later chew his cud, and was then panic-stricken lest Drake get the same idea and leave the table in disgust. But Drake was taking everything quite calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I imagine, Dr. Tholan, that the cylinder at your side holds cyanide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose started. She had actually not noticed it. It was a curved metal object, something like a water canteen, that fitted flatly against the creature\u0027s skin, half-hidden behind its clothing. But, then, Drake had a policeman\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite was not in the least disconcerted. \"Quite so,\" he said, and his hoofed fingers held out a thin, flexible hose that ran up his body, its tint blending into that of his yellowish skin, and entered the corner of his wide mouth. Rose felt slightly embarrassed, as though at the display of intimate articles of clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"And does it contain pure cyanide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite humorously blinked his eyes. \"I hope you are not considering possible danger to Earthites. I know the gas is highly poisonous to you and I do not need a great deal. The gas contained in the cylinder is five per cent hydrogen cyanide, the remainder oxygen. None of it emerges except when I actually suck at the tube, and that need not be done frequently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. And you really must have the gas to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose was slightly appalled. One simply did not ask such questions without careful preparation. It was impossible to foresee where the sensitive points of an alien psychology might be. And Drake must be doing this deliberately, since he could not help realizing that he could get answers to such questions as easily from herself. Or was it that he preferred not to ask her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite remained apparently unperturbed. \"Are you not a biologist, Mr. Smollett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dr. Tholan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are in close association with Mrs. Dr. Smollett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake smile a bit. \"Yes, I am married to a Mrs. doctor, but just the same I am not a biologist; merely a minor government official. My wife\u0027s friends,\" he added, \"call me a policeman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose bit the inside of her cheek. In this case it was the Hawkinsite who had impinged upon the sensitive point of an alien psychology. On Hawkin\u0027s Planet, there was a tight caste system and intercaste associations were limited. But Drake wouldn\u0027t realize that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite turned to her. \"May I have your permission, Mrs. Smollett, to explain a little of our biochemistry to your husband? It will be dull for you, since I am sure you must understand it quite well already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"By all means do, Dr. Tholan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You see, Mr. Smollett, the respiratory system in your body and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the bodies of all air-breathing creatures on Earth is controlled by certain metal-containing enzymes, I am taught. The metal is usually iron, though sometimes it is copper. In either case, small traces of cyanide would combine with these metals and immobilize the respiratory system of the terrestrial living cell. They would be prevented from using oxygen and killed in a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The life on my own planet is not quite so constituted. The key respiratory compounds contain neither iron nor copper; no metal at all, in fact. It is for this reason that my blood is colorless. Our compounds contain certain organic groupings which are essential to life, and these groupings can only be maintained intact in the presence of a small concentration of cyanide. Undoubtedly, this type of protein has developed through millions of years of evolution on a world which has a few tenths of a per cent of hydrogen cyanide occurring naturally in the atmosphere. Its presence is maintained by a biological cycle. Various of our native micro-organisms liberate the free gas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make it extremely clear, Dr. Tholan, and very interesting,\" Drake said. \"What happens if you don\u0027t breathe it? Do you just go, like that?\" He snapped his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite. It isn\u0027t equivalent to the presence of cyanide for you. In my case, the absence of cyanide would be equivalent to slow strangulation. It happens sometimes, in ill-ventilated rooms on my world, that the cyanide is gradually consumed and falls below the minimum necessary concentration. The results are very painful and difficult to treat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose had to give Drake credit; he really sounded interested. And the alien, thank heaven, did not mind the catechism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the dinner passed without incident. It was almost pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the evening, Drake remained that way; interested. Even more than that-absorbed. He drowned her out, and she was glad of it. He was the one who was really colorful and it was only her job, her specialized training, that stole the color from him. She looked at him gloomily and thought, Why did he many me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake sat, one leg crossed over the other, hands clasped and tapping his chin gently, watching the Hawkinsite intently. The Hawkinsite faced him, standing in his quadruped fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"I find it difficult to keep thinking of you as a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite laughingly blinked his eyes. \"I understand what you mean,\" he said. \"I find it difficult to think of you as a policeman. On my world, policemen are very specialized and distinctive people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they?\" said Drake, somewhat drily, and then changed the subject. \"I gather that you are not here on a pleasure trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I am here very much on business. I intend to study this queer plane you call Earth, as it has never been studied before by any of my people.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Queer?\" asked Drake. \"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite looked at Rose. \"Does he know of the Inhibition Death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose felt embarrassed. \"His work is important,\" she said. \"I am afraid that my husband has little time to listen to the details of my work.\" She knew that this was not really adequate and she felt herself to be the recipient, yet again, of one of the Hawkinsite\u0027s unreadable emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe extraterrestrial creature turned back to Drake. \"It is always amazing to me to find how little you Earthmen understand your own unusual characteristics. Look, there are five intelligent races in the Galaxy. These have all developed independently, yet have managed to converge in remarkable fashion. It is as though, in the long run, intelligence requires a certain physical makeup to flourish. I leave that question for philosophers. But I need not belabor the point, since it must be a familiar one to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now when the differences among the intelligences are closely investigated, it is found over and over again that it is you Earthmen, more than any of the others, who are unique. For instance, it is only on Earth that life depends upon metal enzymes for respiration. Your people are the only ones which find hydrogen cyanide poisonous. Yours is the only form of intelligent life which is carnivorous. Yours is the only form of life which has not developed from a grazing animal. And, most interesting of all, yours is the only form of intelligent life known which stops growing upon reaching maturity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake grinned at him. Rose felt her heart suddenly race. It was the nicest thing about him, that grin, and he was using it perfectly naturally. It wasn\u0027t forced or false. He was adjusting to the presence of this alien creature. He was being pleasant-and he must be doing it for her. She loved that thought and repeated it to herself. He was doing it for her; he was being nice to the Hawkinsite for her sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake was saying with his grin, \"You don\u0027t look very large, Dr. Tholan. I should say that you are an inch taller than I am, which would make you six feet two inches tall. Is it that you are young, or is it that the others on your world are generally small?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither,\" said the Hawkinsite. \"We grow at a diminishing rate with the years, so that at my age it would take fifteen years to grow an additional inch, but-and this is the important point-we never entirely stop. And, of course, as a consequence, we never entirely die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake gasped and even Rose felt herself sitting stiffly upright. This was something new. This was something which, to her knowledge, the few expeditions to Hawkin\u0027s Planet had never brought back. She was torn with excitement but held an exclamation back and let Drake speak for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"They don\u0027t entirely die? You\u0027re not trying to say, sir, that the people on Hawkin\u0027s Planet are immortal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No people are truly immortal. If there were no other way to die, there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould always be accident, and if that fails, there is boredom. Few of us live more than several centuries of your time. Still, it is unpleasant to think that death may come involuntarily. It is something which, to us, is extremely horrible. It bothers me even as I think of it now, this thought that against my will and despite all care, death may come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We,\" said Drake, grimly, \"are quite used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You Earthmen live with the thought; we do not. And this is why we are disturbed to find that the incidence of Inhibition Death has been increasing in recent years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have not yet explained,\" said Drake, \"just what the Inhibition Death is, but let me guess. Is the Inhibition Death a pathological cessation of growth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how long after growth\u0027s cessation does death follow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within the year. It is a wasting disease, a tragic one, and absolutely incurable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What causes it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite paused a long time before answering, and even then there was something strained and uneasy about the way he spoke. \"Mr. Smollett, we know nothing about the cause of the disease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake nodded thoughtfully. Rose was following the conversation as though she were a spectator at a tennis match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"And why do you come to Earth to study this disease?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because again Earthmen are unique. They are the only intelligent beings who are immune. The Inhibition Death affects all the other races. Do your biologists know that, Mrs. Smollett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had addressed her suddenly, so that she jumped slightly. She said, \"No, they don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not surprised. That piece of information is the result of very recent research. The Inhibition Death is easily diagnosed incorrectly and the incidence is much lower on the other planets. In fact, it is a strange thing, something to philosophize over, that the incidence of the Death is highest on my world, which is closest to Earth, and lower on each more distant planet-so that it is lowest on the world of the star Tempora, which is farthest from Earth, while Earth itself is immune. Somewhere in the biochemistry of the Earthite, there is the secret of that immunity. How interesting it would be to find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"But look here, you can\u0027t say Earth is immune. From where I sit, it looks as if the incidence is a hundred per cent. All Earthmen stop growing and all Earthmen die. We\u0027ve all got the Inhibition Death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Earthmen live up to seventy years after the cessation of growth. That is not the Death as we know it. Your equivalent disease is rather one of unrestrained growth. Cancer, you call it. -But come, I bore you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose protested instantly. Drake did likewise with even more vehemence, but the Hawkinsite determinedly changed the subject. It was then that Rose had her first pang of suspicion, for Drake circled Harg Tholan warily with his words, worrying him, jabbing at him, attempting always to get the information back to the point where the Hawkinsite had left off. Not badly, not unskillfully, but Rose knew him, and could tell what he was after. And what could he be after but that which was demanded by his profession? And, as though in response to her thoughts, the Hawkinsite took up the phrase which had begun careening in her mind like a broken record on a perpetual turntable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"Did you not say you were a policeman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, curtly, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there is something I would like to request you to do for me. I have been wantisg to all this evening, since I discovered your profession, and yet I hesitate. I do not wish to be troublesome to my host and hostess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do what we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a profound curiosity as to how Earthmen live; a curiosity which is not perhaps shared by the generality of my countrymen. So I wonder, could you show me through one of the police departments on your planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not belong to a police department in exactly the way you imagine,\" said Drake, cautiously. \"However, I am known to the New York police department. I can manage it without trouble. Tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be most convenient for me. Would I be able to visit the Missing Persons Bureau?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite drew his four standing legs closer together, as if he were becoming more intense. \"It is a hobby of mine, a little queer comer of interest I have always had. I understand you have a group of police officers whose sole duty it is to search for men who are missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And women and children,\" added Drake. \"But why should that interest you so particularly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there again you are unique. There is no such thing as a missing person on our planet. I can\u0027t explain the mechanism to you, of course, but among the people of other worlds, there is always an awareness of one another\u0027s presence, especially if there is a strong, affectionate tie. We are always aware of each other\u0027s exact location, no matter where on the planet we might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose grew excited again. The scientific expeditions to Hawkin\u0027s Planet had always had the greatest difficulty in penetrating the internal emotional mechanisms of the natives, and here was one who talked freely, who would explain! She forgot to worry about Drake and intruded into the conversations. \"Can you feel such awareness even now? On Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, \"You mean across space? No, I\u0027m afraid not. But you see the importance of the matter. All the uniqueness of Earth should be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elinked. If the lack of this sense can be explained, perhaps the immunity to Inhibition Death can be, also. Besides, it strikes me as very curious that any form of intelligent community life can be built among people who lack this community awareness. How can an Earthman tell, for instance, when he has formed a congenial sub-group, a family? How can you two, for instance, know that there is a true tie between you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose found herself nodding. How strongly she missed such a sense!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Drake only smiled. \"We have our ways. It is as difficult to explain what we call \u0027love\u0027 to you as it is for you to explain your sense to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so. Yet tell me truthfully, Mr. Smollett-if Mrs. Smollett were to leave this room and enter another without your having seen her do so, would you really not be aware of her location?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really would not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, \"Amazing.\" He hesitated, then added, \"Please do not be offended at the fact that I find it revolting as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the light in the bedroom had been put out, Rose went to the door three times, opening it a crack and peering out. She could feel Drake watching her. There was a hard kind of amusement in his voice as he asked, finally, \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I want to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you afraid our friend can hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose was whispering. She got into bed and put her head on his pillow so that she could whisper better. She said, \"Why were you talking about the Inhibition Death to Dr. Tholan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am taking an interest in your work, Rose. You\u0027ve always wanted me to take an interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather you weren\u0027t sarcastic.\" She was almost violent, as nearly violent as she could be in a whisper. \"I know that there\u0027s something of your own interest in this-of police interest, probably. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027ll talk to you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hand under her head, lifting it. For a wild moment she thought he was going to kiss her-just kiss her on impulse the way husbands sometimes did, or as she imagined they sometimes did. Drake never did, and he didn\u0027t now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe merely held her close and whispered, \"Why are you so interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand was almost brutally hard upon the nape of her neck, so that she stiffened and tried to draw back. Her voice was more than a whisper now. \"Stop it, Drake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I want no questions from you and no interference. You do your job, and I\u0027ll do mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The nature of my job is open and known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The nature of my job,\" he retorted, \"isn\u0027t, by definition. But I\u0027ll tell you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis. Our six-legged friend is here in this house for some definite reason. You weren\u0027t picked as biologist in charge for any random reason. Do you know that two days ago, he\u0027d been inquiring about me at the Commission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re joking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t believe that for a minute. There are depths to this that you know nothing about. But that\u0027s my job and I won\u0027t discuss it with you any further. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I won\u0027t question you if you don\u0027t want me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay stiffly on her back and the minutes passed, and then the quarter-hours. She was trying to fit the pieces together. Even with what Drake had told her, the curves and colors refused to blend. She wondered what Drake would say if he knew she had a recording of that night\u0027s conversation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne picture remained clear in her mind at that moment. It hovered over her mockingly. The Hawkinsite, at the end of the long evening, had turned to her and said gravely, \"Good night, Mrs. Smollett. You are a most charming hostess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had desperately wanted to giggle at the time. How could he call her a charming hostess? To him, she could only be a horror, a monstrosity with too few limbs and a too-narrow face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as the Hawkinsite delivered himself of this completely meaningless piece of politeness, Drake had turned white! For one instant, his eyes had burned with something that looked like terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never before known Drake to show fear of anything, and the picture of that instant of pure panic remained with her until all her thoughts finally sagged into the oblivion of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was noon before Rose was at her desk the next day. She had deliberately waited until Drake and the Hawkinsite had left, since only then was she able to remove the small recorder that had been behind Drake\u0027s armchair the previous evening. She had had no original intention of keeping its presence secret from him. It was just that he had come home so late, and she couldn\u0027t say anything about it with the Hawkinsite present. Later on, of course, things had changed-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe placing of the recorder had been only a routine maneuver. The Hawkinsite\u0027s statements and intonations needed to be preserved for future intensive studies by various specialists at the Institute. It had been hidden in order to avoid the distortions of self-consciousness that the visibility of such a device would bring, and now it couldn\u0027t be shown to the members of the Institute at all. It would have to serve a different function altogether. A rather nasty function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to spy on Drake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched the little box with her fingers and wondered, irrelevantly, how Drake was going to manage, that day. Social intercourse between in-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehabited worlds was, even now, not so commonplace that the sight of a Hawkinsite on the city streets would not succeed in drawing crowds. But Drake would manage, she knew. Drake always managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened once again to the sounds of last evening, repeating the interesting moments. She was dissatisfied with what Drake had told her. Why should the Hawkinsite have been interested in the two of them particularly? Yet Drake wouldn\u0027t lie. She would have liked to check at the Security Commission, but she knew she could not do that. Besides, the thought made her feel disloyal; Drake would definitely not lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, then again, why should Harg Tholan not have investigated them? He might have inquired similarly about the families of all the biologists at the Institute. It would be no more than natural to attempt to choose the home he would find most pleasant by his own standards, whatever they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if he had-even if he had investigated only the Smolletts-why should that create the great change in Drake from intense hostility to intense interest? Drake undoubtedly had knowledge he was keeping to himself. Only heaven knew how much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts churned slowly through the possibilities of interstellar intrigue. So far, to be sure, there were no signs of hostility or ill-feeling among any of the five intelligent races known to inhabit the Galaxy. As yet they were spaced at intervals too wide for enmity. Even the barest contact among them was all but impossible. Economic and political interests just had no point at which to conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was only her idea and she was not a member of the Security Commission. If there were conflict, if there were danger, if there were any reason to suspect that the mission of a Hawkinsite might be other than peaceful-Drake would know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet was Drake sufficiently high in the councils of the Security Commission to know, off-hand, the dangers involved in the visit of a Hawkinsite physician? She had never thought of his position as more than that of a very minor functionary in the Commission; he had never presented himself as more. And yet-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMight he be more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged at the thought. It was reminiscent of Twentieth Century spy novels and of costume dramas of the days when there existed such things as atom bomb secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of costume dramas decided her. Unlike Drake, she wasn\u0027t a real policeman, and she didn\u0027t know how a real policeman would go about it. But she knew how such things were done in the old dramas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew a piece of paper toward her and, with a quick motion, slashed a vertical pencil mark down its center. She headed one column \"Harg Tholan,\" the other \"Drake.\" Under \"Harg Tholan\" she wrote \"bonafide\" and thoughtfully put three question marks after it. After all, was he a doctor at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall, or was he what could only be described as an interstellar agent? What proof had even the Institute of his profession except his own statements? Was that why Drake had quizzed him so relentlessly concerning the Inhibition Death? Had he boned up in advance and tried to catch the Hawkinsite in an error?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, she was irresolute; then, springing to her feet, she folded the paper, put it in the pocket of her short jacket, and swept out of her office. She said nothing to any of those she passed as she left the Institute. She left no word at the reception desk as to where she was going, or when she would be back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce outside, she hurried into the third-level tube and waited for an empty compartment to pass. The two minutes that elapsed seemed unbearably long. It was all she could do to say, \"New York Academy of Medicine,\" into the mouthpiece just above the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door of the little cubicle closed, and the sound of the air flowing past the compartment hissed upward in pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New York Academy of Medicine had been enlarged both vertically and horizontally in the past two decades. The library alone occupied one entire wing of the third floor. Undoubtedly, if all the books, pamphlets and periodicals it contained were in their original printed form, rather than in microfilm, the entire building, huge though it was, would not have been sufficiently vast to hold them. As it was, Rose knew there was already talk of limiting printed works to the last five years, rather than to the last ten, as was now the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose, as a member of the Academy, had free entry to the library. She hurried toward the alcoves devoted to extraterrestrial medicine and was relieved to find them unoccupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might have been wiser to have enlisted the aid of a librarian, but she chose not to. The thinner and smaller the trail she left, the less likely it was that Drake might pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, without guidance, she was satisfied to travel along the shelves, following the titles anxiously with her fingers. The books were almost all in English, though some were in German or Russian. None, ironically enough, were in extraterrestrial symbolisms. There was a room somewhere for such originals, but they were available only to official translators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer traveling eye and finger stopped. She had found what she was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged half a dozen volumes from the shelf and spread them out upon the small dark table. She fumbled for the light switch and opened the first of the volumes. It was entitled Studies on Inhibition She leafed through it and then turned to the author index. The name of Harg Tholan was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ew One by one, she looked up the references indicated, then returned to the shelves for translations of such original papers as she could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent more than two hours in the Academy. When she was finished, she knew this much-there was a Hawkinsite doctor named Harg Tholan, who was an expert on the Inhibition Death. He was connected with the Hawkinsite research organization with which the Institute had been in correspondence. Of course, the Harg Tholan she knew might simply be impersonating an actual doctor to make the role more realistic, but why should that be necessary?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the paper out of her pocket and, where she had written \"bo-nafide\" with three question marks, she now wrote a YES in capitals. She went back to the Institute and at 4 p.m. was once again at her desk. She called the switchboard to say that she would not answer any phone calls and then she locked her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath the column headed \"Harg Tholan\" she now wrote two questions: \"Why did Harg Tholan come to Earth alone?\" She left considerable space. Then, \"What is his interest in the Missing Persons Bureau?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainly, the Inhibition Death was all the Hawkinsite said it was. From her reading at the Academy, it was obvious that it occupied the major share of medical effort on Hawkin\u0027s Planet. It was more feared there than cancer was on Earth. If they had thought the answer to it lay on Earth, the Hawkinsites would have sent a full-scale expedition. Was it distrust and suspicion on their part that made them send only one investigator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it Harg Tholan had said the night before? The incidence of the Death was highest upon his own world, which was closest to Earth, lowest upon the world farthest from Earth. Add to that the fact implied by the Hawkinsite, and verified by her own readings at the Academy, that the incidence had expanded enormously since interstellar contact had been made with Earth. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly and reluctantly she came to one conclusion. The inhabitants of Hawkin\u0027s Planet might have decided that somehow Earth had discovered the cause of the Inhibition Death, and was deliberately fostering it among the alien peoples of the Galaxy, with the intention, perhaps, of becoming supreme among the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rejected this conclusion with what was almost panic. It could not be; it was impossible. In the first place, Earth wouldn \u0027t do such a horrible thing. Secondly, it couldn \u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as scientific advance was concerned, the beings of Hawkin\u0027s Planet were certainly the equals of Earthmen. The Death had occurred there for thousands of years and their medical record was one of total failure. Surely, Earth, in its long-distance investigations into alien biochemistry, could not have succeeded so quickly. In fact, as far as she knew, there were no investi-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egations to speak of into Hawkinsite pathology on the part of Earth biologists and physicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet all the evidence indicated that Harg Tholan had come in suspicion and had been received in suspicion. Carefully, she wrote down under the question, \"Why did Harg Tholan come to Earth alone?\" the answer, \"Haw-kin\u0027s Planet believes Earth is causing the Inhibition Death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, then, what was this business about the Bureau of Missing Persons? As a scientist, she was rigorous about the theories she developed. All the facts had to fit in, not merely some of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMissing Persons Bureau! If it was a false trail, deliberately intended to deceive Drake, it had been done clumsily, since it came only after an hour of discussion of the Inhibition Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it intended as an opportunity to study Drake? If so, why? Was this perhaps the major point? The Hawkinsite had investigated Drake before coming to them. Had he come because Drake was a policeman with entry to Bureaus of Missing Persons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave it up and turned to the column headed \"Drake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there a question wrote itself, not in pen and ink upon the paper, but in the much more visible letters of thought on mind. Why did he marry me? thought Rose, and she covered her eyes with her hands so that the unfriendly light was excluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had met quite by accident somewhat more than a year before, when he had moved into the apartment house in which she then lived. Polite greetings had somehow become friendly conversation and this, in turn, had led to occasional dinners in a neighborhood restaurant. It had been very friendly and normal and an exciting new experience, and she had fallen in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he asked her to marry him, she was pleased-and overwhelmed. At the time, she had many explanations for it. He appreciated her intelligence and friendliness. She was a nice girl. She would make a good wife, a splendid companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had tried all those explanations and had half-believed every one of them. But half-belief was not enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not that she had any definite fault to find in Drake as a husband. He was always thoughtful, kind and a gentleman. Their married life was not one of passion, and yet it suited the paler emotional surges of the late thirties. She wasn\u0027t nineteen. What did she expect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it; she wasn\u0027t nineteen. She wasn\u0027t beautiful, or charming, or glamorous. What did she expect? Could she have expected Drake-handsome and rugged, whose interest in intellectual pursuits was quite minor, who neither asked about her work in all the months of their marriage, nor offered to discuss his own with her? Why, then, did he marry her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 But there was no answer to that question, and it had nothing to do with what Rose was trying to do now. It was extraneous, she told herself fiercely; it was a childish distraction from the task she had set herself. She was acting like a girl of nineteen, after all, with no chronological excuse for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found that the point of her pencil had somehow broken, and took a new one. In the column headed \"Drake\" she wrote, \"Why is he suspicious of Harg Tholan?\" and under it she put an arrow pointing to the other column.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she had already written there was sufficient explanation. If Earth was spreading the Inhibition Death, or if Earth knew it was suspected of such a deed, then, obviously, it would be preparing for eventual retaliation on the part of the aliens. In fact, the setting would actually be one of preliminary maneuvering for the first interstellar war of history. It was an adequate but horrible explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there was left the second question, the one she could not answer. She wrote it slowly, \"Why Drake\u0027s reaction to Tholan\u0027s words, \u0027You are a most charming hostess\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to bring back the exact setting. The Hawkinsite had said it innocuously, matter-of-factly, politely, and Drake had frozen at the sound of it. Over and over, she had listened to that particular passage in the recording. An Earthman might have said it in just such an inconsequential tone on leaving a routine cocktail party. The recording did not carry the sight of Drake\u0027s face; she had only her memory for that. Drake\u0027s eyes had become alive with fear and hate, and Drake was one who feared practically nothing. What was there to fear in the phrase, \"You are a most charming hostess,\" that could upset him so? Jealousy? Absurd. The feeling that Tholan had been sarcastic? Maybe, though unlikely. She was sure Tholan was sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave it up and put a large question mark under that second question. There were two of them now, one under \"Harg Tholan\" and one under \"Drake.\" Could there be a connection between Tholan\u0027s interest in missing persons and Drake\u0027s reaction to a polite party phrase? She could think of none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her head down upon her arms. It was getting dark in the office and she was very tired. For a while, she must have hovered in that queer land between waking and sleeping, when thoughts and phrases lose the control of the conscious and disport themselves erratically and surrealisti-cally through one\u0027s head. But, no matter where they danced and leaped, they always returned to that one phrase, \"You are a most charming hostess.\" Sometimes she heard it in Harg Tholan\u0027s cultured, lifeless voice, and sometimes in Drake\u0027s vibrant one. When Drake said it, it was full of love, full of a love she never heard from him. She liked to hear him say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe startled herself to wakefulness. It was quite dark in the office now, and she put on the desk light. She blinked, then frowned a little. Another\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought must have come to her in that fitful half-sleep. There had been another phrase which had upset Drake. What was it? Her forehead furrowed with mental effort. It had not been last evening. It was not anything in the recorded conversation, so it must have been before that. Nothing came and she grew restless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at her watch, she gasped. It was almost eight. They would be at home waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she did not want to go home. She did not want to face them. Slowly, she took up the paper upon which she had scrawled her thoughts of the afternoon, tore it into little pieces and let them flutter into the little atomic-flash ashtray upon her desk. They were gone in a little flare and nothing was left of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only nothing were left of the thoughts they represented as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no use. She would have to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were not there waiting for her, after all. She came upon them getting out of a gyrocab just as she emerged from the tubes on to street level. The gyrocabbie, wide-eyed, gazed after his fares for a moment, then hovered upward and away. By unspoken mutual consent, the three waited until they had entered the apartment before speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said disinterestedly, \"I hope you have had a pleasant day, Dr. Tho-lan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite. And a fascinating and profitable one as well, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you had a chance to eat?\" Though Rose had not herself eaten, she was anything but hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake interrupted, \"We had lunch and supper sent up to us. Sandwiches.\" He sounded tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, \"Hello, Drake.\" It was the first time she had addressed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake scarcely looked at her. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, \"Your tomatoes are remarkable vegetables. We have nothing to compare with them in taste on our own planet. I believe I ate two dozen, as well as an entire bottle of tomato derivative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ketchup,\" explained Drake, briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, \"And your visit at the Missing Persons Bureau, Dr. Tholan? You say you found it profitable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should say so. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose kept her back to him. She plumped up sofa cushions as she said, \"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find it most interesting that the large majority of missing persons are males. Wives frequently report missing husbands, while the reverse is practically never the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, \"Oh, that\u0027s not mysterious, Dr. Tholan. You simply don\u0027t realize the economic setup we have on Earth. On this planet, you see, it is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe male who is usually the member of the family that maintains it as an economic unit. He is the one whose labor is repaid in units of currency. The wife\u0027s function is generally that of taking care of home and children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely this is not universal!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake put in, \"More or less. If you are thinking of my wife, she is an example of the minority of women who are capable of making their own way in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose looked at him swiftly. Was he being sarcastic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, \"Your implication, Mrs. Smollett, is that women, being economically dependent upon their male companions, find it less feasible to disappear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a gentle way of putting it,\" said Rose, \"but that\u0027s about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And would you call the Missing Persons Bureau of New York a fair sampling of such cases in the planet at large?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, I should think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, abruptly, \"And is there, then, an economic explanation for the fact that since interstellar travel has been developed, the percentage of young males among the missing is more pronounced than ever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Drake who answered, with a verbal snap. \"Good lord, that\u0027s even less of a mystery than the other. Nowadays, the runaway has all space to disappear into. Anyone who wants to get away from trouble need only hop the nearest space freighter. They\u0027re always looking for crewmen, no questions asked, and it would be almost impossible to locate the runaway after that, if he really wanted to stay out of circulation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And almost always young men in their first year of marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose laughed suddenly. She said, \"Why, that\u0027s just the time a man\u0027s troubles seem the greatest. If he survives the first year, there is usually no need to disappear at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake was obviously not amused. Rose thought again that he looked tired and unhappy. Why did he insist on bearing the load alone? And then she thought that perhaps he had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, suddenly, \"Would it offend you if I disconnected for a period of time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, \"Not at all. I hope you haven\u0027t had too exhausting a day. Since you come from a planet whose gravity is greater than that of Earth\u0027s, I\u0027m afraid we too easily presume that you would show greater endurance than we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I am not tired in a physical sense.\" He looked for a moment at her legs and blinked very rapidly, indicating amusement. \"You know, I keep expecting Earthmen to fall either forward or backward in view of their meager equipment of standing limbs. You must pardon me if my comment is overfamiliar, but your mention of the lesser gravity of Earth brought it to my mind. On my planet, two legs would simply not be enough. But this is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall beside the point at the moment. It is just that I have been absorbing so many new and unusual concepts that I feel the desire for a little disconnection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose shrugged inwardly. Well, that was as close as one race could get to another, anyway. As nearly as the expeditions to Hawkin\u0027s Planet could make out, Hawkinsites had the faculty for disconnecting their conscious mind from all its bodily functions and allowing it to sink into an undisturbed meditative process for periods of time lasting up to terrestrial days. Hawkinsites found the process pleasant, even necessary sometimes, though no Earthman could truly say what function it served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversely, it had never been entirely possible for Earthmen to explain the concept of \"sleep\" to a Hawkinsite, or to any extraterrestrial. What an Earthman would call sleep or a dream, a Hawkinsite would view as an alarming sign of mental disintegration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose thought uneasily, Here is another way Earthmen are unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite was backing away, drooping so that his forelimbs swept the floor in polite farewell. Drake nodded curtly at him as he disappeared behind the bend in the corridor. They heard his door open, close, then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter minutes in which the silence was thick between them, Drake\u0027s chair creaked as he shifted restlessly. With a mild horror, Rose noticed blood upon his lips. She thought to herself, He\u0027s in some kind of trouble. I\u0027ve got to talk to him. I can\u0027t let it go on like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Drake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake seemed to look at her from a far, far distance. Slowly, his eyes focused closer at hand and he said, \"What is it? Are you through for the day, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m ready to begin. It\u0027s the tomorrow you spoke of. Aren\u0027t you going to speak to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night, you said you would speak to me tomorrow. I am ready now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake frowned. His eyes withdrew beneath a lowered brow and Rose felt some of her resolution begin to leave her. He said, \"I thought it was agreed that you would not question me about my business in this matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s too late for that. I know too much about your business by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" he shouted, jumping to his feet. Recollecting himself, he approached, laid his hands upon her shoulders and repeated in a lower voice, \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose kept her eyes upon her hands, which rested limply in her lap. She bore the painfully gripping fingers patiently, and said slowly, \"Dr. Tholan thinks that Earth is spreading the Inhibition Death purposely. That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited. Slowly, the grip relaxed and he was standing there, hands at his side, face baffled and unhappy. He said, \"Where did you get that notion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said breathlessly, unnaturally, \"I want to know exactly why you say that. Don\u0027t play foolish games with me, Rose. This is for keeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I tell you, will you answer one question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Earth spreading the disease deliberately, Drake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake flung his hands upward. \"Oh, for Heaven\u0027s sake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt before her. He took her hands in his and she could feel their trembling. He was forcing his voice into soothing, loving syllables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was saying, \"Rose dear, look, you\u0027ve got something red-hot by the tail and you think you can use it to tease me in a little husband-wife repartee. No, I\u0027m not asking much. Just tell me exactly what causes you to say what- what you have just said.\" He was terribly earnest about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was at the New York Academy of Medicine this afternoon. I did some reading there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why? What made you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seemed so interested in the Inhibition Death, for one thing. And Dr. Tholan made those statements about the incidence increasing since interstellar travel, and being the highest on the planet nearest Earth.\" She paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your reading?\" he prompted. \"What about your reading, Rose?\" c\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"It backs him up. All I could do was to skim hastily into the direction of their research in recent decades. It seems obvious to me, though, that at least some of the Hawkinsites are considering the possibility the Inhibition Death originates on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they say so outright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Or, if they have, I haven\u0027t seen it.\" She gazed at him in surprise. In a matter like this, certainly the government would have investigated Hawkinsite research on the matter. She said, gently, \"Don\u0027t you know about Hawkinsite research in the matter, Drake? The government-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind about that.\" Drake had moved away from her and now he turned again. His eyes were bright. He said, as though making a wonderful discovery, \"Why, you\u0027re an expert in this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she? Did he find that out only now that he needed her? Her nostrils flared and she said flatly, \"I am a biologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Yes, I know that, but I mean your particular specialty is growth. Didn\u0027t you once tell me you had done work on growth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might call it that. I\u0027ve had twenty papers published on the relationship of nucleic acid fine structure and embryonic development on my Cancer Society grant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I should have thought of that.\" He was choked with a new excitement. \"Tell me, Rose- Look, I\u0027m sorry if I lost my temper with you a moment ago. You\u0027d be as competent as anyone to understand the direction of their researches if you read about it, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fairly competent, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell me how they think the disease is spread. The details, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, now look, that\u0027s asking a little too much. 1 spent a few hours in the Academy, that\u0027s all. I\u0027d need much more time than that to be able to answer your question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An intelligent guess, at least. You can\u0027t imagine how important it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, doubtfully, \"Of course, \u0027Studies on Inhibition\u0027 is a major treatise in the field. It would summarize all of the available research data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? And how recent is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of those periodic things. The last volume is about a year old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it have any account of his work in it?\" His finger jabbed in the direction of Harg Tholan\u0027s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than anyone else\u0027s. He\u0027s an outstanding worker in the field. I looked over his papers especially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are his theories about the origin of the disease? Try to remember, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head at him. \"I could swear he blames Earth, but he admits they know nothing about how the disease is spread. I could swear to that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood stiffly before her. His strong hands were clenched into fists at his side and his words were scarcely more than a mutter. \"It could be a matter of complete overestimation. Who knows-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled away. \"I\u0027ll find out about this right now, Rose. Thank you for your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran after him. \"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask him a few questions.\" He was rummaging through the drawers of his desk and now his right hand withdrew. It held a needle-gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried, \"No, Drake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook her off roughly, and turned down the corridor toward the Hawkinsite\u0027s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake threw the door open and entered. Rose was at his heels, still trying to grasp his arm, but now he stopped and looked at Harg Tholan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite was standing there motionless, eyes unfocused, his four standing limbs sprawled out in four directions as far as they would go. Rose felt ashamed of intruding, as though she were violating an intimate rite. But Drake, apparently unconcerned, walked to within four feet of the creature and stood there. They were face to face, Drake holding the needle-gun easily at a level of about the center of the Hawkinsite\u0027s torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"Now keep quiet. He\u0027ll gradually become aware of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 \"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The answer was flat. \"I know. Now get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she did not move and Drake was too absorbed to pay her further attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortions of the skin on the Hawkinsite\u0027s face were beginning to quiver slightly. It was rather repulsive and Rose found herself preferring not to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake suddenly, \"That\u0027s about all, Dr. Tholan. Don\u0027t throw in connection with any of the limbs. Your sense organs and voice box will be quite enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite\u0027s voice was dim. \"Why do you invade my disconnection chamber?\" Then, more strongly, \"And why are you armed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head wobbled slightly atop a still frozen torso. He had, apparently, followed Drake\u0027s suggestion against limb connection. Rose wondered how Drake knew such partial reconnection to be possible. She herself had not known of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite spoke again. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this time Drake answered. He said, \"The answer to certain questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a gun in your hand? I would not humor your discourtesy so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would not merely be humoring me. You might be saving your own life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be a matter of considerable indifference to me, under the circumstances. I am sorry, Mr. Smollett, that the duties toward a guest are so badly understood on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are no guest of mine, Dr. Tholan,\" said Drake. \"You entered my house on false pretenses. You had some reason for it, some way you had planned of using me to further your own purposes. I have no compunction in reversing the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had better shoot. It will save time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are convinced that you will answer no questions? That, in itself, is suspicious. It seems that you consider certain answers to be more important than your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I consider the principles of courtesy to be very important. You, as an Earthman, may not understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not. But I, as an Earthman, understand one thing.\" Drake had jumped forward, faster than Rose could cry out, faster than the Hawkinsite could connect his limbs. When he sprang backward, the flexible hose of Harg Tholan\u0027s cyanide cylinder was in his hand. At the corner of the Hawkinsite\u0027s wide mouth, where the hose had once been affixed, a droplet of colorless liquid oozed sluggishly from a break in the rough skin, and slowly solidified into a brown jellylike globule, as it oxidized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake yanked at the hose and the cylinder jerked free. He plunged home the knob that controlled the needle valve at the head of the cylinder and the small hissing ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt,\" said Drake, \"that enough will have escaped to endanger us. I hope, however, that you realize what will happen to you now, if you do not answer the questions I am going to ask you-and answer them in such a way that I am convinced you are being truthful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me back my cylinder,\" said the Hawkinsite, slowly, \"If not, it will be necessary for me to attack you and then it will be necessary for you to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake stepped back. \"Not at all. Attack me and I shoot your legs from under you. You will lose them; all four, if necessary, but you will still live, in a horrible way. You will live to die of cyanide lack. It would be a most uncomfortable death. I am only an Earthman and I can\u0027t appreciate its true horrors, but you can, can\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite\u0027s mouth was open and something within quivered yellow-green. Rose wanted to throw up. She wanted to scream. Give him bock the cylinder, Drake! But nothing would come. She couldn\u0027t even turn her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"You have about an hour, I think, before the effects are irreversible. Talk quickly, Dr. Tholan, and you will have your cylinder back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after that-\" said the Hawkinsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After that, what does it matter to you? Even if I kill you then, it will be a clean death; not cyanide lack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething seemed to pass out of the Hawkinsite. His voice grew guttural and his words blurred as though he no longer had the energy to keep his English perfect. He said, \"What are your questions?\" and as he spoke, his eyes followed the cylinder in Drake\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake swung it deliberately, tantalizingly, and the creature\u0027s eyes followed -followed-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"What are your theories concerning the Inhibition Death? Why did you really come to Earth? What is your interest in the Missing Persons Bureau?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose found herself waiting in breathless anxiety. These were the questions she would like to have asked, too. Not in this manner, perhaps, but in Drake\u0027s job, kindness and humanity had to take second place to necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe repeated that to herself several times in an effort to counteract the fact that she found herself loathing Drake for what he was doing to Dr. Tholan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, \"The proper answer would take more than the hour I have left me. You have bitterly shamed me by forcing me to talk under duress. On my own planet, you could not have done so under any circumstances. It is only here, on this revolting planet, that I can be deprived of cyanide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are wasting your hour, Dr. Tholan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have told you this eventually, Mr. Smollett. I needed your help. It is why I came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are still not answering my questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will answer them now. For years, in addition to my regular scientific work, I have been privately investigating the cells of my patients suffering from Inhibition Death. I have been forced to use the utmost secrecy and to work without assistance, since the methods I used to investigate the bodies of my patients were frowned upon by my people. Your society would have similar feelings against human vivisection, for instance. For this reason, I could not present the results I obtained to my fellow physicians until I had verified my theories here on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were your theories?\" demanded Drake. The feverishness had returned to his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It became more and more obvious to me as I proceeded with my studies that the entire direction of research into the Inhibition Death was wrong. Physically, there was no solution to its mystery. The Inhibition Death is entirely a disease of the mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose interrupted, \"Surely, Dr. Tholan, it isn\u0027t psychosomatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin, gray translucent film had passed over the Hawkinsite\u0027s eyes. He no longer looked at them. He said, \"No, Mrs. Smollett, it is not psychosomatic. It is a true disease of the mind; a mental infection. My patients had double minds. Beyond and beneath the one that obviously belonged to them, there was evidence of another one-an alien mind. I worked with Inhibition Death patients of other races than my own, and the same could be found. In short, there are not five intelligences in the Galaxy, but six. And the sixth is parasitic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, \"This is wild-impossible! You must be mistaken, Dr. Tholan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not mistaken. Until I came to Earth, I thought I might be. But my stay at the Institute and my researches at the Missing Persons Bureau convinced me that is not so. What is so impossible about the concept of a parasitic intelligence? Intelligences like these would not leave fossil remains, nor even leave artifacts-if their only function is to derive nourishment somehow from the mental activities of other creatures. One can imagine such a parasite, through the course of millions of years, perhaps, losing all portions of its physical being but that which remains necessary, just as a tapeworm, among your Earthly physical parasites, eventually lost all its functions but the single one of reproduction. In the case of the parasitic intelligence, all physical attributes would eventually be lost. It would become nothing but pure mind, living in some mental fashion we cannot conceive of on the minds of others. Particularly on the minds of Earthmen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said, \"Why particularly Earthmen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake simply stood apart, intent, asking no further questions. He was content, apparently, to let the Hawkinsite speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you not surmised that the sixth intelligence is a native of Earth? Mankind from the beginning has lived with it, has adapted to it, is unconscious of it. It is why the higher species of terrestrial animals, including man, do not grow after maturity and, eventually, die what is called natural death. It is the result of this universal parasitic infestation. It is why you sleep and dream, since it is then that the parasitic mind must feed and then that you are a little more conscious of it, perhaps. It is why the terrestrial mind alone of the intelligences is so subject to instability. Where else in the Galaxy are found split personalities and other such manifestations? After all, even now there must be occasional human minds which are visibly harmed by the presence of the parasite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow, these parasitic minds could traverse space. They had no physical limitations. They could drift between the stars in what would correspond to a state of hibernation. Why the first ones did it, I don\u0027t know; probably no one will ever know. But once those first discovered the presence of intelligence on other planets in the Galaxy, there was a small, steady stream of parasitic intelligences making their way through space. We of the outer worlds must have been a gourmet\u0027s dish for them or they would have never struggled so hard to get to us. I imagine many must have failed to make the trip, but it must have been worth the effort to those who succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you see, we of the other worlds had not lived with these parasites for millions of years, as man and his ancestors had. We had not adapted ourselves to it. Our weak strains had not been killed off gradually through hundreds of generations until only the resistants were left. So, where Earthmen could survive the infection for decades with little harm, we others die a quick death within a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And is that why the incidence has increased since interstellar travel between Earth and the other planets has begun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" For a moment there was silence, and then the Hawkinsite said with a sudden access of energy, \"Give me back my cylinder. You have your answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, coolly, \"What about the Missing Persons Bureau?\" He was swinging the cylinder again; but now the Hawkinsite did not follow its movements. The gray translucent film on his eyes had deepened and Rose wondered whether that was simply an expression of weariness or an example of the changes induced by cyanide lack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite said, \"As we are not well adapted to the intelligence that infests man, neither is it well adapted to us. It can live on us-it even prefers to, apparently-but it cannot reproduce with ourselves alone as the source of its life. The Inhibition Death is therefore not directly contagious among our people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose looked at him with growing horror. \"What are you implying, Dr. Tholan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Earthman remains the prime host for the parasite. An Earthman may infect one of us if he remains among us. But the parasite, once it is located in an intelligence of the outer worlds, must somehow return to an Earthman, if it expects to reproduce. Before interstellar travel, this was possible only by a re-passage of space and therefore the incidence of infection remained infinitesimal. Now we are infected and reinfected as the parasites return to Earth and come back to us via the mind of Earthmen who travel through space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose said faintly, \"And the missing persons-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are the intermediate hosts. The exact process by which it is done, I, of course, do not know. The masculine terrestrial mind seems better suited for their purposes. You\u0027ll remember that at the Institute I was told that the life expectancy of the average human male is three years less than that of the average female. Once reproduction has been taken care of, the infested male leaves, by spaceship, for the outer worlds. He disappears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is impossible,\" insisted Rose. \"What you say implies that the parasite mind can control the actions of its host! This cannot be, or we of Earth would have noticed their presence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The control, Mrs. Smollett, may be very subtle, and may, moreover, be exerted only during the period of active reproduction. I simply point to your Missing Persons Bureau. Why do the young men disappear? You have economic and psychological explanations, but they are not sufficient. -But I am quite ill now and cannot speak much longer. I have only this to say. In the mental parasite, your people and mine have a common enemy. Earthmen, too, need not die involuntarily, except for its presence. I thought that if I found myself unable to return to my own world with my information because of the unorthodox methods I used to obtain it, I might bring it to the authorities on Earth, and ask their help in stamping out this menace. Imagine my pleasure when I found that the husband of one of the biologists at the Institute was a member of one of Earth\u0027s most important investigating bodies. Naturally, I did what I could to be made a guest at his home in order that I might deal with him privately; convince him of the terrible truth; utilize his position to help in the attack on the parasites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is, of course, now impossible. I cannot blame you too far. As Earthmen, you cannot be expected to understand the psychology of my people. Nevertheless, you must understand this. I can have no further dealing with either of you. I could not even bear to remain any longer on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"Then you alone, of all your people, have any knowledge of this theory of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I atone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake held out the cylinder. \"Your cyanide, Dr. Tholan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hawkinsite groped for it eagerly. His supple fingers manipulated the hose and the needle valve with the utmost delicacy. In the space of ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseconds, he had it in place and was inhaling the gas in huge breaths. His eyes were growing clear and transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake waited until the Hawkinsite breathings had subsided to normal, and then, without expression, he raised his needle-gun and fired. Rose screamed. The Hawkinsite remained standing. His four lower limbs were incapable of buckling, but his head lolled and from his suddenly flaccid mouth, the cyanide hose fell, disregarded. Once again, Drake closed the needle valve and now he tossed the cylinder aside and stood there somberly, looking at the dead creature. There was no external mark to show that he had been killed. The needle-gun\u0027s pellet, thinner than the needle which gave the gun its name, entered the body noiselessly and easily, and exploded with devastating effect only within the abdominal cavity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose ran from the room, still screaming. Drake pursued her, seized her arm. She heard the hard, flat sounds of his palm against her face without feeling them and subsided into little bubbling sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"I told you to have nothing to do with this. Now what do you think you\u0027ll do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Let me go. I want to leave. I want to go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of something it was my job to do? You heard what the creature was saying. Do you suppose I could allow him to return to his world and spread those lies? They would believe him. And what do you think would happen then? Can you imagine what an interstellar war might be like? They would imagine they would have to kill us all to stop the disease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an effort that seemed to turn her inside out, Rose steadied. She looked firmly into Drake\u0027s eyes and said, \"What Dr. Tholan said were no lies and no mistakes, Drake,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come now, you\u0027re hysterical. You need sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what he said is so because the Security Commission knows all about that same theory, and knows it to be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say such a preposterous thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you yourself let that slip twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"Sit down.\" She did so, and he stood there, looking curiously at her. \"So I have given myself away twice, have I? You\u0027ve had a busy day of detection, my dear. You have facets you keep well hidden.\" He sat down and crossed his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose thought, yes, she had had a busy day. She could see the electric clock on the kitchen wall from where she sat; it was more than two hours past midnight. Harg Tholan had entered their house thirty-five hours before and now he lay murdered in the spare bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"Well, aren\u0027t you going to tell me where I pulled my two boners?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You turned white when Harg Tholan referred to me as a charming hostess. Hostess has a double meaning, you know, Drake. A host is one who harbors a parasite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Number one,\" said Drake. \"What\u0027s number two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s something you did before Harg Tholan entered the house. I\u0027ve been trying to remember it for hours. Do you remember, Drake? You spoke about how unpleasant it was for Hawkinsites to associate with Earthmen, and I said Harg Tholan was a doctor and had to. I asked you if you thought that human doctors particularly enjoyed going to the tropics, or letting infected mosquitoes bite them. Do you remember how upset you became?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake laughed. \"I had no idea I was so transparent. Mosquitoes are hosts for the malaria and yellow fever parasites.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027ve done my best to keep you out of this. I tried to keep the Hawkinsite away. I tried threatening you. Now there\u0027s nothing left but to tell you the truth. I must, because only the truth-or death-will keep you quiet. And I don\u0027t want to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrank back in her chair, eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"The Commission knows the truth. It does us no good. We can only do all in our power to prevent the other worlds from finding out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the truth can\u0027t be held down forever! Harg Tholan found out. You\u0027ve killed him, but another extraterrestrial will repeat the same discovery -over and over again. You can\u0027t kill them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that, too,\" agreed Drake. \"We have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" cried Rose. \"Harg Tholan gave you the solution. He made no suggestions or threats of war between worlds. He suggested that we combine with the other intelligences and help to wipe out the parasite. And we can! If we, in common with all the others, put every scrap of effort into it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean we can trust him? Does he speak for his government or for the other races?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we dare to refuse the risk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake said, \"You don\u0027t understand.\" He reached toward her and took one of her cold, unresisting hands between both of his. He went on, \"I may seem silly trying to teach you anything about your specialty, but I want you to hear me out. Harg Tholan was right. Man and his prehistoric ancestors have been living with this parasitic intelligence for uncounted ages; certainly for a much longer period than we have been truly Homo sapiens. In that interval, we have not only become adapted to it, we have become dependent upon it. It is no longer a case of parasitism. It is a case of mutual cooperation. You biologists have a name for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tore her hand away. \"What are you talking about? Symbiosis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. We have a disease of our own, remember. It is a reverse disease; one of unrestrained growth. We\u0027ve mentioned it already as a contrast to the Inhibition Death. Well, what is the cause of cancer? How long have biologists, physiologists, biochemists and all the others been working on it? How much success have they had with it? Why? Can\u0027t you answer that for yourself now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, slowly, \"No, I can\u0027t. What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all very well to say that if we could remove the parasite, we would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave eternal growth and life if we wanted it; or at least until we got tired of being too big or of living too long, and did away with ourselves neatly. But how many millions of years has it been since the human body has had occasion to grow in such an unrestrained fashion? Can it do so any longer? Is the chemistry of the body adjusted to that? Has it got the proper whatch-amacallits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enzymes,\" Rose supplied in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, enzymes. It\u0027s impossible for us. If for any reason the parasitic intelligence, as Harg Tholan calls it, does leave the human body, or if its relationship to the human mind is in any way impaired, growth does take place, but not in any orderly fashion. We call the growth cancer. And there you have it. There\u0027s no way of getting rid of the parasite. We\u0027re together for all eternity. To get rid of their inhibition Death, extraterrestrials must first wipe out all vertebrate life on Earth. There is no other solution for them, and so we must keep knowledge of it from them. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth was dry and it was difficult to talk. \"I understand, Drake.\" She noticed that his forehead was damp and that there was a line of perspiration down each cheek. \"And now you\u0027ll have to get it out of the apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s late at night and I\u0027ll be able to get the body out of the building. From there on-\" He turned to her. \"I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand, Drake,\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarg Tholan was heavy. Drake had to drag him through the apartment. Rose turned away, retching. She hid her eyes until she heard the front door close. She whispered to herself, \"I understand, Drake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was 3 a.m. Nearly an hour had passed since she had heard the front door click gently into place behind Drake and his burden. She didn\u0027t know where he was going, what he intended doing-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there numbly. There was no desire to sleep; no desire to move. She kept her mind traveling in tight circles, away from the thing she knew and which she wanted not to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParasitic minds! Was it only a coincidence or was it some queer racial memory, some tenuous long-sustained wisp of tradition or insight, stretching back through incredible millennia, that kept current the odd myth of human beginnings? She thought to herself, there were two intelligences on Earth to begin with. There were humans in the Garden of Eden and also the serpent, which \"was more subtil than any beast of the field.\" The serpent infected man and, as a result, it lost its limbs. Its physical attributes were no longer necessary. And because of the infection, man was driven out of the Garden of eternal life. Death entered the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, despite her efforts, the circle of her thoughts expanded and returned to Drake. She shoved and it returned; she counted to herself, she recited the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enames of the objects in her field of vision, she cried, \"No, no, no,\" and it returned. It kept returning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake had lied to her. It had been a plausible story. It would have held good under most circumstances; but Drake was not a biologist. Cancer could not be, as Drake had said, a disease that was an expression of a lost ability for normal growth. Cancer attacked children while they were still growing; it could even attack embryonic tissue. It attacked fish, which, like extraterrestrials, never stopped growing while they lived, and died only by disease or accident. It attacked plants which had no minds and could not be parasitized. Cancer had nothing to do with the presence or absence of normal growth; it was the general disease of life, to which no tissue of no multicellular organism was completely immune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should not have bothered lying. He should not have allowed some obscure sentimental weakness to persuade him to avoid the necessity of killing her in that manner. She would tell them at the Institute. The parasite could be beaten. Its absence would not cause cancer. But who would believe her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands over her eyes. The young men who disappeared were usually in the first year of their marriage. Whatever the process of reproduction of the parasite intelligences, it must involve close association with another parasite-the type of close and continuous association that might only be possible if their respective hosts were in equally close relationship. As in the case of newly married couples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel her thoughts slowly disconnect. They would be coming to her. They would be saying, \"Where is Harg Tholan?\" And she would answer, \"With my husband.\" Only they would say, \"Where is your husband?\" because he would be gone, too. He needed her no longer. He would never return. They would never find him, because he would be out in space. She would report them both, Drake Smollett and Harg Tholan, to the Missing Persons Bureau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to weep, but couldn\u0027t; she was dry-eyed and it was painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she began to giggle and couldn\u0027t stop. It was very funny. She had looked for the answers to so many questions and had found them all. She had even found the answer to the question she thought had no bearing on the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had finally learned why Drake had married her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-30.html","bookId":1734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM"}
