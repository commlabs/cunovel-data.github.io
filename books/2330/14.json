This case here, Eldoniah flat-out did five out of six of those cabbies, no question, no argument. Cloonan he probably didn\u0027t do, and if somebody else ever comes along and looks better for it, well, nobody uptown\u0027s gonna argue against reopening the file.\" He picked up a pencil, tapped the eraser three times on the desktop, set it down. \"So if you got anything,\" he said casually, \"I\u0027d be happy to pass it on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I have anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you don\u0027t own a car, so I figure you probably take a lot of cabs. Maybe one of the drivers said something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like, \u0027Hey, mister, you look like you used to be a cop, an\u0027 ain\u0027t it a hell of a thing what happened to Tommy Cloonan?\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody ever said anything like that to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact, I don\u0027t take very many cabs at all. If it\u0027s too far to walk I\u0027ll take the subway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the bus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I\u0027ll take a bus,\" I said. \"Sometimes I\u0027ll stay home. Where are we going with this conversation, do you happen to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alan Watson should have taken a cab. He worked down at the World Trade Center and generally took the E train home to Forest Hills, but when he worked late he\u0027d take an express bus because he didn\u0027t like the longer walk late at night, or standing around on subway platforms. So he rode on the bus in air-conditioned comfort, had a slice of pizza on Austin Street, and was a block away from his house on Beechknoll Place when somebody stuck a knife in him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he do, resist a mugger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like it, doesn\u0027t it? Guy I talked to said it doesn\u0027t really add up that way. Incidentally, he had more questions than answers for me. Watson was an affluent commodities broker, two kids in college, owned a nice home in a solid neighborhood. They want to solve this one, and the case is only four months old so they\u0027re not ready to give up on it. So why was I taking an interest, and what did I know that he didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember, something about we had a case with a similar MO. According to him, forensic evidence suggests Watson\u0027s killer surprised him from behind and got him in a choke hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muggers will do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then he promptly stabbed the poor bastard. Blade about four-and-a-half inches long, or anyway that\u0027s as far as he stuck it in. Stabbed him once, got the heart first shot, and death would have been instantaneous or close to it. Watson\u0027s wallet was gone, so either it was robbery or it was supposed to look like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose anybody saw it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"He wasn\u0027t down long, though. Rent-a-cop from a private security patrol found him, called it in right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you stab a guy if you\u0027ve already got him in a choke hold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been asking themselves the same question in Forest Hills. That\u0027s why my guy got very interested when I talked about a similar MO, and I had to let him down easy, say our perp was a slasher, not a stabber, no choke hold, di dah di dah di dah. Incidentally, why are people surprised when occasionally a cop lies in court? We lie all day long, it\u0027s part of the fucking job description. You didn\u0027t lie, you\u0027d never get any work done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It\u0027s the same thing working private. In fact it\u0027s worse, you\u0027ve got no power to threaten or intimidate because you\u0027ve got no legal authorization. So you have to con everybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All in the name of truth and justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in the service of a higher good. Don\u0027t forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s their thinking, Joe? Ordinary street crime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s their best guess,\" he said, \"but they\u0027re not married to it. It\u0027s hard to find anybody with a reason to kill Watson. He was married to the same woman for twenty-five years, and if either of them had anything going on the side nobody knows anything about it. Both of them well-liked, both of them active in the community. About a year ago he got phone threats from a client who blamed Watson for a beating he took. That\u0027s a financial beating, not two mutts holding you up in an alley while their buddy works on your rib cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The client checked out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The client moved to fucking Denver. Anyway, what kind of a grudge killing is that, a quick knife in the heart and make it look like robbery for profit? You want to get even with somebody, either you whip out a gun and make a little noise or you tear into him with a baseball bat, break his bones, and beat his fucking brains out. Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remind me never to get you mad at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, did I sound like I was really getting into it there?\" He grinned. \"I\u0027m ten days off cigarettes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed the ashtray was gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That snitch of Bellamy\u0027s, I wanted to tell him to blow some of that smoke in my direction. Not this time, though. This time I\u0027m not sneaking drags on other people\u0027s cigarettes, or checking ashtrays for a butt long enough to relight. This time I get it right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s moments when I could kill the whole world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027d better stay on your good side,\" I said, and drew an unsealed envelope from my hip pocket and slipped it among the papers on his desk. He glanced around, lifted the flap, and counted the contents without removing the bills from the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two bills, hundreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couple of suits,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s low-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s fine,\" he said. \"What did I do, use the phone on the city\u0027s time? I\u0027m happy. But it\u0027s not enough, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I mean? I want to know what it\u0027s about. You\u0027re looking for information on four homicides over a twelve-year stretch, all of them unsolved-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cloonan was solved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look. \"I stuck my neck out,\" he said, \"and I can use the suits, but I want to know what\u0027s going on. If you\u0027ve got something that can break these cases, you can\u0027t just sit on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have anything, Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What case are you working? Who\u0027s your client?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" I said, \"one reason a person goes to somebody like me is to keep things confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I figure,\" he said, watching me carefully, \"is AA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t be the first time you got a client who knew you from your AA meetings. There\u0027s things you have to do when you get sober, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you have to do is not drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but isn\u0027t there a whole program? Almost like going to confession, but instead of a couple of Hail Marys you make restitution, set things straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Cleaning up the wreckage of the past,\u0027 \" I said, quoting one of the immortal phrases from the literature. \"Say, Joe, if you think you\u0027re interested, I\u0027ll be happy to take you to a meeting sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you just wanted to see what it was like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I repeat, fuck you. And quit changing the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one who brought up AA. I never realized you had a problem, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, why do I tolerate you? What I was starting to say, I figure you know somebody from AA who\u0027s got guilty knowledge of some crimes, including the four homicides we\u0027ve been talking about. I wouldn\u0027t want to think you\u0027re gonna sit on something that ought to be brought out and looked at. Whoever did the gay fellow, Uhl, is probably dead himself by now, and Cloonan\u0027s file\u0027s closed for the time being, but the boys in the One-oh would love to catch a break in the Shipton case, and Watson, Jesus, the body\u0027s barely cold, that\u0027s still an active investigation. If you know anything, it should get channeled to the right people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s probably a way to keep your client out of it, at least in the early stages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. \"Your client didn\u0027t do all four guys himself, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You answered that one awfully quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I knew you were going to ask it. And the answer didn\u0027t require a whole lot of thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not. Matt-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to give him something. Without planning to, I said, \"They knew each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They? Meaning your client and who? Wait a minute. The vics knew each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they all do, wipe out some Vietnamese village together and some slope\u0027s looking to get even?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were part of a group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A group? What kind of a group?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a fraternity,\" I said. \"They got together once in a while to have dinner and compare notes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Bet my note\u0027s bigger than your note.\u0027 Let\u0027s see, you got a commodities broker, a famous artist, a cabdriver, and a faggot. That\u0027s a hell of a fraternity. Wait a minute, was this a gay thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure of that? Shipton and his wife ran in a kind of a kinky crowd. Wouldn\u0027t surprise me to hear he swung from both sides of the plate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t surprise me to hear it about anybody,\" I said, \"but this wasn\u0027t about sex. I can\u0027t go into details without clearing it with my client, but there\u0027s nothing out of the ordinary about the group. The only thing unusual is that four of them have been murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How big\u0027s the group?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Around thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty men and four of \u0027em murdered, Jesus, that\u0027s high even for New York.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Same killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason to think that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but you think it yourself, don\u0027t you? You asked if a single killer could\u0027ve done the Shiptons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never forget a thing, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I can help it. You got a suspect? A motive? Anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t say level with me, Matt, but don\u0027t hold out the moon and the stars on me, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not holding out anything concrete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and what the hell does that mean? What\u0027s the opposite of concrete?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asphalt,\" I suggested. \"Plaster of Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve years between Uhl and Watson,\" he said, \"you\u0027re talking about a killer who likes to take his time. The other twenty-six guys, time he gets around to them they\u0027ll be too old to care. You know what he\u0027s like, this guy? He\u0027s prostate cancer. By the time he kills you you\u0027re already dead of something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a message from Wally Donn at the hotel desk. \"I\u0027ll be here for the next hour,\" he said when I called. \"I\u0027ve got those credit reports for you, and something else you\u0027ll like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst I called TJ on his beeper.
