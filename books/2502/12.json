{"id":106677,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eFor the last three days, Roma had been unseasonably warm for early March, the skies clear and limpid, the air soft, stirring the trees into buds and bringing the Romans out of their houses in great numbers, so that the fora and the streets were filled with people enjoying the burgeoning spring. Even the Emperor had joined in the occasion, escorted about the major avenues of the city by a throng of handsome young men in new tunicae with Heliogabalus\u0027 sun on their chests as a sign of affiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnmoved by the balmy weather, Telemachus Batsho hurried along the edge of the street leading to the Palatinus Hill, a leather case clasped under his arm, and a burning determination in his heart. \"Thinks he\u0027ll make a fool of me,\" he muttered repeatedly as he went along, each step like an assault on the ground. \"Using that foreigner to hide his profits. He won\u0027t make a fool out of me.\" Reaching the house of Septimus Desiderius Vulpius, he demanded admittance from the footman at the front door, and then asked to see Vulpius himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The master is away from home just now,\" said the footman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\" Batsho asked, his patience thoroughly frayed. \"I must speak with him at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need not answer him,\" said a voice from the end of the peristyle; Leontius came forward, his manner deferential but his old eyes suspicious. \"What is your purpose here, humiliorus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the decuria Telemachus Batsho, and I have come to discuss a matter of importance with your master, having to do with questions raised about his records,\" he said, making no effort to hide his indignation: humiliorus indeed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant nothing to the decuria\u0027s discredit,\" said Leontius without any trace of servility. \"As you have your tasks, I have mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly comparable,\" sniffed Batsho, appalled at himself for arguing with a slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But equally necessary,\" said Leontius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall mention this to your master,\" Batsho threatened, wanting this most unseemly exchange to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good decuria, I regret that I must tell you my master is presently at his estates in the north, attending to spring planting in his orchards and vineyards, and to be present at his cousin Caia\u0027s wedding. My master and his family will return in two weeks if all goes well. If you would like to be notified when he is once again in Roma, or would you prefer to dispatch a messenger to him from the basilica?\" Leontius studied Batsho in a manner not quite courteous. \"If your mission is not so pressing, I will be honored to inform my master of your visit immediately upon his return. He will then be able to prepare whatever accounts you want to review.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt. No doubt,\" Batsho said, almost spitting the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the matter is truly urgent, I am authorized to send a messenger to him-is it urgent?\" asked Leontius in a tone that implied he knew it was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not precisely urgent, no,\" Batsho conceded. \"But it is potentially complicated, and pressing, and may require his attention for some time once he is available to answer questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeontius saw the change in Batsho\u0027s demeanor, and modified his question. \"How do you want me to explain your request to my master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not going to tell a slave such things,\" said Batsho, trying to decide how much to impart to the steward; if this man was like most of the stewards in Roma, he knew the family\u0027s business better than they, themselves, did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish, decuria,\" said Leontius, preparing to close the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be certain I shall come back once your master is at home,\" Batsho said, hating the lack of determination he heard in his voice-more of a whine than a clarion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will inform him,\" said Leontius, closing the door firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho stood in front of the door for a short while, trying to think of what he ought to do next. He was not convinced that he should return to the Basilica Julia too quickly, for there were many-his slave Tuccu included-who might assume he had failed at his task; it stung him to think that he had. Surely there were others he could visit on official business. He paced to the end of the wall, stopped, then peered up into the sky as if seeking inspiration there. After a short while he snapped his fingers and set out to the east, away from the Forum Romanum and the Basilica Julia. There was still something he might be able to do, something that no one would question. He walked briskly toward the Temple of Hercules, gathering purpose as he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVitellius admitted him to the house of Domina Clemens. \"My master is busy in his study. Shall I send for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was more the reception Batsho expected, and he made himself stand as tall as possible. \"Yes. He will want to talk in a withdrawing room, I believe.\" His smile was self-serving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will have wine and bread fetched for you,\" said Vitellius, indicating a door across the atrium from where they stood. \"It should not be long in being brought to you, honored decuria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" said Batsho, and went briskly past the fountain to the beautiful wooden doors of the withdrawing room. He let himself in and took stock of the chamber, making note of the magnificent hanging fixture that held more than a dozen oil-lamps, and the two couches and three chairs, all upholstered in costly fabrics, reminding himself to check the records of the luxury taxes Sanct-Franciscus had paid. Two tables of glossy carved wood stood between the chairs and the couches. Certainly this foreigner was flourishing in Roma, he thought, as he dropped into one of the chairs and put his case in his lap; his heel tapped out his impatience. The shutters were open and revealed a small stand of peach trees just beginning to put out buds and leaves; Batsho only glanced at them before he again took stock of the contents of the room, mentally calculating the value of what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA discreet tap on the door announced the arrival of his refreshments, and Batsho called out, \"Enter,\" as he shifted his position in the chair so he could reach the nearest table without effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMareno brought in a tray with an amphora of wine on it, a goblet of gilded wood, and a basket of sweet buns and savory rolls stuffed with spiced cheese. He put the tray down and offered to pour the wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will attend to that,\" said Batsho, waving his dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a slight bow, Mareno withdrew, leaving the door slightly ajar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho poured out a generous amount of wine and picked up one of the sweet buns, sniffing at it before he bit into it. He chewed steadily but paid little attention to the taste, thinking of what he would tell Sanct-Franciscus. So intent was he on preparing his opening salvo, he did not realize that Sanct-Franciscus had arrived until a discreet cough behind him startled him out of his contemplation. Spraying bits of masticated bun, he burst out, \"What are you doing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcoming you to the house of Domina Clemens,\" said Sanct-Franciscus urbanely. \"I hope this means your refreshments are satisfactory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep a good kitchen,\" said Batsho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that subject to taxation? I was not aware of it,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, coming up to Batsho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Not that I know of,\" said Batsho, forcing a chuckle. \"Although, if such a tax did exist, you would have to pay handsomely, I expect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then to what do I owe the honor of your visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho contemplated the half of the sweet bun in his fingers. \"I have come about the business dealings you have with Septimus Desiderius Vulpius. There are some ... some gaps in our records that must be eliminated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The records or the gaps?\" Sanct-Franciscus inquired politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho stopped the sharp retort that formed in his thoughts; instead he cleared his throat portentously. \"Honestiorus, you are a man of probity, and so I come to you. You have certain business dealings that are under examination, and for that reason if no other, I come to you in the hope of reconciling the discrepancies in our accounts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have provided all the information requested in regard to all my business dealings,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"You yourself recorded them, and received your commoda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho blinked in surprise. \"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have your signature to that effect, or had you forgot?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked, his cordiality unalloyed, but his dark eyes took on a flintiness that had not been in them a moment ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to recover himself, Batsho managed an elaborate shrug. \"If you are disinclined to assist me, then I will have to refer the matter to the curia itself, for judgment.\" Usually this intimation was enough to make any Roman willing to cooperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sanct-Franciscus was not a Roman. He nodded to Batsho. \"I am sure the curia would be interested in what you report. As they would be interested in your attempt to solicit a bribe for your silence and complicity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not-\" Batsho began, only to be interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I have misunderstood your purpose in coming here, pardon me for my maladroitness,\" said Sanct-Franciscus with icy formality. \"If you are seeking to discover whether or not I am willing to bribe an official of the Roman Senate, I offer my assurance that I am not. I will pay the taxes I am assessed, I will pay the commodae required of me, but I will not contravene Roman laws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most commendable,\" said Batsho as he reached for the amphora to refill his goblet. \"You have received me hospitably, which is to your credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And suits your position, decuria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so, just so,\" said Batsho before he took a long draught of wine. Feeling somewhat better, he finished the sweet bun, then addressed Sanct-Franciscus again. \"It is laudable that you strive to conduct your affairs correctly. Not everyone is as conscientious as you are, and for that reason, I must compare your records to some others filed in association with yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very punctilious of you,\" Sanct-Franciscus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man in my position must be meticulous,\" said Batsho, trying not to preen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho cleared his throat. \"You may want to review your records, to determine if what you have reported is in any way dissimilar to what Vulpius has reported.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Vulpius returns to the city, I will speak with him,\" Sanct-Franciscus said. \"If we discover any divergence in our accounts, we will inform you of them, as Roman law requires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... thank you, for your ... cooperation and hospitality,\" said Batsho, although the words almost stuck in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no need for thanks; I am only doing my duty as a resident of Roma.\" Sanct-Franciscus inclined his head. \"If there is nothing else, I fear I must return to my work in the study. You may remain as long as you like; if this refreshment is insufficient, inform the steward and he will see that you have more of whatever pleases you.\" He gave Batsho a gesture of respect, then turned and left him alone with the wine and the basket of breads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you any instructions?\u0027 asked Aedius, who met Sanct-Franciscus outside the withdrawing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give him whatever he asks for; the more the better. Let me know when he is about to leave.\" Sanct-Franciscus managed a half-smile. \"I would appreciate it if no one mentioned the visitor in my study. I think it best if his presence were-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" said Aedius, indignation raising his voice a bit. \"Speak to a decuria of the household? I think not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should not have doubted you. If you would prepare another tray and have it brought to the study,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. He turned away after handing Aedius a denarius for his service, and made for his study, where he found Natalis, his big, long-fingered hands moving restlessly as he paced. \"I apologize for taking so long, particularly since you had not been here more than a few minutes when he arrived, and I have sent your refreshments to him. Had it been another, I would have asked him to wait until you and I had finished our business. But since the decuria required-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Decuriae are the bane of us all,\" said Natalis, trying to contain his temper. \"I don\u0027t like being in the same house as one, I can tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who among us does,\" Sanct-Franciscus said. \"This one has a singleness of purpose where I am concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis came to an abrupt halt. \"Are you suspect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No; I am rich,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"He would like to find a way to demand more commodae of me than the law allows, and so he pesters me and a few of my associates, hoping to force us into paying him additional sums. Unfortunately I have done so in the past, and that seems to have inspired him to regard me as a good target for his requirements: fortunately I have a record of what he has been paid, one that he has signed, and that limits his rapacity to some extent, for he would be dismissed from his post if it was revealed that he had taken bribes, or solicited additional commodae.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all take bribes,\" said Natalis. \"And most of them remain at their posts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but not so egregiously as this Batsho: he is an avaricious little man, who uses what small power he possesses to try to enrich himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like that Persian merchant. Dis take him!\" Natalis slapped his fist into his hand. \"I wish I had never entered his shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand that,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, continuing with delicacy, \"Did you actually take anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Natalis burst out, then pressed his lips together, and, under Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 penetrating gaze added, \"He had nothing worth my efforts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even the alabaster figures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They were of inferior workmanship. I have some standards; I will not risk prison for something that will fetch a few denarii, which is all those figures would have done, if I had taken any.\" He paused. \"I still lie, occasionally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the boy: does he work with you?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he really was asking for directions. Truly. It drew the shopkeeper\u0027s attention, and that made him suspect the worst.\" He cleared his throat. \"I do sometimes work with someone, but she is not ... she is over forty and no one pays her much attention, so she is most effective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she is ... ,\" Sanct-Franciscus prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are cousins. She is a widow of limited means, and she welcomes the extra money our efforts can bring; at forty-three, she is in no position to learn new skills-and even if she did, who would hire her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has she no other means?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis sighed abruptly. \"Her husband left her with a house, but his nephew claimed the house for his family, and the decuriae upheld his claim, so now my cousin lives in two little rooms in one of the insulae down near the slaughterhouses.\" He stared toward the window. \"I ask you not to betray her. I might manage prison or quarry-work, but she is too old for such sentences, and I would hate to see her go to the arena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not, nor will I expose you.\" Sanct-Franciscus indicated one of the chairs. \"Sit down. You will have food and drink shortly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning a little, Natalis moved away from Sanct-Franciscus. \"That isn\u0027t necessary. I am hardly your guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of course you are,\" Sanct-Franciscus contradicted him with a faint smile. \"I asked that you visit me upon your release. The Prefect assured me you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ... I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t, not at once,\" Natalis said, unaccountably embarrassed by this admission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct-Franciscus dismissed this with a wave of his hand. \"No matter; you are here now, your injury has healed and you look fit enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis paled. \"Fit enough for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct-Franciscus shook his head. \"Nothing that should trouble you. Nothing that would put you at odds with the law again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\" Natalis began, stopping himself as a tap sounded on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolmdi entered the study, bearing a well-laden brass tray: a large jug of wine stood surrounded by a silver goblet, a basket of breads, a tub of soft cheese, another of fresh butter, a plate of cold sliced chicken garnished with asparagus, a dish of preserved fruits, and a bowl of pickled vegetables. This he put down on the large table in the center of the room. \"I am sorry this took so long to bring, my master, but the decuria asked for more wine.\" He stood still, anticipating a rebuke and possibly a blow to go with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he?\" Sanct-Franciscus almost smiled. \"His head will ache from so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said to serve him whatever he asked for,\" Holmdi reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I did,\" Sanct-Franciscus agreed. \"And the household has done well in catering to him. If necessary, send for a sedan chair to carry him home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolmdi ducked his head and prepared to leave the study. \"Is there anything more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just now, thank you, Holmdi,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, and waited until the slave had left the room before turning his attention to Natalis once more. \"Go ahead. Take what pleases you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis was hungry and the food smelled delicious. \"I would like something to eat, and a glass of wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have as much as you want,\" Sanct-Franciscus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily Natalis would have refused to have more than wine and bread, but he had gone two days on such fare and was famished for something more substantial. \"If you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not join you. I have ... a condition that limits my diet severely, and as those of my blood dine in private. Do not let that make you reluctant. Your pleasure is all that matters here.\" He watched Natalis take one of the breads, pull it open and begin to smear soft cheese in the cavity, then reach for chicken slices and pickles and stuff them into the bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is most generous, honestioms.\" He turned away, as if worried that his eating might upset his host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing more than I would offer any other guest in your situation,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis, who had taken a large bite of his stuffed bread, stopped chewing. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have spent months in prison, and you have no employment to sustain you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have not yet found ... fitting work,\" said Natalis warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does nothing suit your abilities?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My abilities are somewhat limited,\" Natalis admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean that your skills are as a thief?\" Sanct-Franciscus suggested with unruffled calm; as Natalis nodded, he went on, \"You are not necessarily so constrained: that is only the application you have chosen for your talents. I would rather suppose you might do other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\" Natalis asked, interested in spite of himself. He resumed chewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Work for me. I need someone to carry messages and to guard this house. A man of your talents. should excel at both duties: you can make your way without drawing attention to yourself, and you can determine what parts of this house are vulnerable to thieves.\" His smile was ironic. \"You do know how to do both those things, do you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" said Natalis. \"I can do them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fear such work would lack excitement?\" Sanct-Franciscus proposed. \"I may soon have to dispatch a messenger to Alexandria. And many of my dealings are conducted under the rose. Do not fear that you would only fetch and carry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long, thoughtful moment, Natalis said, \"If I come to work for you, what then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will receive a place to live here, fifteen silver denarii a month for your labors, in addition to payment for every service you perform for me. I will pay you ten silver denarii today for agreeing to enter my service.\" Sanct-Franciscus knew the amount was generous, even in the debased coins of this time, and he expected Natalis to accept it. \"My only requirement beyond your service is that while you are in my employ, you will rob no one, steal nothing. And I would prefer that you do not lie to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis squirmed a bit. \"I will make an effort to comply.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will do more than that, or I will not engage you. Think, Natalis: a regular wage and valuable work to do. That should suffice even you.\" The glint of humor in his dark eyes took the sting out of his remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my cousin?\" Natalis inquired, pouring wine before taking another bite. \"Is there anything you can offer her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I might be able to arrange something,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, thinking of Melidulci, who was finding it difficult to find a woman-companion to lend her the appearance of propriety at her house away from the lupanar. \"I will try to find employment for her in some capacity that will not demean her. Will that suffice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t ask more than that,\" said Natalis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will accept my offer?\" Sanct-Franciscus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis considered his response. \"I will do so for a year. If at the end of the year either you or I am dissatisfied, then the arrangement will end. Is that satisfactory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of unmelodic singing interrupted them, and both Sanct-Franciscus and Natalis looked around, then realized that Telemachus Batsho was drunk and amusing himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems reasonable,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, recovering himself and holding out his hand to slap palms with Natalis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment, Natalis hesitated. \"Why are you employing me: you might buy a slave to do your bidding, and spend much less in the space of a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough,\" Sanct-Franciscus said. \"But I have found over time that a free man is likely to prove the more loyal servant than a slave.\" He did not elaborate on this, but his thoughts went back to slightly less than a century before, when Srau, in Fars, had very nearly brought about Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 True Death, all in the name of seeking manumission. \"I have slaves enough about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said Natalis, clapping his hand to Sanct-Franciscus\u0027, \"I am your servant for the terms we have agreed upon, for a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatsho\u0027s song grew louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I accept your conditions,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, shaking his head. \"What a wretched serenade to mark our business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t very good at singing,\" said Natalis, pouring out a little wine onto the floor before drinking. \"For good fortune and the favor of the gods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them,\" Sanct-Franciscus concurred. \"Including the forgotten ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a letter from Vettrinis the Gaul, at Vetera Castra in Germania Inferior, to Ragoczy Germainus Sanct-Franciscus in Roma, carried by merchant\u0027s courier and delivered two months after it was dispatched due to weather and being intercepted and read before it reached Roma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my most highly esteemed commercial partner, the greetings from Vettrinis the Gaul, with distressing news from Vetera Castra in Germania Inferior:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the winter just past, the Cherusci came over the river and raided throughout the immediate region, seizing goods, marauding for livestock, killing, and taking slaves. The end result of this is that the shepherds with whom we have so often done business have, through no fault of theirs, no wool to sell, and so our projected earnings will be reduced by at least a third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am attempting to find other shepherds and farmers with fleece to sell, but many others are doing the same, and that has meant that the price for wool has risen steeply. I am at something of a loss to know what I should do, for the prices will certainly remain high in this region, and others may raise their prices, as well, to take advantage of the immediate shortages. I may return to Belgica and hope that the situation is better there, or I may go north, hoping that the wild men in the marshes have wool available. The marshes have not been raided, at least not yet, but they are. nearer to danger than Gallia Belgica is, and that gives me pause. When I have decided, I will send you word of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winter has been hard, which probably accounts for the raids, and spring is slow in coming. I foresee a difficult year for everyone in Germania Inferior, and probably not much better in Germania Superior. In addition, due to avalanches, and a bad flood in February, there are breaks in the road leading into Italia, and this, in turn, has slowed commerce still more. It may take this letter longer to reach you than the usual three weeks, and for that I apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn your recommendation, I am, trading in aurei, not denarii, and, as you predicted, I have found, the few merchants and factors with whom I am dealing more willing to engage in trade for gold, since the aurei are not as debased as the denarii have been. Who would have thought that the Roman denarius could lose so much of its value, and so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are tales being told of the young Emperor-that he is willful and extravagant beyond imagination, that he keeps favorites openly and has little interest in government, leaving such matters to his mother and grandmother while he amuses himself in outlandish feasts and festivities. He is young, and that may account for some of his thoughtlessness, but they say that he has failed to resupply many of the Legions posted on borders such as ours. If this is true, it is a sad thing for Roma and the Empire, and I fear we may expect more raids such as those of last winter. Who knows, if they are unpaid for much longer, the Legions may become the raiders, and then who will be safe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish to assure you that I will do my utmost to secure enough wool to bring us both a profit this season, but that may not be possible. I ask you to hold yourself in patience while this region recovers from, the troubles it has sustained. This, on the 9th day of March in the 972nd Year of the City, by my own hand,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVettrinis\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emerchant of Gallia Belgica \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19/page-12.html","bookId":2502,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:44 PM"}
