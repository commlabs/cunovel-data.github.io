They\u0027ve given us a permit to live in the Valles Marineris, and don\u0027t think we haven\u0027t been waiting for a year and a half because we have. They\u0027re so slow and they keep talking about the capital investment required to make the place livable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValles Marineris sounds good as an address, but we just call it the Canyon, and I don\u0027t know why they\u0027re so worried about its being livable. It\u0027s the Martian Riviera, if you ask me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first place, it\u0027s warmer down here than it is in the rest of Mars, a good ten degrees (Celsius) warmer. The air is thicker-thin enough, heaven knows-but thicker and a better protection against ultraviolet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the main difficulty is getting in and out of the Canyon. It\u0027s four miles deep in places and they\u0027ve built roads here and there so that you can get down in special mobiles. Getting up and out is more difficult, but with gravity only two-fifths what it is on Earth, it isn\u0027t as bad as it sounds, and they do say they\u0027re going to build elevators that will take us at least partway up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem is, of course, that dust storms do tend to accumulate in the Canyon more than on the ordinary surface, and there are landslides now and then, but heavens, we don\u0027t worry about that. We know where the faults are and where the landslides are likely to occur and no one digs in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the thing, Mabel. After all, everyone on Mars lives under a dome or underground, but here in the Canyon, we can dig in sideways, which I understand is much preferable from an engineering standpoint, though I\u0027ve asked Bill not to try to explain it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, we can heat out some of the ice crystals, so that we don\u0027t have to depend on the government for all the water we need. There is more ice down in the Canyon than elsewhere and, for another, it\u0027s easier to manufacture the air, keep it inside the diggings, and circulate it when you\u0027re in horizontally instead of down vertically. That\u0027s what Bill says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027ve been thinking about it, Mabel. Where\u0027s the need to leave the Canyon, anyway? It\u0027s over three thousand miles long and in the end there are going to be diggings all along it. It\u0027s going to be a huge city, and I\u0027ll bet you most of the population of Mars will end up here. Can\u0027t you see it? There\u0027s to be some kind of maglev rail running the length of the Canyon and communication will be easy. The government ought to put every bit of money it can into developing it. It will make Mars a great world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill says (you know what he\u0027s like-all enthusiasm) that the time will come when they will roof in the whole Canyon. Instead of having air just in separate diggings, and having to put on a spacesuit when you want to travel about, we will have a huge world of normal air and low gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said to him that the landslides might break the dome and we would lose all the air. He said that the dome could be built in separate sections and that any break would automatically shut off the affected areas. I asked him how much all that would cost. He said, \"What\u0027s the difference? It will be done little by little, over the centuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0027s his job here, now. He\u0027s got his master\u0027s license as an Areo-engineer, and he\u0027s got to work out new ways to make the Canyon diggings even better. That\u0027s why we got our new place here and it looks as though Mars is going to be our oyster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may not live to see it ourselves, but if our great-grandchildren make it to 2140, a century from now, we\u0027ll have a world that may well overshadow Earth itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be wonderful. We\u0027re very excited, Mabel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours, Gladys.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gold-the-final-science-fiction-collection/page-7.html","bookId":1733,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}
