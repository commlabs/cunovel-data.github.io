Meredith, who\u0027d gotten much less sleep but heard much more alarming news, was looking like a razor blade: keen, sharp as ice, and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing else to see except Damon with his paper bags on the seat beside him, driving the Prius. Out the windows, where an arid Arizona dawn should be blinding its way across the horizon, was nothing but fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was frightening and disorienting. They had taken a small road off Highway 179 and, gradually, the fog had crept in, sending tendrils of mist around the car, and finally engulfing it whole. It seemed to Elena that they were being deliberately cut off from the old ordinary world of McDonald\u0027s and Target, and were crossing a border into a place they weren\u0027t meant to know about, much less go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no traffic in the other direction. None at all. And as hard as Elena peered out of her window, it was like trying to look through fast-moving clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we going too fast?\" Bonnie asked, rubbing her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Damon said. \"It would be - a remarkable coincidence - if anyone else were on the same route at the same time we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks a lot like Arizona,\" she said, disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may be Arizona, for all I know,\" Damon replied. \"But we haven\u0027t crossed the Gate yet. And this isn\u0027t anywhere in Arizona you could just accidentally walk into. The path always has its little tricks and traps. The problem is that you never know what you\u0027ll be facing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now listen,\" he added, looking at Elena with an expression she had gotten to know. It meant: I\u0027m not joking around; I\u0027m talking to you as an equal; I\u0027m serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve gotten very good at showing only a human-sized aura,\" Damon said. \"But that means that if you can learn one more thing before we go in, you can actually use your aura, make it do you some good when you want it to, instead of just hiding it until it pops up out of control and lifts three-thousand-pound cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what kind of good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what I\u0027m going to show you. First of all just relax and let me control it. Then, little by little, I\u0027ll slacken the controls and you\u0027ll take them up. By the end, you should be able to send your Powers to your eyes - and see much better; to your ears - and hear much better; to your limbs - and move much more quickly and precisely. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t have taught me this before we started on this little excursion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her, a wild, reckless smile that made her smile, too, even if she didn\u0027t know what it was about. \"Until you showed how well you could control your aura throughout the path - the way here - I didn\u0027t think you were ready,\" he said bluntly. \"Now I do. There are things in your mind just waiting to be unlocked. You\u0027ll understand when we unlock them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we unlock them - with what? A kiss? Elena thought suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No. And that\u0027s the other reason you\u0027ve got to learn this. Your telepathy is getting out of hand. If you don\u0027t learn how to keep from projecting your thoughts, you\u0027ll never make it past the checkpoint at the Gate as a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheckpoint. That sounded ominous. Elena nodded and said, \"All right; what do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we did before. Like I said, relax. Try to trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his right hand just to the left of her breastbone, not touching the cloth of her deep gold top. Elena could feel herself flushing, and she wondered what Bonnie and Meredith must think of this if they were watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Elena felt something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t cold; it wasn\u0027t heat, but it was something like the furthest extremities of both of them. It was pure Power. It would have knocked her over if Damon hadn\u0027t been holding her by the arm with his other hand. She thought, he\u0027s using his own Power to prime mine, to do something -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- something that hurt -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Elena tried, vocally and telepathically, to tell Damon that the Power was too much, that it hurt. But Damon ignored her pleas even as he ignored the tears that spilled onto her cheeks. His Power was leading hers now, painfully, throughout her body. It was in her bloodstream, dragging her own Power behind it like a comet\u0027s tail. It was forcing her to take the Power to different parts of her body and let it build and build there, not letting her exhale it, not letting her move it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to burst -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this time her eyes had been fixed on Damon\u0027s, broadcasting her feelings to him: from indignant anger to shock to agonized pain - and now...to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of her Power went on circling, without causing any pain. Each new breath she drew added more Power to it, but it simply circulated through her bloodstream, not increasing her aura, but increasing the Power that was inside her. After two or three more quick breaths she realized that she was doing it effortlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Elena\u0027s Power wasn\u0027t simply sliding around smoothly inside her, looking from the outside like any other human\u0027s. It was also filling several burst swollen nodes inside her and where it did that, it changed things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that she was looking at Damon with round eyes. He might have told her about how this would feel, rather than letting her go into it blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou really are a total bastard, aren\u0027t you? Elena thought, and, amazingly, she could feel Damon receive the thought, and could feel his automatic response, which was pleased agreement, rather than otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Elena forgot about him in the dawning of a new understanding. She was realizing that she could keep circulating her Power inside her, and even build it higher and higher, getting ready for a truly explosive burst, and show nothing of what it was doing on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as for the nodes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena looked around her at what a few minutes ago had been barren wilderness. It was like taking bullets of light through both her eyes. She was dazzled; she was enthralled. Colors seemed to come to life in a painful glory. She felt that she could see much farther than she ever had, on and on into the desert, and at the same time, she could distinguish Damon\u0027s pupils from his irises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, they\u0027re both black, but different shades of black, she thought. Of course, they go together - Damon would never have irises that didn\u0027t complement his pupils. But the irises are more velvety, where his pupils are more silky and shiny. And yet it\u0027s a velvet that can hold light inside it - almost like the night sky with stars - like those kitsune star balls that Meredith told me about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now those pupils were wide and set unyieldingly on her face, as if Damon didn\u0027t want to miss a moment of her reaction. Suddenly, the corner of his lip quirked in a faint smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it. You learned to channel your Power to your eyes.\" He spoke in a bare whisper that she could never have detected before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to my ears,\" she whispered back, listening to the amazing symphony of tiny sounds around her. High in the air, a bat squeaked on a frequency too high for any ordinary human ear to notice. As for the fall of grains of sand around her, they formed something like a tiny concerto as they struck rock and bounced with a tiny ping before falling to the ground below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is amazing, she told Damon, hearing the smugness in her own telepathic voice. And I can talk to you this way any time now? She would have to watch out for that - telepathy threatened to reveal more than she might want to send to a recipient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s best to be careful, Damon agreed, confirming her suspicions. She\u0027d sent more than she\u0027d meant to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Damon - can Bonnie do this, too? Should I try to show her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" Damon replied aloud, making Elena wince. \"Teaching humans how to use Power isn\u0027t exactly my forte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about my different Wings Powers? Will I be able to control them, now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About those I have absolutely no idea. I\u0027ve never seen anything like them.\" Damon looked thoughtful for a moment and then shook his head. \"I think you\u0027d need someone with more experience than I have to learn to control those.\" Before Elena could say anything else, he added, \"We\u0027d better get back to the others. We\u0027re almost at the Gate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I suppose I shouldn\u0027t be using telepathy then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is a rather obvious giveaway - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ll teach me later, won\u0027t you? As much as you know about controlling Power?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe your boyfriend should be doing that,\" Damon said almost roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s afraid, Elena thought, trying to keep her thoughts hidden under a wall of white noise so that Damon wouldn\u0027t pick them up. He\u0027s just as afraid that he\u0027ll reveal too much to me as I am afraid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-shadow-souls-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-13.html","bookId":2036,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM"}
