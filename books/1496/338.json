The ground around Bai Xiaochun shattered, and many objects in the area exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Bai Xiaochun was badly shaken, and found himself staggering backward several steps from the force of the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face flickered as he looked up and saw a young man flying through the air toward him. He had long, wild hair, and his eyes burned red with killing intent as he closed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his speed couldn’t be counted for much within the Gold Core stage, it was vastly beyond anything Foundation Establishment cultivators were capable of. The majestic sight caused Foundation Establishment cultivators from both sides of the conflict in the jungle to be completely shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, alarmed cries could be heard. “A Gold Core cultivator!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe River-Defying Sect had dispatched people to lock down all of the enemy Gold Core experts, to prevent them from attacking the Foundation Establishment cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, for some unknown reason, a Gold Core cultivator had suddenly appeared right here, and was bearing down on Bai Xiaochun with murderous intentions. Some distance behind him was one of the River-Defying Sect’s Gold Core cultivators, who was racing to block his path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even as the River-Defying Sect Gold Core elder was about to intercept the young man from the Sky River Court, the young man waved his hand, sending a green beam of light shooting backward. Moments later, a huge skybanyan treant emerged from the light!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skybanyan treant was the young man’s battle weapon, something that he normally would care for just as much as his own life. However, after summoning the battle weapon, the young man cried out in a frantic voice, “Buy me ten breaths of time, even if you have to pay for it with your life!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor ran through the skybanyan treant, but it didn’t hesitate for even a moment. Energy surging, it shot forward and blocked the Gold Core elder from the River-Defying Sect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man’s murderous aura surged sky-high as he shot toward Bai Xiaochun, his eyes so bloodshot they were almost bleeding. He had only been in the Gold Core stage for about half a year, but he was completely and utterly confident that he would only need ten breaths of time to kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of the young woman’s severed head tumbling off to the side moments ago had filled him with intense pain. She had been his Daoist partner, his Junior Sister, and he had already sworn an oath to himself that he would personally kill the one responsible for her death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Die!!” he howled, smashing his hand toward Bai Xiaochun. The wave of his hand was backed by an early Gold Core cultivation base, causing a black palm to appear that screamed through the air toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt radiated a terrifying aura that no Foundation Establishment cultivator could possibly stand up against, and even caused the air to distort as it sped along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the face of such a murderous aura, Bai Xiaochun immediately began to fall back, his pupils constricting. A sense of deadly crisis overtook him, causing his flesh and blood to scream that he was in incredible danger!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to contemplate the situation, and he knew that he couldn’t rely on someone to intervene. Although people would come to rescue him eventually, he would have to hold out until that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one thought running through his mind at the moment....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t die here. If I want to stay alive, then I have to fight!!” Bai Xiaochun sped backward rapidly, performing a double-handed incantation gesture that summoned three huge violet cauldrons, along with numerous spirit enhanced flying swords, all of which flew to block the enormous hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose three cauldrons could be considered astonishingly powerful in the Foundation Establishment stage, but the hand summoned by the Gold Core young man completely destroyed them one after another. As for the spirit enhanced flying swords, as soon as the hand touched them, they began to fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand destroyed them all like a hammer crushing ice cubes, then proceeded on toward Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense rumbling sounds could be heard. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth, and his entire body flickered with gold light as his Undying Skin erupted with power to defend against an early Gold Core attack. Although he was sent tumbling backward, he was not killed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killing intent in the young man’s eyes grew stronger. Without uttering a single word, he advanced, viciously waving his sleeve to summon a black wind. The black wind quickly transformed into a black dragon, which let out a powerful roar as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time for thought or planning. Roaring, Bai Xiaochun opened his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, causing violet light to erupt out. At the same time, his little wooden sword appeared, shining with the dazzling silver light that came from multiple spirit enhancements. Bai Xiaochun wasn’t just defending himself, he was fighting back!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the power of the Heavenspan Dharma Eye locked onto the black dragon, the dragon roared and began to struggle. Although intense pain stabbed through the eye into Bai Xiaochun, he continued to unleash its power until the black dragon began to show signs of imminent destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLips twisted into a sneer, the young man said, “Can the light of a tiny firefly dare to contend with the glory of the shining moon?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he advanced again. At the same time, rumbling sounds could be heard as the black dragon began to grow larger, sloughing off the effects of the Heavenspan Dharma eye. Bai Xiaochun coughed up some blood, and blood even began to ooze out of his third eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little wooden sword continued to speed through the air, and when it hit the black dragon, a booming sound could be heard. The Gold Core young man\u0027s eyes then went wide as he saw the sword pass completely through the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was merely a stab wound. The difference in cultivation base between Bai Xiaochun and the young man was too vast. Without even a pause, the black dragon roared and headed toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon hadn’t even touched him, and yet his entire body was wracked with pain. Even his bones felt like they were creaking, and his qi and blood were in chaos. Madness began to rise up in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, he could see several beams of light racing urgently toward him; clearly, those were the patriarchs coming to rescue him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, they were too far off. If he couldn’t continue to hang on for a little bit longer, the patriarchs wouldn’t be able to help him. Although he feared death, he was also aware that such fear would do him no good right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Asura Body!” he roared. His Undying Gold Skin was operating at full power, causing golden light to shine out from him in all directions. At the same time, the manifestation of the second volume of the Undying Codex, the Asura Body, appeared. Instantly, his fleshly body power rocketed up as he prepared to face the incoming black dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge boom filled the air when the dragon slammed into his chest. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and the dragon collapsed into numerous strands of black mist. Bai Xiaochun’s body trembled on the verge of collapse as he was thrown backward. Even as he did, a shout of rage could be heard from the young man, who burst through the remnants of the black dragon toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the young man’s palm was bearing down on Bai Xiaochun’s chest!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment before it struck, enraged shouts could be heard from the patriarchs. Heaven and earth shook violently, and the Gold Core youth began to tremble. However, he ignored everything around them, gritting his teeth as he shoved his palm forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re dead!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadness could be seen in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes as well. He knew that there was no way he could avoid this blow. Therefore, he raised his right hand, and black light shimmered from his thumb and index finger as he sent the Throat Crushing Grasp toward the young man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, rumbling echoed out as the young man grabbed Bai Xiaochun’s right hand with his left and twisted it to the side. Cracking sounds could be heard as bones were broken, and pain surged through Bai Xiaochun. An expression of madness twisted his face; clearly, he was about to do something completely outrageous. Even as his right arm was wrenched to the side, and a palm strike was about to land on his chest, he used the Mountain Shaking Bash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a case of \u003cem\u003eeven if I die, I\u0027m going to make sure you feel some pain!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds could be heard as the Mountain Shaking Bash was unleashed, and Bai Xiaochun shot forward. He couldn’t prevent his hand from being crushed, nor could he block the incoming palm strike. So, he chose to simply body-slam the Gold Core youth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the destructive palm strike slammed into his chest, a black glow could be seen as the turtle-wok appeared to defend him. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth; he had been injured, but not killed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all you\u0027ve got?!” Bai Xiaochun said, smiling even as blood oozed out of his mouth. His vision was blurred, and he could barely move. Since that was the case, he decided that he might as well use what little energy he had left to force his nine spiritual seas to merge together!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he did that, he would reach the Gold Core stage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, such an act would be preceded by much preparation, but as of this moment, Bai Xiaochun was going to attempt to force it to happen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for his Gold Core opponent, after being hit by the Mountain Shaking Bash, he was flung backward, and coughed up a huge mouthful of blood. Then he looked over at Bai Xiaochun with complete disbelief and shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Foundation Establishment cultivator can actually hurt me? And that wok, it actually blocked my extermination strike?!” The young man’s killing intent grew stronger than ever when he realized that Bai Xiaochun was still not dead. Madness gleamed in his eyes, and he gritted his teeth. Despite the fact that people were only moments away from intervening and rescuing his target, he drew upon the full power of his Gold Core cultivation base and shot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that Bai Xiaochun was so grievously wounded, he was sure that one final attack would be enough to kill him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was his last chance to kill Bai Xiaochun before he himself was killed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might die, but you\u0027re going to die first!” he roared, picking up speed!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-335\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-337\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-336","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
