Calm, open sky, cool nights, many clear, clear tones and dear sounds in the woods and fields. The earth was resting, vast and peaceful . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have not heard anything from Herr Mack about the two guillemots I shot,” I said to the Doctor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can thank Edwarda for that,” he said. “I know. I heard that she set herself against it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I do not thank her for it,” said I . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Indian summer — Indian summer. The stars lay like belts in through the yellowing woods; a new star came every day. The moon showed like a shadow; a shadow of gold dipped in silver . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Heaven help you, Eva, are you married?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Didn’t you know that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I didn’t know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She pressed my hand silently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “God help you, child, what are we to do now?” “What you will. Perhaps you are not going away just yet; I will be happy as long as you are here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, Eva.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, yes — only as long as you are here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked forsaken, kept pressing my hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, Eva. Go — never any more!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e * * * * *\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nights pass and days come — three days already since this last talk. Eva comes by with a load. How much wood has that child carried home from the forest this summer alone?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Set the load down, Eva, and let me see if your eyes are as blue as ever.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her eyes were red.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No — smile again, Eva! I can resist no more; I am your, I am yours . . . ”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Evening. Eva sings, I hear her singing, and a warmth goes through me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are singing this evening, child?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, I am happy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And being smaller than I, she jumps up a little to put her arms round my neck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But, Eva, you have scratched your hands. Herregud! oh, if you had not scratched them so!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It doesn’t matter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her face beams wonderfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Eva, have you spoken to Herr Mack?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, once.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did he say, and what did you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is so hard with us now; he makes my husband work day and night down at the quay, and keeps me at all sorts of jobs as well. He has ordered me to do man’s work now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why does he do that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eva looks down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why does he do that, Eva?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Because I love you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But how could he know?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I told him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Would to Heaven he were not so harsh with you, Eva.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter at all now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And her voice is like a little tremulous song in the woods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e * * * * *\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woods more yellow still. It is drawing towards autumn now; a few more stars have come in the sky, and from now on the moon looks like a shadow of silver dipped in gold. There is no cold; nothing, only a cool stillness and a flow of life in the woods. Every tree stands in silent thought. The berries are ripe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then — the twenty-second of August and the three iron nights. [Footnote: Joernn?tter.
