{"id":8434,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. CATCHING A BURGLAR.","content":"\u0026nbsp;CARDEN had not the least suspicion that he was observed. The Tarbox farm-house stood rather aloof from the village, and the barn, as we have already stated, was at some distance from the house. He worked away calmly, feeling that there was no danger of his being interfered with. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At last he reached the box, and stooping lifted it complacently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Tarbox became very much agitated when he saw his hoard in the possession of the burglar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can\u0027t we get at him?\" he asked of Anak in an agitated whisper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" whispered Anak. \"Our best plan is to wait for him, and seize him as he leaves the barn.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But he will have my money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course he will. We will catch him with the stolen property in his possession.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But it isn\u0027t safe for him to have it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 172\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It won\u0027t be safe for him, I\u0027m thinking,\" said Anak, dryly. \"Don\u0027t you see if we reveal ourselves now he will blow out the candle and remain where he is, and we can\u0027t catch him in the dark. Ten to one he\u0027ll get off with the money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarbox saw that the giant was right. In spite of his agitation, he couldn\u0027t help remarking that Anak spoke English with remarkable ease—for a Norwegian, and he said so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Anak laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh well,\" he said, \"it\u0027s a good while since I was in Norway.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t speak so loud, you two,\" said Charlie Davis, whose eye was glued to the crevice. \"He\u0027ll hear you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The boy is right,\" said Anak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is he coming this way yet?\" asked Tarbox, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not yet; he is sitting down, counting the money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarbox groaned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I—I\u0027d like to choke him—the thief!\" he muttered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can\u0027t you find a better savings bank, friend Tarbox?\" said Anak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 173\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m afraid of savings banks. They break sometimes,\" answered the farmer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At any rate the money would be safer there than here, and you would get interest for it besides. But for us, or rather for Charlie here, who watched that rascal this afternoon, you\u0027d have had to bid a long good-by to your money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s got through counting it,\" said Charlie, who was still watching, \"and he\u0027s putting it in his pocket.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall never see it again!\" murmured Tarbox, sadly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes you will—we\u0027ve got the man as secure as a rat in a rat-trap. He\u0027ll have to come out this way, won\u0027t he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, he\u0027ll have to come up through the trap-door.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If he hadn\u0027t the money, it would be well to fasten down the trap-door, and keep him locked up there for the night. As it is, we shall have to secure him, and carry him to the station-house ourselves.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We might put him back under the barn after we\u0027ve taken the money from him,\" suggested Charlie Davis.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 174\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He may have matches with him,\" said Anak, \"and in that case he might set the barn on fire out of revenge. He\u0027s an ugly customer, that Carden, and is capable of anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, no, let him go!\" said Tarbox, alarmed at the suggestion of losing his barn by fire. \"Take the money from him and send him off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, no; we won\u0027t let him off so easy,\" said Anak. \"There\u0027s another matter we must inquire into. We must find out whether he is the man that threw the rock at Robert\u0027s horse to-night. If so, he must be punished for that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile, and this conversation took a much briefer time than may be imagined, Carden had ascended the ladder, emerged through the trap-door, which he had left open when he went down, and, with his ill-gotten booty stowed away in his pockets, had reached the small door by which he entered. He came out quite unconscious of danger, when he felt a strong hand at his collar, and his startled look fell upon the giant and his two companions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s all this?\" he asked, in affected bravado. \"Let go of me, Anak.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You villain!\" exclaimed the farmer, furiously; \"give me back my money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 175\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your money, old potato digger!\" returned Carden. \"Who\u0027s got your money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You have.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s a lie. How could I get hold of your money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What have you been doing in the barn?\" asked Anak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Lying down on the hay, if you must know,\" returned Carden. \"I got turned out of my boarding-place because I couldn\u0027t pay my board, and I thought Old Turnip-Top here wouldn\u0027t mind my getting a free bed lying on his hay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s a lie,\" said Tarbox, in excitement; \"you\u0027ve got my money in your pocket—three or four hundred dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where did I get hold of it? Do you keep money in your barn?\" sneered the canvas man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Carden, it\u0027s no use pretending ignorance; you found out that our friend here had money concealed under the barn floor—Charlie saw you spying this afternoon—and you thought to-night would be a good chance to secure it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So that boy blabbed about me, did he?\" said Carden, with an evil glance at Charlie. \"He\u0027d best look out, or I\u0027ll serve him as I did—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 176\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here he stopped short; but Charlie finished his sentence for him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As you did Rob to-night,\" he added; \"that\u0027s what you mean.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" said the canvas man, finding he had said too much.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know well enough!\" said Anak, sternly, for he liked Robert, and was incensed against the man who had tried to do him such grievous harm. \"You know well enough what the boy means; you were seen in the tent this evening, and it was you who threw the rock at Robert Rudd\u0027s horse.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can\u0027t prove it, and it\u0027s a lie!\" said Carden, defiantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Make him give up the money,\" said the farmer, impatiently, for he cared nothing for Carden\u0027s attempt to injure our hero.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll give it up if you\u0027ll let me go,\" said the canvas man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re not in a position to make terms,\" said Anak. \"We promise nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you won\u0027t get it,\" he returned, doggedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We won\u0027t, eh?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Anak, for he was the speaker, threw him down,177 and held his hands and feet as in a vise, while Tarbox, at his invitation, thrust his hands into the thief\u0027s pocket and drew out the gold and silver coins by handfuls.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Carden ground his teeth, but he felt that resistance was vain. He was a strong man, but Anak had the strength of three ordinary men, and he was disposed to exert his strength to the utmost on this occasion, not only because he was opposed to dishonesty, but because he had in his grasp the man who had assaulted Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you got it all, Mr. Tarbox?\" asked Anak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wait and I will count it,\" answered the farmer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Some of the money was mine,\" growled Carden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Was it? How much?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ten dollars,\" answered the canvas man, after a moment\u0027s thought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s too thin, Carden, and doesn\u0027t tally with your first story. You said you laid down on the hay in the barn because you had no money and were turned out of your boarding-house.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, you\u0027re too smart,\" muttered the baffled thief.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 178\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think we shall prove too smart for you to-night. Well, Mr. Tarbox, how about the money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s twenty-five cents short,\" said Tarbox, disturbed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, well, if you have come as near it as that you are lucky. Now let us be going.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I don\u0027t want to leave it here; some one may find it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You would be ruined if you didn\u0027t find it,\" said Anak, contemptuously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you let me up now?\" asked Carden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I will let you up, but I won\u0027t let you go.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I will lie here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you can.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Despite his resistance Anak lifted him on his shoulders and bore him off as easily as an ordinary man would carry a boy three years old.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What are you going to do with me?\" asked the canvas man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Deliver you over to the authorities,\" answered Anak; and this he did, despite the alternate prayers and menaces of his captive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My young readers will be pleased to hear that Carden passed the night in the station-house and179 was arraigned for trial the next day before the court, which was then in session.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m much obleeged to you,\" Tarbox had the grace to say as they parted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you won\u0027t have me arrested for trespass and assault, Mr. Tarbox?\" said Anak, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; you\u0027ve done me a good service to-night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Take my advice and put your money in the bank to-morrow,\" said Anak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarbox did so; not only the money which had so narrowly escaped being stolen, but his other hoards were collected and carried to the nearest savings bank, which was undoubtedly a wise act on the part of the farmer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83309.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:41 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:41 AM"}
