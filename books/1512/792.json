Go!” Tom anxiously shouted, but he immediately noticed abnormalities. The four were facing the warehouse, although they had been running away with their backs towards Adam before. How had they instead ran closer and closer? This was obviously all Adam’s mischief, and they had been taken in by his tricks at some unknown time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“What’s going on?” Tom’s heart was filled with anxiety as he couldn\u0027t think of the reasons why for a time.

His mind was blank at this critical juncture, unable to think of why this was all happening.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Damn, will I have to use that move?” Fury filled him as Tom decided to use his special killing move that he had been enhancing for very long, but had never used before. Its consumption was too great, and he would no longer have the power to protect himself for over ten days after. Just a few zombies would be enough to kill the powerless him, let alone in team Devil with its law of the jungle.

Let them decide their fate themselves. They’ll become stronger if they survive. If they can’t, well, they might as well just die.

By that time, Zheng should have killed his original, and we can go together to the laboratory then.)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eTom made his decision. As he was about to use his skill, he suddenly felt something off in his scan. A screened area was heading towards him, while the direction was where team China had arrived at just now.

Now, he was left with no choice. He couldn\u0027t flee or win now. It wasn\u0027t just about if he could escape from team China’s attack if he used his secret killing move. The main thing was that if he hadn’t escaped after using his move… death would be the best option. The vaccine would lose effectiveness in a few hours.
