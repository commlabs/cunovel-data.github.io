He checks a file resting on the table, as the room seems to grow smaller. \"Well, they were distracting.\" Palakon pauses. \"They were... unnecessary. There was the possibility of bad publicity,\" he delicately adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a concern that things might not fall into place properly,\" the Japanese man says. \"There were worries that things might not work out in New Hampshire since you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t need to go there quite yet;\" Palakon says, cutting him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" the Japanese man says. \"You\u0027re quite right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, your father didn\u0027t want you harmed in any way,\" Palakon says. \"He simply wanted you to, well, take a break for a little while. He wanted you... preoccupied. He didn\u0027t want you in the States.\" Palakon pauses. \"So he came to us. Things were discussed. Arrangements were made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence, empty and graceless. I\u0027m just staring at them, unable to take all this in because of certain details my mind cannot accept, and that lack of acceptance keeps spreading and I\u0027m looking at this through a window and it\u0027s being boarded up and it\u0027s night and no one has said or is going to say who they really are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll slide down the surface of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s what you don\u0027t know that matters most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room slopes, then rights itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are beyond uneasiness. You force yourself to look at them. You stop yourself from falling over. You try to care. But you can\u0027t. Even if you wanted to, you can\u0027t. And now, in this room, it occurs to you that they know this too. Confusion and hopelessness don\u0027t necessarily cause a person to act. Someone from my first publicist\u0027s office told me this a long time ago. Only now does it resurface. Only now does it mean anything to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you use Jamie Fields as an excuse?\" I hear myself ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We delved into your past,\" Palakon says. \"Interviews were done. There were discussions. Choices were made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did not know, however, about Jamie Fields\u0027 connection with Bobby Hughes,\" Delta says, scratching the cleft in his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a mistake,\" Palakon concedes lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We assumed she was in Europe shooting a movie,\" Delta says. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit, that\u0027s a lie,\" I moan. \"That is a f**king out-and-out lie. You knew more than that. Jesus Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward-\" Palakon starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked me to bring that hat with me and give it to Jamie Fields.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Palakon says. \"This is true. But we still had no idea she was involved with Bobby Hughes. We didn\u0027t even know of Bobby Hughes\u0027 existence until... it was too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So does Bobby Hughes know who you are?\" I ask, flashing on the videotape the director showed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Palakon says. \"Not personally. But we\u0027re fairly certain he knows of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they know you sent me? That you\u0027re the reason I\u0027m here?\" I\u0027m asking, trying to piece things together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears that way,\" Palakon says. \"We don\u0027t think Jamie Fields told him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did they find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could have been as early as when you and I first met,\" Palakon says. \"We\u0027re not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do they want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon breathes in. \"They want us to fail,\" Palakon says. \"Obviously they are trying their best to ensure that this happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fail what?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Who\u0027s they?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, who they are exactly is impossible to answer,\" Palakon says. \"Actually there are many answers. But they obviously have decided to use you-your presence-to their advantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward,\" Delta says, \"we learned at a late date that Jamie Fields has connections with a faction that works in opposition to the faction Bobby Hughes belongs to. Once we found this out we discussed the possibilities of how this could affect the outcome of the situation, of your situation. We decided that any problems arising from that connection-in relation to harming you-were remote. And if you were placed in any danger we would step in and remove you from the situation.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-200.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
