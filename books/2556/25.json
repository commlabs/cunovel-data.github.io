My head was covered along the short walk back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer I\u0027ve been left, the more uncertain I\u0027ve become again. Don\u0027t know who or what I believe anymore. I can\u0027t understand why I didn\u0027t kill Mallon when I had the chance, but at the same time I know that while I\u0027m here, he really is my best and only hope. He hasn\u0027t screwed me over so far. But if he does, now he thinks I trust him, I\u0027ll kill him before he even realizes I\u0027ve turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still chained to the bed, but now the shackles are only loosely anchored to the metal bed frame, and I\u0027m able to move around. I\u0027ve been able to move the board and look outside for the first time, but the view is disappointingly limited. All I can see from this window are the redbrick walls of other parts of this building and the gray slate roof of another section below. I can see a few other windows, and I\u0027ve been watching them, hoping to catch sight of other people like me. I haven\u0027t seen anyone else yet. It\u0027s dark now. Maybe I\u0027ll see more tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head is spinning. Still can\u0027t think straight and work this out. The lines between what I feel and what I know are blurring to the point where I can\u0027t make sense of anything anymore. I keep swinging between feeling anger and frustration that I didn\u0027t kill Mallon, then wanting him to come back again so we can talk some more. I want him to tell me what he knows about Ellis, but at the same time I know he won\u0027t have found anything out. I don\u0027t even think he has the means to find out, but I can\u0027t rule out the fact that he might. Maybe I\u0027ll just kill him when he next comes into this room and put an end to all this pointless screwing around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit back on the bed (I\u0027ve turned the mattress, but it\u0027s still damp) and look up at the ceiling, tracing the familiar patterns in the yellowed paint again. If I killed Mallon (and I know I could), what would it achieve? I still don\u0027t know where I am. For all I know I could be surrounded by hundreds of Unchanged, all of them armed to the teeth. I could be dead before Mallon\u0027s body is cold. No, as hard as it is to swallow, right now he\u0027s all I\u0027ve got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what does he really want from me? Ignoring all the bullshit, why is he doing this? He\u0027s already made it clear I don\u0027t have anything he wants, so is he still playing mind games just for the hell of it, or does he think he can house-train me like a pet? When you consider all the options, other than looking for a \"cure\" or resorting to extermination, trying to learn how to tame or control us is probably the only viable option the Unchanged think they have left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what do I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m daydreaming now, imagining walking around this place unchained, mixing freely with the Unchanged. I picture myself in a crowded room, surrounded by them but not yet killing, forcing myself to swallow down the fear and hold the Hate. I look into their faces, their stupid, evil, ignorant faces, and none of them knows who or what I am. They need their DNA tests and records and the strength of our reactions to be able to see what we are. But we, on the other hand, simply sense them. We know what they are without a word being spoken...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. The penny drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enormity of today suddenly hits me like a hammer blow. Does Mallon even realize what he\u0027s done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I resisted the temptation to kill. Regardless of the reasons why, I stayed in control and didn\u0027t fight. And if I truly can hold the Hate, then in time I could do exactly what I\u0027ve just been imagining. I could walk among the Unchanged undetected. Imagine the power and advantage that would give me... I could stand shoulder to shoulder with the enemy unseen. I could go anywhere, do anything, kill anyone...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut can I do it? Can I really chose to hold the Hate at will? Or did Mallon just catch me at my weakest ebb?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think back to that moment earlier today when I could have killed him but didn\u0027t. I wanted to do it, but I stopped myself. And it wasn\u0027t Mallon\u0027s words that stopped me... I stopped myself. I could do it again, I know I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter what I believe, whether or not I subscribe to Mallon\u0027s bullshit theories of breaking the cycle and not fighting fire with fire; the fact is he\u0027s handed control back to me, and I have to take advantage of it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-25.html","bookId":2556,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM"}
