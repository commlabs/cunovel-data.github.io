Agis\u0027s eyes sparkled as he greeted Hari Seldon. \"Hello, old friend,\" he said. \"Have you come to bring me bad luck?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I hope not,\" said Seldon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Agis unhooked the elaborate cloak he was wearing and, with a weary grunt, threw it into the corner of the room, saying, \"And you lie there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He looked at Seldon and shook his head. \"I hate that thing. It\u0027s as heavy as sin and as hot as blazes. I always have to wear it when I\u0027m being smothered under meaningless words, standing there upright like a carved image. It\u0027s just plain horrible. Cleon was born to it and he had the appearance for it. I was not and I don\u0027t. It\u0027s just my misery that I\u0027m a third cousin of his on my mother\u0027s side so that I qualified as Emperor. I\u0027d be glad to sell it for a very small sum. Would you like to be Emperor, Hari?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No no, I wouldn\u0027t dream of it, so don\u0027t get your hopes up,\" said Seldon, laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"But tell me, who is this extraordinarily beautiful young woman you have brought with you today?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Wanda flushed and the Emperor said genially, \"You mustn\u0027t let me embarrass you, my dear. One of the few perquisites an Emperor possesses is the right to say anything he chooses. No one can object or argue :bout it. They can only say, `Sire.\u0027 However, I don\u0027t want any `Sires\u0027 from you. I hate that word. Call me Agis. That is not my birth name, either. It\u0027s my Imperial name and I\u0027ve got to get used to it. So .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; tell me what\u0027s doing, Hari. What\u0027s been happening to you since the last time we met?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said briefly, \"I\u0027ve been attacked twice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The Emperor didn\u0027t seem to be sure whether this was a joke or not. He said, \"Twice? Really?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The Emperor\u0027s face darkened as Seldon told the story of the assaults. \"I suppose there wasn\u0027t a security officer around when those eight men threatened you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Not one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The Emperor rose from his chair and gestured at the other two to keep theirs. He walked back and forth, as though he were trying to work off some anger. Then he turned and faced Seldon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"For thousands of years,\" he began, \"whenever something like this happened, people would say, `Why don\u0027t we appeal to the Emperor?\u0027 or `Why doesn\u0027t the Emperor do something?\u0027 And, in the end, the Emperor can do something and does do something, even if it isn\u0027t always the intelligent thing to do. But I .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Hari, I\u0027m powerless. Absolutely powerless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Oh yes, there is the so-called Commission of Public Safety, but they seem more concerned with my safety than that of the public. It\u0027s a wonder we\u0027re having this audience at all, for you are not at all popular with the Commission.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"There\u0027s nothing I can do about anything. Do you know what\u0027s happened to the status of the Emperor since the fall of the junta and the restoration of-hah!-Imperial power?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I think I do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ll bet you don\u0027t-fully. We\u0027ve got democracy now. Do you know what democracy is?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Certainly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Agis frowned. He said, \"I\u0027ll bet you think it\u0027s a good thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I think it can be a good thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Well, there you are. It isn\u0027t. It\u0027s completely upset the Empire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Suppose I want to order more officers onto the streets of Trantor. In the old days, I would pull over a piece of paper prepared for me by the Imperial Secretary and would sign it with a flourish-and there would be more security officers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Now I can\u0027t do anything of the sort. I have to put it before the Legislature. There are seventy-five hundred men and women who instantly turn into uncounted gaggles of geese the instant a suggestion is made. In the first place, where is the funding to come from? You can\u0027t have, say, ten thousand more officers without having to pay ten thousand more salaries. Then, even if you agreed to something of the sort, who selects the new security officers? Who controls them?\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The Legislature shouts at each other, argues, thunders, and lightens, and in the end-nothing is done. Hari, I couldn\u0027t even do as small a thing as fix the broken dome lights you noticed. How much will it cost? Who\u0027s in charge? Oh, the lights will be fixed, but it can easily take a few months to do it. That\u0027s democracy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Hari Seldon said, \"As I recall, the Emperor Cleon was forever complaining that he could not do what he wished to do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The Emperor Cleon,\" said Agis impatiently, \"had two first-class First Ministers-Demerzel and yourself-and you each labored to keep Cleon from doing anything foolish. I have seventy-five hundred First Ministers, all of whom are foolish from start to finish. But surely, Hari, you haven\u0027t come to complain to me about the attacks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No, I haven\u0027t. Something much worse. Sire-Agis-I need credits.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The Emperor stared at him. \"After what I\u0027ve been telling you, Hari? I have no credits. -Oh yes, there\u0027re credits to run this establishment, of course, but in order to get them I have to face my seventy-five hundred legislators. If you think I can go to them and say, `I want credits for my friend, Hari Seldon\u0027 and if you think I\u0027ll get one quarter of what I ask for in anything less than two years, you\u0027re crazy. It won\u0027t happen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He shrugged and said, more gently, \"Don\u0027t get me wrong, Hari. I would like to help you if I could. I would particularly like to help you for the sake of your granddaughter. Looking at her makes me feel as though I should give you all the credits you would like-but it can\u0027t be done.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"Agis, if I don\u0027t get funding, psychohistory will go down the drain-after nearly forty years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s come to nothing in nearly forty years, so why worry?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Agis,\" said Seldon \"there\u0027s nothing more I can do now. The assaults on me were precisely because I\u0027m a psychohistorian. People consider me a predictor of destruction.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The Emperor nodded. \"You\u0027re bad luck, Raven Seldon. I told you this earlier.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon stood up wretchedly. \"I\u0027m through, then.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Wanda stood, too, next to Seldon the top of her head reaching her grandfather\u0027s shoulder. She gazed fixedly at the Emperor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; As Hari turned to go, the Emperor said, \"Wait. Wait.
