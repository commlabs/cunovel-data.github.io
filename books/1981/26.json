His best guess placed her delivery date sometime close to Christmas. A child would be the best gift of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last week of December,” Jamie announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always did love the winter months,” Rich said, having difficulty keeping the pride and elation from his voice. Then, damning caution, he brought her knuckles to his mouth and brushed his lips over her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth sighed softly. “Are you experiencing morning sickness, my dear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A husband should be with his wife,” Eric reminded Rich for the second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve been talking about Rich moving in with me,” Jamie said. This was news to Rich, who couldn’t recall a single word of such a conversation. After Doris Warren had unexpectedly dropped by Jamie’s apartment, they’d barely been able to resume their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got a truck,” Jason said, again motioning toward them with his pop can. “Anytime you need anything hauled, little brother, just say the word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will,” Rich muttered. He didn’t know what Jamie was up to, but he wasn’t complaining. If she wanted his family to assume this was a love match, he’d play along. From his perspective it was, so this was an unexpected turn for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s settled, then,” Eric said forcefully. “Rich is moving in with Jamie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn’t we hold a reception in their honor?” Rich’s mother asked his father. Her eyes were sparkling with excitement. Rich remembered how his mother had thrown all her efforts into the engagement party for Christy and what a disaster that had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should leave that up to these young folks, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich wasn’t keen on a reception, especially in light of the fact that Jamie planned to divorce him as soon as their baby was born. Thank heaven no one had inquired too closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich made a point of glancing at his watch. “If you’ll both excuse us, Jamie told her mother we’d be stopping by her house, as well.” She’d delivered that tidbit of information when she’d arrived at his office earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospect of facing Doris Warren twice in as many days didn’t thrill Rich. One set of parents at a time was about all he could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie didn’t know why she’d lied to Rich’s family. Normally she stuck to the truth, believing with all her being that a lie was always wrong. Yet when Rich’s father had started questioning them about their living arrangements, Jamie found herself uttering a falsehood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich had looked flabbergasted when she’d said they were moving in together. Stunned. To his credit, he recovered quickly and went along with her as though they’d actually reached that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they hadn’t discussed the prospect even once, Jamie had hoped Rich would suggest moving in with her once he learned she was pregnant. He hadn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe regretted their argument of the day before. Over and over during the long sleepless night, she’d relived their angry exchange and felt worse each time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d overreacted. Rich was only being Rich. She’d lashed out at him because he’d responded to a tense situation with humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis parting shot about her not wanting him now that she was pregnant troubled her the most. He couldn’t honestly believe that, could he? Jamie was crazy about Rich. She’d been in love with him for years, but she’d been too blind to recognize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her appointment with Dr. Fullerton, she’d gone to Rich’s office at the Boeing Renton complex. She’d hoped they’d have a few minutes alone to clear the air. But when she arrived, Rich was stone-cold and about as friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when they were at his parents’ home did he lower his guard. He’d taken her hand in his and smiled down on her as though they’d never exchanged a cross word. Of course, it could all be for show, but Jamie prayed that wasn’t the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother seems to be in better spirits this evening,” Rich said conversationally. He drove at a relaxed pace, weaving through the narrow neighborhood streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s had time to adjust to our news.” Their visit had been short and sweet. Just long enough to offer the reassurances Doris seemed to need. Jamie hadn’t found that difficult, because she was perfectly comfortable in the role of happy mother-to-be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you adjusted to the news?” Rich asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich nodded. “I suppose I should be surprised, but frankly, I’m not. By the way, are you hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little.” Jamie was famished. She’d woken with a queasy stomach that morning and skipped breakfast. Then at noon, she’d eaten a small carton of blueberry yogurt but nothing since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to go to a restaurant and get something to eat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said, thinking quickly. “We could order pizza and have it delivered to my place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her, as if the suggestion had astonished him. “Sounds good to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearly eight by the time they got to Jamie’s condominium. While Rich ordered the pizza, Jamie went into her bedroom and changed out of her business suit. She chose jeans and a pale blue sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she returned to the living room, Rich had loosened his tie and was leafing through the evening paper. He looked up when she entered the room and slowly set the newspaper aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you realize both sets of parents expect me to move in with you now.” The thought apparently weighed heavy on his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” She sat across from him, leaning forward, and clasped her hands. “Personally I …don’t think it’s such a bad idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t?” He didn’t seem to believe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean…this will probably be the only pregnancy for either of us, and since you’ve been reading so much about it, and seem so interested…it’s only fair that you share as much of the experience as possible.” Jamie hesitated a moment. “Unless, of course, you’d rather not live with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a noncommittal shrug. “I don’t mind.” His gaze moved past her to the hallway that led to the two bedrooms. “Naturally I’ll be sleeping in the spare room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Naturally,” Jamie concurred. But not for long, if everything went as she hoped. She loved Rich. Truly loved him. So far, she’d bungled their relationship and their marriage at every turn. If he were to share these short precious months with her before the birth of their child, there was a chance he might grow to love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was worth the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorth the potential heartache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorth gambling her pride and even her future for this one opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pizza arrived soon after, and they sat at the kitchen table, the cardboard box propped open in front of them. They both drank tall glasses of cold milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’ve been feeling queasy in the mornings?” Rich posed the question after several minutes of comfortable silence. He too seemed to be working to maintain this fragile peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only a little. Dr. Fullerton said it would pass soon enough. I haven’t gotten really sick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Fullerton suggested I nibble on a couple of soda crackers when I wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can bring them to you, if you like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie nodded. She would like that, but she was afraid to let Rich know how much it would mean to her. Even now, weeks later, she continued to miss their early-morning phone conversations. They’d shared a special closeness then, one that had gone from her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like a cup of coffee?” Jamie asked when they’d finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead and read the paper and I’ll get it for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a nice, wifely thing to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it is, isn’t it?” Jamie responded with a saucy smile. She took her time making the coffee. While she waited for it to brew, she cleaned the kitchen, wiped the counters and placed their few dishes in the dishwasher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrying a steaming cup of coffee into the living room, she hesitated when she saw that Rich’s eyes were closed, although the paper was still clutched in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling to herself, Jamie sat on the nerby ottoman. She took a sip of the coffee as she carefully studied the man she’d married. His features were more relaxed now, his head cocked slightly to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow handsome he was. His good looks were even more appealing in slumber. Not sure what dictated her actions, Jamie set the coffee aside and slipped the newspaper from his unsuspecting grasp. Rich stirred briefly, then nestled more securely in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie reached for the lamp, dimming it. Then, calling herself a romantic idiot, she slipped into Rich’s lap and pressed her head against his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jamie?” He sounded unsure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you hoping to find someone else in your arms?” she asked in a small whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” A smile faintly curved his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin disappeared as his hand framed her face, and his blue eyes held her captive. Jamie could feel her heart pound frantically. Then his thumb caressed the line of her jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never realized how beautiful you are,” he whispered. “All these years…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie dropped her gaze, afraid to meet his eyes. She wasn’t anywhere close to being beautiful, and it hurt, a good kind of hurt, that he should think otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth sought out hers. The kiss started slowly, gently, so gently that Jamie could feel herself begin to melt. A feeling of sublime languor filled her. It was completely unfair—downright decadent, in fact—that he could make her feel such things with a simple kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple. Rich didn’t know the meaning of the word. Certainly not when it came to kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie heard the whimpering sound before she was aware that it came from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich ended the kiss as leisurely as he’d begun it. Jamie’s eyes remained closed, and her breathing came in staggered gasps. For long, contented moments, he held her. His fingers were at the back of her head, stroking her hair. In those moments, Jamie felt the air vibrate with sweet, unspoken promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to make love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie wanted it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should be heading home?” Rich’s voice rose softly at the end of his statement, turning it into a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she whispered, catching his lower lip between her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re moving in with me, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Starting tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Starting right this minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie smiled and pressed her lips to his. “You want to argue with me?” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…it’s just…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t allow him to finish, kissing him again, cramming her heart, her soul, her love, into a single kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d surprised him; his gasp confirmed as much. He groaned anew, then deepened the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both trembling when it ended. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/marriage-of-inconvenience-those-manning-men-1/page-26.html","bookId":1981,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:58 AM"}
