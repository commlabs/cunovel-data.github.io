I thought it was a blast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m so proud of Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always knew he was talented.

And now that I\u0027ve helped theMaxwells , I\u0027m supposed to leave this town. I\u0027m not leaving anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you plan to purchase the Mansion?\" Mr. Sterling asked, still shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to use the money I raised from the auction as a down payment. And when I turn eighteen, I\u0027m going to pay off the monthly mortgage with my trust fund.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That money is for your future\" his mother said, \"Your grandmother wanted you to have it for that reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thisis my future, Mother. Grandmother wouldn\u0027t want it any other way. And neither would I. This mansion may not mean anything to you. But it means everything to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" his mom said. \"I want you to live with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Mother,\" he said, and held her hands. \"But I\u0027m almost eighteen. I could be going off to college, taking night classes. Instead, I\u0027ll be here.Painting and being with Raven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Sterling paced around the room, wiping his hair off his brow. \"This is quite a shock, you must understand. I didn\u0027t realize, Alexander, how you have grown.That you are so much like your grandmother. That you both are...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I felt a glimmer of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I saw that you were the artist behind those paintings, it was clear to me then that you\u0027d found a home here. But...\" He paused. \"There is no way you are buying the Mansion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am!\" Alexander said boldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Son, I\u0027m taking it off the market. It is rightfully yours. There is no reason you should have to pay for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, I want to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And that is the reason you shouldn\u0027t.Because you care so much about so many things. I\u0027m not allowing you to buy the house from me. We\u0027ll invest the money you earned. My mother must be watching over us right now. I know she is smiling at you-and frowning at me. I made a big mistake looking at others when it was you I should have been showcasing.My own son. Jameson, get Mr. Berkley on the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, I\u0027m sorry-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her fingers to her lips. \"You are the kind of man I always wanted you to become-you just became one a lot faster than I was ready for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to confess I haven\u0027t slept well since we decided to sell the house,\" Mr. Sterling added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson walked into the parlor..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jameson, there has been a change in plans.
