Edward was fine now - all the Cullens were fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d all reassured me; Alice reaching up to pat my head as I left, eyeing Jasper meaningfully until a flood of peace swirled around me, Esme kissing my forehead and promising me everything was all right, Emmett laughing boisterously and asking why I was the only one who was allowed to fight with werewolves. . . . Jacob\u0027s solution had them all relaxed, almost euphoric after the long weeks of stress. Doubt had been replaced with confidence. The party had ended on a note of true celebration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad enough - horrible - that the Cullens would fight for me. It was already too much that I would have to allow that. It already felt like more than I could bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Jacob, too. Not his foolish, eager brothers - most of them even younger than I was. They were just oversized, over-muscled children, and they looked forward to this like it was picnic on the beach. I could not have them in danger, too. My nerves felt frayed and exposed. I didn\u0027t know how much longer I could restrain the urge to scream out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered now, to keep my voice under control. \"You\u0027re taking me with you tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, you\u0027re worn out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I could sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"This is an experiment. I\u0027m not sure if it will be possible for us all to . . . cooperate. I don\u0027t want you in the middle of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if that didn\u0027t make me all the more anxious to go. \"If you won\u0027t take me, then I\u0027ll call Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes tightened. That was a low blow, and I knew it. But there was no way I was being left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer; we were at Charlie\u0027s house now. The front light was on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you upstairs,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tiptoed in the front door. Charlie was asleep in the living room, overflowing the too-small sofa, and snoring so loudly I could have ripped a chainsaw to life and it wouldn\u0027t have wakened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook his shoulder vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad! Charlie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grumbled, eyes still closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m home now - you\u0027re going to hurt your back sleeping like that. C\u0027mon, time to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a few more shakes, and his eyes never did open all the way, but I managed to get himoff the couch. I helped him up to his bed, where he collapsed on top of the covers, fully dressed, and started snoring again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t going to be looking for me anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward waited in my room while I washed my face and changed into jeans and a flannel shirt. He watched me unhappily from the rocking chair as I hung the outfit Alice had given me in my closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" I said, taking his hand and pulling him to my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed him down on the bed and then curled up against his chest. Maybe he was right and I was tired enough to sleep. I wasn\u0027t going to let him sneak off without me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tucked my quilt in around me, and then held me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going to work, Bella. I can feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth locked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still radiating relief. Nobody but me cared if Jacob and his friends got hurt. Not even Jacob and his friends. Especially not them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could tell I was about to lose it. \"Listen to me, Bella. This is going to be easy. The newborns will be completely taken by surprise. They\u0027ll have no more idea that werewolves even exist than you did. I\u0027ve seen how they act in a group, the way Jasper remembers. I truly believe that the wolves\u0027 hunting techniques will work flawlessly against them. And with them divided and confused, there won\u0027t be enough for the rest of us to do. Someone may have to sit out,\" he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piece of cake,\" I mumbled tonelessly against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" he stroked my cheek. \"You\u0027ll see. Don\u0027t worry now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started humming my lullaby, but, for once, it didn\u0027t calm me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople - well, vampires and werewolves really, but still - people I loved were going to get hurt. Hurt because of me. Again. I wished my bad luck would focus a little more carefully. I felt likeyelling up at the empty sky: It\u0027s me you want - over here! Just me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to think of a way that I could do exactly that - force my bad luck to focus on me. It wouldn\u0027t be easy. I would have to wait, bide my time. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not fall asleep. The minutes passed quickly, to my surprise, and I was still alert and tense when Edward pulled us both up into a sitting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to stay and sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a sour look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, and scooped me up in his arms before he jumped from my window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raced through the black, quiet forest with me on his back, and even in his run I could feel the elation. He ran the way he did when it was just us, just for enjoyment, just for the feel of the wind in his hair. It was the kind of thing that, during less anxious times, would have made me happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the big open field, his family was there, talking casually, relaxed. Emmett\u0027s booming laugh echoed through the wide space now and then. Edward set me down and we walked hand in hand toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute, because it was so dark with the moon hidden behind the clouds, but I realized that we were in the baseball clearing. It was the same place where, more than a year ago, that first lighthearted evening with the Cullens had been interrupted by James and his coven. It felt strange to be here again - as if this gathering wouldn\u0027t be complete until James and Laurent and Victoria joined us. But James and Laurent were never coming back. That pattern wouldn\u0027t be repeated. Maybe all the patterns were broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, someone had broken out of their pattern. Was it possible that the Volturi were the flexible ones in this equation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria had always seemed like a force of nature to me - like a hurricane moving toward the coast in a straight line - unavoidable, implacable, but predictable. Maybe it was wrong to limit her that way. She had to be capable of adaptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I think?\" I asked Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s all connected. Not just the two, but all three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve lost me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three bad things have happened since you came back.\" I ticked them off on my fingers. \"The newborns in Seattle. The stranger in my room. And - first of all - Victoria came to look for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed as he thought about it. \"Why do you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I agree with Jasper - the Volturi love their rules. They would probably do a better job anyway.\" And I\u0027d be dead if they wanted me dead, I added mentally. \"Remember when you were tracking Victoria last year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He frowned. \"I wasn\u0027t very good at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice said you were in Texas. Did you follow her there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows pulled together. \"Yes. Hmm . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See - she could have gotten the idea there. But she doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s doing, so the newborns are all out of control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started shaking his head. \"Only Aro knows exactly how Alice\u0027s visions work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aro would know best, but wouldn\u0027t Tanya and Irina and the rest of your friends in Denali know enough? Laurent lived with them for so long. And if he was still friendly enough with Victoria to be doing favors for her, why wouldn\u0027t he also tell her everything he knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward frowned. \"It wasn\u0027t Victoria in your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t make new friends? Think about it, Edward. If it is Victoria doing this in Seattle, she\u0027s made a lot of new friends. She\u0027s created them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered it, his forehead creased in concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" he finally said. \"It\u0027s possible. I still think the Volturi are most likely . . . But your theory - there\u0027s something there. Victoria\u0027s personality. Your theory suits her personality perfectly. She\u0027s shown a remarkable gift for self-preservation from the start - maybe it\u0027s a talent of hers. In any case, this plot would put her in no danger at all from us, if she sits safely behind and lets the newborns wreak their havoc here. And maybe little danger from the Volturi, either. Perhaps she\u0027s counting on us to win, in the end, though certainly not without heavy casualties of our own. But no survivors from her little army to bear witness against her. In fact,\" he continued, thinking it through, \"if there were survivors, I\u0027d bet she\u0027d be planning to destroy them herself. . . . Hmm. Still, she\u0027d have to have at least one friend who was a bit more mature. No fresh-made newborn left your father alive. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned into space for a long moment, and then suddenly smiled at me, coming back from his reverie. \"Definitely possible. Regardless, we\u0027ve got to be prepared for anything until we know for sure. You\u0027re very perceptive today,\" he added. \"It\u0027s impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Maybe I\u0027m just reacting to this place. It makes me feel like she\u0027s close by . . . like she sees me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw muscles tensed at the idea. \"She\u0027ll never touch you, Bella,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of his words, his eyes swept carefully across the dark trees. While he searched their shadows, the strangest expression crossed his face. His lips pulled back over his teeth and his eyes shone with an odd light - a wild, fierce kind of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet, what I wouldn\u0027t give to have her that close,\" he murmured. \"Victoria, and anyone else who\u0027s ever thought of hurting you. To have the chance to end this myself. To finish it with my own hands this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered at the ferocious longing in his voice, and clenched his fingers more tightly with mine, wishing I was strong enough to lock our hands together permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were almost to his family, and I noticed for the first time that Alice did not look as optimistic as the others. She stood a little aside, watching Jasper stretching his arms as if he were warming up to exercise, her lips pushed out in a pout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong with Alice?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward chuckled, himself again. \"The werewolves are on their way, so she can\u0027t see anything that will happen now. It makes her uncomfortable to be blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice, though the farthest from us, heard his low voice. She looked up and stuck her tongue out at him. He laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Edward,\" Emmett greeted him. \"Hey, Bella. Is he going to let you practice, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward groaned at his brother. \"Please, Emmett, don\u0027t give her any ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will our guests arrive?\" Carlisle asked Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward concentrated for a moment, and then sighed. \"A minute and a half. But I\u0027m going to have to translate. They don\u0027t trust us enough to use their human forms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle nodded. \"This is hard for them. I\u0027m grateful they\u0027re coming at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Edward, my eyes stretched wide. \"They\u0027re coming as wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, cautious of my reaction. I swallowed once, remembering the two times I\u0027d seen Jacob in his wolf form - the first time in the meadow with Laurent, the second time on the forest lane where Paul had gotten angry at me. . . . They were both memories of terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange gleam came into Edward\u0027s eyes, as though something had just occurred to him, something that was not altogether unpleasant. He turned away quickly, before I could see any more, back to Carlisle and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prepare yourselves - they\u0027ve been holding out on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Alice demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" he cautioned, and stared past her into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cullens\u0027 informal circle suddenly widened out into a loose line with Jasper and Emmett at the spear point. From the way Edward leaned forward next to me, I could tell that he wished he was standing beside them. I tightened my hand around his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted toward the forest, seeing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" Emmett muttered under his breath. \"Did you ever see anything like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme and Rosalie exchanged a wide-eyed glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I whispered as quietly as I could. \"I can\u0027t see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pack has grown,\" Edward murmured into my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn\u0027t I told him that Quil had joined the pack? I strained to see the six wolves in the gloom. Finally, something glittered in the blackness - their eyes, higher up than they should be. I\u0027d forgotten how very tall the wolves were. Like horses, only thick with muscle and fur - and teeth like knives, impossible to overlook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only see the eyes. And as I scanned, straining to see more, it occurred to me that there were more than six pairs facing us. One, two, three . . . I counted the pairs swiftly in my head. Twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were ten of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fascinating,\" Edward murmured almost silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle took a slow, deliberate step forward. It was a careful movement, designed to reassure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome,\" he greeted the invisible wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Edward responded in a strange, flat tone, and I realized at once that the words came from Sam. I looked to the eyes shining in the center of the line, the highest up, the tallest of them all. It was impossible to separate the shape of the big black wolf from the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward spoke again in the same detached voice, speaking Sam\u0027s words. \"We will watch and listen, but no more. That is the most we can ask of our self-control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is more than enough,\" Carlisle answered. \"My son Jasper\" - he gestured to where Jasper stood, tensed and ready - \"has experience in this area. He will teach us how they fight, how they are to be defeated. I\u0027m sure you can apply this to your own hunting style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are different from you?\" Edward asked for Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle nodded. \"They are all very new - only months old to this life. Children, in a way. They will have no skill or strategy, only brute strength. Tonight their numbers stand at twenty. Ten for us, ten for you - it shouldn\u0027t be difficult. The numbers may go down. The new ones fight amongst themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rumble passed down the shadowy line of wolves, a low growling mutter that somehow managed to sound enthusiastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are willing to take more than our share, if necessary,\" Edward translated, his tone less indifferent now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle smiled. \"We\u0027ll see how it plays out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know when and how they\u0027ll arrive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll come across the mountains in four days, in the late morning. As they approach, Alice will help us intercept their path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for the information. We will watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sighing sound, the eyes sank closer to the ground one set at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was silent for two heartbeats, and then Jasper took a step into the empty space between the vampires and the wolves. It wasn\u0027t hard for me to see him - his skin was as bright against the darkness as the wolves\u0027 eyes. Jasper threw a wary glance toward Edward, who nodded, and then Jasper turned his back to the werewolves. He sighed, clearly uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle\u0027s right.\" Jasper spoke only to us; he seemed to be trying to ignore the audience behind him. \"They\u0027ll fight like children. The two most important things you\u0027ll need to remember are, first, don\u0027t let them get their arms around you and, second, don\u0027t go for the obvious kill. That\u0027s all they\u0027ll be prepared for. As long as you come at them from the side and keep moving, they\u0027ll be too confused to respond effectively. Emmett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett stepped out of the line with a huge smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper backed toward the north end of the opening between the allied enemies. He waved Emmett forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Emmett first. He\u0027s the best example of a newborn attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"I\u0027ll try not to break anything,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper grinned. \"What I meant is that Emmett relies on his strength. He\u0027s very straightforward about the attack. The newborns won\u0027t be trying anything subtle, either. Just go for the easy kill, Emmett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper backed up a few more paces, his body tensing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Emmett - try to catch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I couldn\u0027t see Jasper anymore - he was a blur as Emmett charged him like a bear, grinning while he snarled. Emmett was impossibly quick, too, but not like Jasper. It looked like Jasper had no more substance than a ghost - any time it seemed Emmett\u0027s big hands had him for sure, Emmett\u0027s fingers clenched around nothing but the air. Beside me, Edward leaned forward intently, his eyes locked on the brawl. Then Emmett froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper had him from behind, his teeth an inch from his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett cussed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a muttered rumble of appreciation from the watching wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again,\" Emmett insisted, his smile gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my turn,\" Edward protested. My fingers tensed around his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a minute.\" Jasper grinned, stepping back. \"I want to show Bella something first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched with anxious eyes as he waved Alice forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you worry about her,\" he explained to me as she danced blithely into the ring. \"I want to show you why that\u0027s not necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I knew that Jasper would never allow any harm to come to Alice, it was still hard to watch as he sank back into a crouch facing her. Alice stood motionlessly, looking tiny as a doll after Emmett, smiling to herself. Jasper shifted forward, then slinked to her left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart thumped unevenly as Jasper stalked toward where Alice stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper sprang, disappearing. Suddenly he was on the other side of Alice. She didn\u0027t appear to have moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper wheeled and launched himself at her again, only to land in a crouch behind her like the first time; all the while Alice stood smiling with her eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Alice more carefully now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was moving - I\u0027d just been missing it, distracted by Jasper\u0027s attacks. She took a small step forward at the exact second that Jasper\u0027s body flew through the spot where she\u0027d just been standing. She took another step, while Jasper\u0027s grasping hands whistled past where her waist had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper closed in, and Alice began to move faster. She was dancing - spiraling and twisting and curling in on herself. Jasper was her partner, lunging, reaching through her graceful patterns, never touching her, like every movement was choreographed. Finally, Alice laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of nowhere she was perched on Jasper\u0027s back, her lips at his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotcha,\" she said, and kissed his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper chuckled, shaking his head. \"You truly are one frightening little monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves muttered again. This time the sound was wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good for them to learn some respect,\" Edward murmured, amused. Then he spoke louder. \"My turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed my hand before he let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice came to take his place beside me. \"Cool, huh?\" she asked me smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" I agreed, not looking away from Edward as he glided noiselessly toward Jasper, his movements lithe and watchful as a jungle cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got my eye on you, Bella,\" she whispered suddenly, her voice pitched so low that I could barely hear, though her lips were at my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze flickered to her face and then back to Edward. He was intent on Jasper, both of them feinting as he closed the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice\u0027s expression was full of reproach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll warn him if your plans get any more defined,\" she threatened in the same low murmur. \"It doesn\u0027t help anything for you to put yourself in danger. Do you think either of them would give up if you died? They\u0027d still fight, we all would. You can\u0027t change anything, so just be good, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced, trying to ignore her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m watching,\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had closed on Jasper now, and this fight was more even than either of the others. Jasper had the century of experience to guide him, and he tried to go on instinct alone as much as he could, but his thoughts always gave him away a fraction of a second before he acted. Edward was slightly faster, but the moves Jasper used were unfamiliar to him. They came at each other again and again, neither one able to gain the advantage, instinctive snarls erupting constantly. It was hard to watch, but harder to look away. They moved too fast for me to really understand what they were doing. Now and then the sharp eyes of the wolves would catch my attention. I had a feeling the wolves were getting more out of this than I was - maybe more than they should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Carlisle cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper laughed, and took a step back. Edward straightened up and grinned at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to work,\" Jasper consented. \"We\u0027ll call it a draw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone took turns, Carlisle, then Rosalie, Esme, and Emmett again. I squinted through my lashes, cringing as Jasper attacked Esme. That one was the hardest to watch. Then he slowed down, still not quite enough for me to understand his motions, and gave more instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see what I\u0027m doing here?\" he would ask. \"Yes, just like that,\" he encouraged. \"Concentrate on the sides. Don\u0027t forget where their target will be. Keep moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was always focused, watching and also listening to what others couldn\u0027t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got more difficult to follow as my eyes got heavier. I hadn\u0027t been sleeping well lately, anyway, and it was approaching a solid twenty-four hours since the last time I\u0027d slept. I leaned against Edward\u0027s side, and let my eyelids droop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re about finished,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper confirmed that, turning toward the wolves for the first time, his expression uncomfortable again. \"We\u0027ll be doing this tomorrow. Please feel welcome to observe again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Edward answered in Sam\u0027s cool voice. \"We\u0027ll be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Edward sighed, patted my arm, and stepped away from me. He turned to his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pack thinks it would be helpful to be familiar with each of our scents - so they don\u0027t make mistakes later. If we could hold very still, it will make it easier for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly,\" Carlisle said to Sam. \"Whatever you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gloomy, throaty grumble from the wolf pack as they all rose to their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were wide again, exhaustion forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deep black of the night was just beginning to fade - the sun brightening the clouds, though it hadn\u0027t cleared the horizon yet, far away on the other side of the mountains. As they approached, it was suddenly possible to make out shapes . . . colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was in the lead, of course. Unbelievably huge, black as midnight, a monster straight out of my nightmares - literally; after the first time I\u0027d seen Sam and the others in the meadow, they\u0027d starred in my bad dreams more than once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I could see them all, match the vastness with each pair of eyes, it looked like more than ten. The pack was overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye, I saw that Edward was watching me, carefully evaluating my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam approached Carlisle where he stood in the front, the huge pack right on his tail. Jasper stiffened, but Emmett, on the other side of Carlisle, was grinning and relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam sniffed at Carlisle, seeming to wince slightly as he did. Then he moved on to Jasper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes ran down the wary brace of wolves. I was sure I could pick out a few of the new additions. There was a light gray wolf that was much smaller than the others, the hackles on the back of his neck raised in distaste. There was another, the color of desert sand, who seemed gangly and uncoordinated beside the rest. A low whine broke through the sandy wolf\u0027s control when Sam\u0027s advance left him isolated between Carlisle and Jasper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped at the wolf just behind Sam. His fur was reddish-brown and longer than the others, shaggy in comparison. He was almost as tall as Sam, the second largest in the group. His stance was casual, somehow exuding nonchalance over what the rest obviously considered an ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enormous russet-colored wolf seemed to feel my gaze, and he looked up at me with familiar black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared back at him, trying to believe what I already knew. I could feel the wonder and fascination on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf\u0027s muzzle fell open, pulling back over his teeth. It would have been a frightening expression, except that his tongue lolled out the side in a wolfy grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s grin widened over his sharp teeth. He left his place in line, ignoring the eyes of his pack as they followed him. He trotted past Edward and Alice to stand not two feet away from me. He stopped there, his gaze flickering briefly toward Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stood motionless, a statue, his eyes still assessing my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob crouched down on his front legs and dropped his head so that his face was no higher than mine, staring at me, measuring my response just as much as Edward was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob?\" I breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answering rumble deep in his chest sounded like a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached my hand out, my fingers trembling slightly, and touched the red-brown fur on the side of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black eyes closed, and Jacob leaned his huge head into my hand. A thrumming hum resonated in this throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fur was both soft and rough, and warm against my skin. I ran my fingers through it curiously, learning the texture, stroking his neck where the color deepened. I hadn\u0027t realized how close I\u0027d gotten; without warning, Jacob suddenly licked my face from chin to hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ew! Gross, Jake!\" I complained, jumping back and smacking at him, just as I would have if he were human. He dodged out of the way, and the coughing bark that came through his teeth was obviously laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my face on the sleeve of my shirt, unable to keep from laughing with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that point that I realized that everyone was watching us, the Cullens and the werewolves - the Cullens with perplexed and somewhat disgusted expressions. It was hard to read the wolves\u0027 faces. I thought Sam looked unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Edward, on edge and clearly disappointed. I realized he\u0027d been hoping for a different reaction from me. Like screaming and running away in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob made the laughing sound again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other wolves were backing away now, not taking their eyes off the Cullens as they departed. Jacob stood by my side, watching them go. Soon, they disappeared into the murky forest. Only two hesitated by the trees, watching Jacob, their postures radiating anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed, and - ignoring Jacob - came to stand on my other side, taking my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready to go?\" he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could answer, he was staring over me at Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve not quite figured out all the details yet,\" he said, answering a question in Jacob\u0027s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jacob-wolf grumbled sullenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more complicated than that,\" Edward said. \"Don\u0027t concern yourself; I\u0027ll make sure it\u0027s safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just discussing strategy,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s head swiveled back and forth, looking at our faces. Then, suddenly, he bolted for the forest. As he darted away, I noticed for the first time a square of folded black fabric secured to his back leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I called, one hand stretching out automatically to reach after him. But he disappeared into the trees in seconds, the other two wolves following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did he leave?\" I asked, hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s coming back,\" Edward said. He sighed. \"He wants to be able to talk for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the edge of the forest where Jacob had vanished, leaning into Edward\u0027s side again. I was on the point of collapse, but I was fighting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob loped back into view, on two legs this time. His broad chest was bare, his hair tangled and shaggy. He wore only a pair of black sweat pants, his feet bare to the cold ground. He was alone now, but I suspected that his friends lingered in the trees, invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take him long to cross the field, though he gave a wide berth to the Cullens, who stood talking quietly in a loose circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, bloodsucker,\" Jacob said when he was a few feet from us, evidently continuing the conversation I\u0027d missed. \"What\u0027s so complicated about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to consider every possibility,\" Edward said, unruffled. \"What if someone gets by you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob snorted at that idea. \"Okay, so leave her on the reservation. We\u0027re making Collin and Brady stay behind anyway. She\u0027ll be safe there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled. \"Are you talking about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to know what he plans to do with you during the fight,\" Jacob explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t stay in Forks, Bella.\" Edward\u0027s voice was pacifying. \"They know where to look for you there. What if someone slipped by us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach dropped and the blood drained from my face. \"Charlie?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be with Billy,\" Jacob assured me quickly. \"If my dad has to commit a murder to get him there, he\u0027ll do it. Probably it won\u0027t take that much. It\u0027s this Saturday, right? There\u0027s a game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Saturday?\" I asked, my head spinning. I was too lightheaded to control my wildly random thoughts. I frowned at Edward. \"Well, crap! There goes your graduation present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward laughed. \"It\u0027s the thought that counts,\" he reminded me. \"You can give the tickets to someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspiration came swiftly. \"Angela and Ben,\" I decided at once. \"At least that will get them out of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my cheek. \"You can\u0027t evacuate everyone,\" he said in a gentle voice. \"Hiding you is just a precaution. I told you - we\u0027ll have no problem now. There won\u0027t be enough of them to keep us entertained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about keeping her in La Push?\" Jacob interjected, impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been back and forth too much,\" Edward said. \"She\u0027s left trails all over the place. Alice only sees very young vampires coming on the hunt, but obviously someone created them. There is someone more experienced behind this. Whoever he\" - Edward paused to look at me - \"or she is, this could all be a distraction. Alice will see if he decides to look himself, but we could be very busy at the time that decision is made. Maybe someone is counting on that. I can\u0027t leave her somewhere she\u0027s been frequently. She has to be hard to find, just in case. It\u0027s a very long shot, but I\u0027m not taking chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Edward as he explained, my forehead creasing. He patted my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just being overcautious,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob gestured to the deep forest east of us, to the vast expanse of the Olympic Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So hide her here,\" he suggested. \"There\u0027s a million possibilities - places either one of us could be in just a few minutes if there\u0027s a need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shook his head. \"Her scent is too strong and, combined with mine, especially distinct. Even if I carried her, it would leave a trail. Our trace is all over the range, but in conjunction with Bella\u0027s scent, it would catch their attention. We\u0027re not sure exactly which path they\u0027ll take, because they don\u0027t know yet. If they crossed her scent before they found us . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them grimaced at the same time, their eyebrows pulling together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see the difficulties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There has to be a way to make it work,\" Jacob muttered. He glared toward the forest, pursing his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swayed on my feet. Edward put his arm around my waist, pulling me closer and supporting my weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get you home - you\u0027re exhausted. And Charlie will be waking up soon. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a sec,\" Jacob said, wheeling back to us, his eyes bright. \"My scent disgusts you, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm, not bad.\" Edward was two steps ahead. \"It\u0027s possible.\" He turned toward his family. \"Jasper?\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper looked up curiously. He walked over with Alice a half step behind. Her face was frustrated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Jacob.\" Edward nodded at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob turned toward me with a strange mixture of emotion on his face. He was clearly excited by whatever this new plan of his was, but he was also still uneasy so close to his enemy allies. And then it was my turn to be wary as he held his arms out toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to see if I can confuse the scent enough to hide your trail,\" Jacob explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at his open arms suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to let him carry you, Bella,\" Edward told me. His voice was calm, but I could hear the subdued distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob rolled his eyes, impatient, and reached down to yank me up into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be such a baby,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his eyes flickered to Edward, just like mine did. Edward\u0027s face was composed and smooth. He spoke to Jasper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella\u0027s scent is so much more potent to me - I thought it would be a fairer test if someone else tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob turned away from them and paced swiftly into the woods. I didn\u0027t say anything as the dark closed around us. I was pouting, uncomfortable in Jacob\u0027s arms. It felt too intimate to me - surely he didn\u0027t need to hold me quite so tightly - and I couldn\u0027t help but wonder what it felt like to him. It reminded me of my last afternoon in La Push, and I didn\u0027t want to think about that. I folded my arms, annoyed when the brace on my hand intensified the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t go far; he made a wide arc and came back into the clearing from a different direction, maybe half a football field away from our original departure point. Edward was there alone and Jacob headed toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can put me down now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to take a chance of messing up the experiment.\" His walk slowed and his arms tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so annoying,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of nowhere, Jasper and Alice stood beside Edward. Jacob took one more step, and then set me down a half dozen feet from Edward. Without looking back at Jacob, I walked to Edward\u0027s side and took his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you don\u0027t touch anything, Bella, I can\u0027t imagine someone sticking their nose close enough to that trail to catch your scent,\" Jasper said, grimacing. \"It was almost completely obscured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A definite success,\" Alice agreed, wrinkling her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it gave me an idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which will work,\" Alice added confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clever,\" Edward agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you stand that?\" Jacob muttered to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward ignored Jacob and looked at me while he explained. \"We\u0027re - well, you\u0027re - going to leave a false trail to the clearing, Bella. The newborns are hunting, your scent will excite them, and they\u0027ll come exactly the way we want them to without being careful about it. Alice can already see that this will work. When they catch our scent, they\u0027ll split up and try to come at us from two sides. Half will go through the forest, where her vision suddenly disappears. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Jacob hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward smiled at him, a smile of true comradeship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick. How could they be so eager for this? How could I stand having both of them in danger? I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance,\" Edward said suddenly, his voice disgusted. It made me jump, worrying that he\u0027d somehow heard my resolve, but his eyes were on Jasper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" Jasper said quickly. \"I didn\u0027t even consider it, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice stepped on his foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Bella was actually there in the clearing,\" Jasper explained to her, \"it would drive them insane. They wouldn\u0027t be able to concentrate on anything but her. It would make picking them off truly easy. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s glare had Jasper backtracking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s too dangerous for her. It was just an errant thought,\" he said quickly. But he looked at me from the corner of his eyes, and the look was wistful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Edward said. His voice rang with finality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" Jasper said. He took Alice\u0027s hand and started back to the others. \"Best two out of three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him ask her as they went to practice again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob stared after him in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jasper looks at things from a military perspective,\" Edward quietly defended his brother. \"He looks at all the options - it\u0027s thoroughness, not callousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d edged closer unconsciously, drawn by his absorption in the planning. He stood only three feet from Edward now, and, standing there between them, I could feel the physical tension in the air. It was like static, an uncomfortable charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward got back to business. \"I\u0027ll bring her here Friday afternoon to lay the false trail. You can meet us afterward, and carry her to a place I know. Completely out of the way, and easily defensible, not that it will come to that. I\u0027ll take another route there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what? Leave her with a cell phone?\" Jacob asked critically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a better idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was suddenly smug. \"Actually, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. . . . Again, dog, not bad at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob turned to me quickly, as if determined to play the good guy by keeping me in the conversation. \"We tried to talk Seth into staying behind with the younger two. He\u0027s still too young, but he\u0027s stubborn and he\u0027s resisting. So I thought of a new assignment for him - cell phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to look like I got it. No one was fooled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as Seth Clearwater is in his wolf form, he\u0027ll be connected to the pack,\" Edward said. \"Distance isn\u0027t a problem?\" he added, turning to Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three hundred miles?\" Edward asked. \"That\u0027s impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was the good guy again. \"That\u0027s the farthest we\u0027ve ever gone to experiment,\" he told me. \"Still clear as a bell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded absently; I was reeling from the idea that little Seth Clearwater was already a werewolf, too, and that made it difficult to concentrate. I could see his bright smile, so much like a younger Jacob, in my head; he couldn\u0027t be more than fifteen, if he was that. His enthusiasm at the council meeting bonfire suddenly took on new meaning. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good idea.\" Edward seemed reluctant to admit this. \"I\u0027ll feel better with Seth there, even without the instantaneous communication. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d be able to leave Bella there alone. To think it\u0027s come to this, though! Trusting werewolves!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fightingwith vampires instead of against them!\" Jacob mirrored Edward\u0027s tone of disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you still get to fight against some of them,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob smiled. \"That\u0027s the reason we\u0027re here.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-19.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
