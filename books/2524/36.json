When ready, he would come for her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m familiar with all the devils in all the hells, Genevieve,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027This is just a matter of invoking the correct demonic personage.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not know what he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her into one of the narrow, unpleasant-smelling streets that constituted the worst slum in London. Walls leaned together, dropping the occasional brick to the cobbles. Evil-looking new-borns congregated at every corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Charles,\u0027 she said. \u0027This is the Old Jago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allowed that it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered if he had gone mad. Dressed as they were\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which was to say, not in rags\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they were practically parading with a sandwich board marked \u0027ROB AND KILL ME\u0027. Red eyes glittered behind broken windows. Rat-whiskered children sat on doorsteps, waiting to fight for the leavings of larger predators. The further they penetrated into the rookery, the thicker the gathering crowds were. She was reminded of vultures. This was not England, this was a jungle. Places, she told herself, were not evil: they were what people made of them. In the dark, something laughed and Genevieve jumped. Charles calmed her and looked about, leaning on his cane as if taking the air at Hampton Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunched, shambling creatures lurked in courtyards. Hate came off them in waves. The Jago was where the worst cases ended up, new-borns shape-shifted beyond any resemblance to humanity, criminals so vile other criminals would not tolerate their society. A Christian Crusade flag, the cross dyed in what probably was not blood, hung from one window. John Jago\u0027s mission was hereabouts, where few policemen dared venture. No one knew the clergyman\u0027s real name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do we seek?\u0027 Genevieve asked, under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A Chinaman.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart sank again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 he reassured, \u0027not that Chinaman. In this district, I imagine any Chinaman will serve.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burly new-born, bare-chested under his braces, detached himself from the shadows of a wall and stood before them, looking down on Charles. He smiled, showing yellow fangs. His arms were tattooed with skulls and bats. Having seen Charles save the day with Liz Stride, Genevieve thought he could best the vampire with silver blade or bullet. But he would not last long if a dozen of the rough\u0027s friends joined in. At least a dozen were scattered about, picking their teeth with grimy thumbnails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I say,\u0027 Charles began, drawling like a Mayfair ass, \u0027direct me to the nearest opium den, there\u0027s a good fellow. The viler, the better, if you catch my drift.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething shone in Charles\u0027s hand. A coin. It disappeared into the rough\u0027s fist, and then his mouth. He bit the shilling in two and spat the halves out. They hardly had time to clatter before a tangle of children were fighting over them. The rough looked into Charles\u0027s face, trying to exert his new-won vampire powers of fascination. After a minute or two, during which Genevieve was increasingly uncomfortable, he grunted and turned away. Charles had passed a test. The rough nodded towards an archway and slouched off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arch led to an enclosed square, and was covered with a greasy grey blanket on a string. The makeshift curtain was swept aside by a slender hand and a cloud of scented smoke drifted out. The glow-worms of opium pipes lit up wizened faces. A warm sailor, with scabs on his neck and nothing in his eyes, tottered out, his pay burned away in dream-smoke. He would be lucky to get out of the Jago with his sea-boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just the thing,\u0027 Charles said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are we doing?\u0027 she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Rattling a web to attract a spider\u0027s attention.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wonderful.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young Chinese, new-born and delicate, emerged from the courtyard. The roughs all deferred to her, which said much. She wore blue pyjamas and trod upon filthy cobbles with silk slippers. Her skin shone like fine porcelain. A tightly-bound rope of glossy black hair hung to her knees. Charles bowed to her, and she responded, arms outspread in welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Charles Beauregard of the Diogenes Club sends his regards to your master, the Lord of Strange Deaths.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl said nothing. Genevieve imagined some of the loiterers had slipped away and found something else to interest them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wish it known that this woman, Genevieve Dieudonne, is under my protection. I request that no further action be taken against her lest the bond of friendship between your master and myself be broken.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl considered a moment and gave one sharp nod. She bowed once more and retreated behind the curtain. Through the thin blanket, Genevieve still saw the wavering red dots of the pipes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That should do it, I think,\u0027 Charles said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve shook her head. She did not quite understand what had passed between Charles and the oriental new-born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have friends in strange places,\u0027 he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were alone. Even the children had disappeared. By invoking this \u0027Lord of Strange Deaths\u0027, Charles had cleared the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So Charles, I am under your protection?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked almost amused. \u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not know what to think. Somehow she did feel safer, but also a touch irritated. \u0027I suppose I should thank you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It might be an idea.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \u0027So that was it, then? No battle of titanic forces, no magic destruction of the enemy, no heroic last stand?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just a little diplomacy. Always the best way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And your \"friend\" can really call off the elder, as a huntsman calls a dog to heel?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Indubitably.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were walking out of the Jago, back towards the safer\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;safer!?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;waters of Whitechapel. The slum was lit only by braziers of infernal embers in the courtyards, which gave the dark a reddish underglow. Now there were at least the usual hissing streetlights. By comparison, the fog here was almost friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Chinese believe that if you save a person from death, you\u0027re responsible for the rest of their lives. Charles, are you prepared to take that burden? I\u0027ve lived a long time and intend to live a great while longer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Genevieve, I think you unlikely to place too great a strain on my conscience.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped and she looked at him. He was barely able to conceal his smug amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You only know me as I am now,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m not the person I was, or the one I will be. Over the years, we don\u0027t change on the outside but inside... that\u0027s another thing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll undertake the risk.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith morning only an hour or so away, she was tired. She was still weak and should not have ventured out. The ache in her neck was worse than it had been. Amworth said that meant she was healing properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have heard the expression before,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The expression?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\"Lord of Strange Deaths\". One who goes by that title is mentioned, if very infrequently, in connection with a criminal tong. His reputation is not of the best.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As I said, he is a devil from hell. But he is a devil of his word; he takes obligations seriously.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He has an obligation to you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Indeed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then you\u0027ve an obligation to him?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles said nothing. His mind was also a blank, except for a railway station sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re doing that deliberately, are you not?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thinking of Basingstoke.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles laughed. And, after a moment, she did too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-36.html","bookId":2524,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:17 PM"}
