It was only when I\u0027d been completely silent for a good half hour that he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still awake in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I was too much in the habit of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to come out here and stretch?\" he offered. \"My back is aching just thinking about that stupid hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIronically, considering my week of maddening silence, I wasn\u0027t in the mood for company. But his offer wasn\u0027t one I could refuse. Before I could think about it, my hands were pulling me through the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb was sitting with crossed legs on the mat. I watched him for some reaction as I shook out my arms and legs and rolled my shoulders, but he had his eyes closed. Like the time of Jamie\u0027s visit, he looked asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long had it been since I\u0027d seen Jamie? And how was he now? My already sore heart gave a painful little lurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feel better?\" Jeb asked, his eyes opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be okay, you know.\" He grinned a wide, face-stretching grin. \"That stuff I said to Jared... Well, I won\u0027t say I lied, exactly, because it\u0027s all true if you look at it from a certain angle, but from another angle, it wasn\u0027t so much the truth as it was what he needed to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just stared; I didn\u0027t understand a word of what he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, Jared needs a break from this. Not from you, kid,\" he added quickly, \"but from the situation. He\u0027ll gain some perspective while he\u0027s away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how he seemed to know exactly which words and phrases would cut at me. And, more than that, why should Jeb care if his words hurt me, or even if my back was aching and throbbing? His kindness toward me was frightening in its own way because it was incomprehensible. At least Jared\u0027s actions made sense. Kyle\u0027s and Ian\u0027s murder attempts, the doctor\u0027s cheerful eagerness to hurt me-these behaviors also were logical. Not kindness. What did Jeb want from me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so glum,\" Jeb urged. \"There\u0027s a bright side to this. Jared was being real pigheaded about you, and now that he\u0027s temporarily out of the picture, it\u0027s bound to make things more comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrows furrowed as I tried to decide what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For example,\" he went on. \"This space here we usually use for storage. Now, when Jared and the guys get back, we\u0027re going to need someplace to put all the stuff they bring home with them. So we might as well find a new place for you now. Something a little bigger, maybe? Something with a bed?\" He smiled again as he dangled the carrot in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for him to snatch it away, to tell me he was joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, his eyes-the color of faded blue jeans-became very, very gentle. Something about the expression in them brought the lump back to my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to go back in that hole, honey. The worst part\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found that I couldn\u0027t doubt the earnest look on his face. For the second time in an hour, I put my face in my hands and cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got to his feet and patted me awkwardly on the shoulder. He didn\u0027t seem comfortable with tears. \"There, there,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got control of myself more quickly this time. When I wiped the wet from my eyes and smiled tentatively at him, he nodded in approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a girl,\" he said, patting me again. \"Now, we\u0027ll have to hang out here until we\u0027re sure Jared\u0027s really gone and can\u0027t catch us.\" He grinned conspiratorially. \"Then we\u0027ll have some fun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered that his idea of fun was usually along the lines of an armed standoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled at my expression. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. While we\u0027re waiting, you might as well try to get some rest. I\u0027ll bet even that skinny mattress would feel pretty good to you right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked from his face to the mat on the floor and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" he said. \"You look like you could use a good sleep. I\u0027ll keep watch over you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouched, new moisture in my eyes, I sank down on the mat and laid my head on the pillow. It was heavenly, despite Jeb\u0027s calling it thin. I stretched out to my full height, pointing my toes and reaching out with my fingers. I heard my joints popping. Then I let myself wilt into the mattress. It felt as if it were hugging me, erasing all the sore spots. I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does me good to see that,\" Jeb muttered. \"It\u0027s like an itch you can\u0027t scratch, knowing someone is suffering under your own roof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased himself to the floor a few yards away and started humming quietly. I was asleep before he\u0027d finished the first bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke up, I knew that I\u0027d been solidly asleep for a long time-a longer stretch than I\u0027d slept since coming here. No pains, no frightening interruptions. I would have felt pretty good, except that waking on the pillow reminded me that Jared was gone. It still smelled like him. And in a good way, not the way I smelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to just dreams. Melanie sighed forlornly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered my dream only vaguely, but I knew it had featured Jared, as was usual when I was able to sleep deeply enough to dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, kid,\" Jeb said, sounding chipper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeled back my lids to look at him. Had he sat against the wall all night? He didn\u0027t look tired, but I suddenly felt guilty for monopolizing the better accommodations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the guys are long gone,\" he said enthusiastically. \"How \u0027bout a tour?\" He stroked the gun slung through a strap at his waist with an unconscious gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes opened wider, stared at him in disbelief. A tour?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, don\u0027t turn sissy on me. Nobody\u0027s going to bother you. And you\u0027ll need to be able to find your way around eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out a hand to help me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took it automatically, my head spinning as I tried to process what he was saying. I would need to find my way around? Why? And what did he mean \"eventually\"? How long did he expect me to last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me to my feet and led me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten what it was like to move through the dark tunnels with a hand guiding me. It was so easy-walking barely took any concentration at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see,\" Jeb murmured. \"Maybe the right wing first. Set up a decent place for you. Then the kitchens...\" He went on planning his tour, continuing as we stepped through the narrow crevice into the bright tunnel that led to the even brighter big room. When the sound of voices reached us, I felt my mouth go dry. Jeb kept right on chatting at me, either missing or ignoring my terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet the carrots are sprouted today,\" he was saying as he led me into the main plaza. The light blinded me, and I couldn\u0027t see who was there, but I could feel their eyes on me. The sudden silence was as ominous as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" Jeb answered himself. \"Now, I always think that looks real pretty. A nice spring green like that is a treat to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and held his hand out, inviting me to look. I squinted in the direction he gestured, but my eyes kept darting around the room as I waited for them to adjust. It took a moment, but then I saw what he was talking about. I also saw that there were maybe fifteen people here today, all of them regarding me with hostile eyes. But they were busy with something else, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wide, dark square that took up the center of the big cavern was no longer dark. Half of it was fuzzy with spring green, just as Jeb had said. It was pretty. And amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder no one stood on this space. It was a garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carrots?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered at normal volume. \"This half that\u0027s greening up. The other half is spinach. Should be up in a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people in the room had gone back to work, still peeking at me now and then but mostly concentrating on what they were doing. It was easy enough to understand their actions-and the big barrel on wheels, and the hoses-now that I recognized the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irrigating?\" I whispered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Dries out pretty quick in this heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded in agreement. It was still early, I guessed, but I was already sweaty. The heat from the intense radiance overhead was stifling in the caves. I tried to examine the ceiling again, but it was too bright to stare at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged Jeb\u0027s sleeve and squinted up at the dazzling light. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb smiled, seeming thrilled with my curiosity. \"Same way the magicians do it-with mirrors, kid. Hundreds of \u0027em. Took me long enough to get them all up there. It\u0027s nice to have extra hands around here when they need cleaning. See, there\u0027s only four small vents in the ceiling here, and that wasn\u0027t enough light for what I had in mind. What do you think of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his shoulders back, proud again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brilliant,\" I whispered. \"Astonishing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb grinned and nodded, enjoying my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s keep on,\" he suggested. \"Got a lot to do today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led me to a new tunnel, a wide, naturally shaped tube that ran off from the big cave. This was new territory. My muscles all locked up; I moved forward with stiff legs, unbending knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb patted my hand but otherwise ignored my nerves. \"This is mostly sleeping quarters and some storage. The tubes are closer to the surface here, so it was easier to get some light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed up at a bright, slender crack in the tunnel ceiling overhead. It threw a hand-sized spot of white onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached a broad fork-not really a fork, because there were too many tines. It was an octopus-like branching of passageways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Third from the left,\" he said, and looked at me expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Third from the left?\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Don\u0027t forget. It\u0027s easy to get lost around here, and that wouldn\u0027t be safe for you. Folks\u0027d just as soon stab you as send you in the right direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. \"Thanks,\" I muttered with quiet sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed as if my answer had delighted him. \"No point in ignoring the truth. Doesn\u0027t make it worse to have it said out loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t make it better, either, but I didn\u0027t say that. I was beginning to enjoy myself just a little. It was so nice to have someone talk to me again. Jeb was, if nothing else, interesting company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, two, three,\" he counted off, then he led me down the third hallway from the left. We started passing round entrances covered by a variety of makeshift doors. Some were curtained off with patterned sheets of fabric; others had big pieces of cardboard duct-taped together. One hole had two real doors-one red-painted wood, one gray metal-leaning over the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven,\" Jeb counted, and stopped in front of a smallish circle, the tallest point just a few inches higher than my head. This one protected its privacy with a pretty jade green screen-the kind that might divide the space in an elegant living room. There was a pattern of cherry blossoms embroidered across the silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the only space I can think of for now. The only one that\u0027s fitted up decent for human habitation. It will be empty for a few weeks, and we\u0027ll figure something better out for you by the time it\u0027s needed again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folded the screen aside, and a light that was brighter than that in the hallway greeted us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room he revealed gave me a strange feeling of vertigo-probably because it was so much taller than it was wide. Standing inside it was like standing in a tower or a silo, not that I had ever been in such places, but those were the comparisons Melanie made. The ceiling, twice as high as the room was wide, was a maze of cracks. Like vines of light, the cracks circled around and almost met. This seemed dangerous to me-unstable. But Jeb showed no fear of cave-ins as he led me farther in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a double-sized mattress on the floor, with about a yard of space on three sides of it. The two pillows and two blankets twisted into two separate configurations on either half of the mattress made it look as if this room housed a couple. A thick wooden pole-something like a rake handle-was braced horizontally against the far wall at shoulder height with the ends lodged in two of the Swiss cheese holes in the rock. Over it were draped a handful of T-shirts and two pairs of jeans. A wooden stool was flush with the wall beside the makeshift clothes rack, and on the floor beneath it was a stack of worn paperback books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" I said to Jeb, whispering again. This space so obviously belonged to someone that I no longer felt like we were alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one of the guys out on the raid. Won\u0027t be back for a while. We\u0027ll find you something by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like it-not the room, but the idea of staying in it. The presence of the owner was strong despite the simple belongings. No matter who he was, he would not be happy to have me here. He would hate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb seemed to read my mind-or maybe the expression on my face was clear enough that he didn\u0027t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, now,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t worry about that. This is my house, and this is just one of my many guest rooms. I say who is and isn\u0027t my guest. Right now, you are my guest, and I am offering you this room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still didn\u0027t like it, but I wasn\u0027t going to upset Jeb, either. I vowed that I would disturb nothing, if it meant sleeping on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s keep moving. Don\u0027t forget: third from the left, seventh in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Green screen,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb took me back through the big garden room, around the perimeter to the opposite side, and through the biggest tunnel exit. When we passed the irrigators, they stiffened and turned, afraid to have me behind their backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tunnel was well lit, the bright crevices coming at intervals too regular to be natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We go even closer to the surface now. It gets drier, but it gets hotter, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed that almost immediately. Instead of being steamed, we were now being baked. The air was less stuffy and stale. I could taste the desert dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more voices ahead. I tried to steel myself against the inevitable reaction. If Jeb insisted on treating me like... like a human, like a welcome guest, I was going to have to get used to this. No reason to let it make me nauseous over and over again. My stomach began an unhappy rolling anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way\u0027s the kitchen,\" Jeb told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought we were in another tunnel, one crowded with people. I pressed myself against the wall, trying to keep my distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen was a long corridor with a high ceiling, higher than it was wide, like my new quarters. The light was bright and hot. Instead of thin crevices through deep rock, this place had huge open holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t cook in the daytime, of course. Smoke, you know. So we mainly use this as the mess hall until nightfall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll conversation had come to an abrupt halt, so Jeb\u0027s words were clear for everyone to hear. I tried to hide behind him, but he kept walking farther in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d interrupted breakfast, or maybe it was lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humans-almost twenty at a quick estimate-were very close here. It wasn\u0027t like the big cavern. I wanted to keep my eyes on the floor, but I couldn\u0027t stop them from flashing around the room. Just in case. I could feel my body tensing to run for it, though where I would run, I didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst both sides of the hallway, there were long piles of rock. Mostly rough, purple volcanic stone, with some lighter-colored substance-cement?-running between them, creating seams, holding them together. On top of these piles were different stones, browner in color, and flat. They were glued together with the light gray grout as well. The final product was a relatively even surface, like a counter or a table. It was clear that they were used for both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humans sat on some, leaned on others. I recognized the bread rolls they held suspended between the table and their mouths, frozen with disbelief as they took in Jeb and his one-person tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them were familiar. Sharon, Maggie, and the doctor were the closest group to me. Melanie\u0027s cousin and aunt glared at Jeb furiously-I had an odd conviction that I could have stood on my head and bellowed songs out of Melanie\u0027s memory at the top of my lungs and they still would not have looked at me-but the doctor eyed me with a frank and almost friendly curiosity that made me feel cold deep inside my bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the back end of the hall-shaped room, I recognized the tall man with ink black hair and my heart stuttered. I\u0027d thought Jared was supposed to take the hostile brothers with him to make Jeb\u0027s job of keeping me alive slightly easier. At least it was the younger one, Ian, who had belatedly developed a conscience-not quite as bad as leaving Kyle behind. That consolation did not slow my racing pulse, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody full so quick?\" Jeb asked loudly and sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lost our appetites,\" Maggie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How \u0027bout you,\" he said, turning to me. \"You hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quiet groan went through our audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head-a small but frantic motion. I didn\u0027t even know whether I was hungry, but I knew I couldn\u0027t eat in front of this crowd that would gladly have eaten me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I am,\" Jeb grumbled. He walked down the aisle between the counters, but I did not follow. I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of being within easy reach of the rest. I stayed pressed against the wall where I stood. Only Sharon and Maggie watched him go to a big plastic bin on one counter and grab a roll. Everyone else watched me. I was certain that if I moved an inch, they would pounce. I tried not to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s just keep on movin\u0027,\" Jeb suggested around a mouthful of bread as he ambled back to me. \"Nobody seems able to concentrate on their lunch. Easily distracted, this set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was watching the humans for sudden movements, not really seeing their faces after that first moment when I recognized the few I could put names to. So it wasn\u0027t until Jamie stood up that I noticed him there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a head shorter than the adults beside him, but taller than the two smaller children who perched on the counter on his other side. He hopped lightly off his seat and followed behind Jeb. His expression was tight, compressed, like he was trying to solve a difficult equation in his head. He examined me through narrow eyes as he approached on Jeb\u0027s heels. Now I wasn\u0027t the only one in the room holding my breath. The others\u0027 gazes shifted back and forth between Melanie\u0027s brother and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Jamie, Melanie thought. She hated the sad, adult expression on his face, and I probably hated it even more. She didn\u0027t feel as guilty as I did for putting it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only we could take it away. She sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s too late. What could we do to make it better now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mean the question more than rhetorically, but I found myself searching for an answer, and Melanie searched, too. We found nothing in the brief second we had to consider the matter; there was nothing to be found, I was sure. But we both knew we would be searching again when we were done with this asinine tour and had a chance to think. If we lived that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatcha need, kid?\" Jeb asked without looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wondering what you\u0027re doing,\" Jamie answered, his voice striving for nonchalance and only just failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb stopped when he got to me and turned to look at Jamie. \"Takin\u0027 her for a tour of the place. Just like I do for any newcomer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another low grumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come?\" Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Sharon shake her head feverishly, her expression outraged. Jeb ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t bother me... if you can mind your manners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie shrugged. \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to move then-to knot my fingers together in front of me. I wanted so badly to push Jamie\u0027s untidy hair out of his eyes and then leave my arm around his neck. Something that would not go over well, I was sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Jeb said to us both. He took us back out the way we had come. Jeb walked on one side of me, Jamie on the other. Jamie seemed to be trying to stare at the floor, but he kept glancing up at my face-just like I couldn\u0027t help glancing down at his. Whenever our eyes met, we looked away again quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were about halfway down the big hall when I heard the quiet footsteps behind us. My reaction was instantaneous and unthinking. I skittered to one side of the tunnel, sweeping Jamie along with one arm so that I was between him and whatever was coming for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" he protested, but he did not knock my arm away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb was just as quick. The gun twirled out of its strap with blinding speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan and the doctor both raised their hands above their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can mind our manners, too,\" the doctor said. It was hard to believe that this soft-spoken man with the friendly expression was the resident torturer; he was all the more terrifying to me because his exterior was so benign. A person would be on her guard on a dark and ominous night, a person would be ready. But on a clear, sunny day? How would she know to flee when she couldn\u0027t see any place for danger to hide?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb squinted at Ian, the barrel of the gun shifting to follow his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean any trouble, Jeb. I\u0027ll be just as mannerly as Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Jeb said curtly, stowing his gun. \"Just don\u0027t test me. I haven\u0027t shot anybody in a real long time, and I sort of miss the thrill of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped. Everyone heard that and turned to see my horrified expression. The doctor was the first one to laugh, but even Jamie joined in briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a joke,\" Jamie whispered to me. His hand strayed from his side, almost as if he was reaching for mine, but he quickly shoved it into the pocket of his shorts. I let my arm-still stretched protectively in front of his body-drop, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the day\u0027s wasting,\" Jeb said, still a little surly. \"You\u0027ll all have to keep up, \u0027cause I\u0027m not waiting on you.\" He stalked forward before he was done speaking. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-21.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
