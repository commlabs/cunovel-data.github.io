{"id":10355,"no":184,"title":"CHAPTER 184","content":"“Last night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard. Do you remember? That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party. Everything was grey, and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse. We lost the road. The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed. Lysa started to cry, and when I shouted the fog seemed to swallow the sound. But Petyr knew where we were, and he rode back and found us...\u0026nbsp; “But there’s no one to find me now, is there? This time I have to find our own way, and it is hard, so hard.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “I keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want...” Catelyn hung her head. “I want,” she said once more, and then her words were gone.\u0026nbsp; After a time the candle guttered and went out. Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters, laying pale silvery bars across her father’s face. She could hear the soft whisper of his labored breathing, the endless rush of waters, the faint chords of some love song drifting up from the yard, so sad and sweet. “I loved a maid as red as autumn,” Rymund sang, “with sunset in her hair.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn never noticed when the singing ended. Hours had passed, yet it seemed only a heartbeat before Brienne was at the door. “MY lady,” she announced softly. “Midnight has come.”\u0026nbsp; Midnight has come, Father, she thought, and I must do my duty. She let go of his hand.\u0026nbsp; The gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in his nose. They found him bent over a tankard of ale and the remains of a pigeon pie, more than a little drunk. He squinted at them suspiciously. “Begging your forgiveness, m’lady, but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him, with his seal upon it.”\u0026nbsp; “Lord Edmure? Has my father died, and no one told me?”\u0026nbsp; The gaoler licked his lips. “No, m’lady, not as I knows.”\u0026nbsp; “You will open the cell, or you will come with me to Lord Hoster’s solar and tell him why you saw fit to defy me.”\u0026nbsp; His eyes fell. “As m’lady says.” The keys were chained to the studded leather belt that girdled his waist. He muttered under his breath as he sorted through them, until he found the one that fit the door to the Kingslayer’s cell.\u0026nbsp; “Go back to your ale and leave us,” she commanded. An oil lamp hung from a hook on the low ceiling. Catelyn took it down and turned up the flame. “Brienne, see that I am not disturbed.”\u0026nbsp; Nodding, Brienne took up a position just outside the cell, her hand resting on the pommel of her sword. “My lady will call if she has need of me.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn shouldered aside the heavy wood-and-iron door and stepped into foul darkness. This was the bowels of Riverrun, and smelled the part. Old straw crackled underfoot. The walls were discolored with patches of nitre. Through the stone, she could hear the faint rush of the Tumblestone. The lamplight revealed a pail overflowing with feces in one corner and a huddled shape in another. The flagon of wine stood beside the door, untouched. So much for that ploy. I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink it himself, I suppose.\u0026nbsp; Jaime raised his hands to cover his face, the chains around his wrists clanking. “Lady Stark,” he said, in a voice hoarse with disuse. “I fear I am in no condition to receive you.”\u0026nbsp; “Look at me, ser.”\u0026nbsp; “The light hurts my eyes. A moment, if you would.” Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood, and a shaggy beard covered his face, once\u0026nbsp; so like the queen’s. Glinting gold in the lamplight, the whiskers made him look like some great yellow beast, magnificent even in chains. His unwashed hair fell to his shoulders in ropes and tangles, the clothes were rotting on his body, his face was pale and wasted... and even so, the power and the beauty of the man were still apparent.\u0026nbsp; “I see you had no taste for the wine I sent you.”\u0026nbsp; “Such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect.”\u0026nbsp; “I can have your head off anytime I want. Why would I need to poison you?”\u0026nbsp; “Death by poison can seem natural. Harder to claim that my head simply fell off.” He squinted up from the floor, his cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light. “I’d invite you to sit, but your brother has neglected to provide me a chair.”\u0026nbsp; “I can stand well enough.”\u0026nbsp; “Can you? You look terrible, I must say. Though perhaps it’s just the light in here.” He was fettered at wrist and ankle, each cuff chained to the others, so he could neither stand nor lie comfortably. The ankle chains were bolted to the wall. “Are my bracelets heavy enough for you, or did you come to add a few more? I’ll rattle them prettily if you like.”\u0026nbsp; “You brought this on yourself,” she reminded him. “We granted you the comfort of a tower cell befitting your birth and station. You repaid us by trying to escape.”\u0026nbsp; “A cell is a cell. Some under Casterly Rock make this one seem a sunlit garden. One day perhaps I’ll show them to you.”\u0026nbsp; If he is cowed, he hides it well, Catelyn thought. “A man chained hand and foot should keep a more courteous tongue in his mouth, ser. I did not come here to be threatened.”\u0026nbsp; “No? Then surely it was to have your pleasure of me? It’s said that widows grow weary of their empty beds. We of the Kingsguard vow never to wed, but I suppose I could still service you if that’s what you need. Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to it.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn stared down at him in revulsion. Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as this one? “If you said that in my son’s hearing, he would kill you for it.”\u0026nbsp; “Only so long as I was wearing these.” Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her. “We both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat.”\u0026nbsp; “My son may be young, but if you take him for a fool, you are sadly mistaken... and it seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back.”\u0026nbsp; “Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers’ skirts as well? “\u0026nbsp; “I grow weary of this, ser. There are things I must know.”\u0026nbsp; “Why should I tell you anything?”\u0026nbsp; “To save your life.”\u0026nbsp; “You think I fear death?” That seemed to amuse him.\u0026nbsp; “You should. Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “What gods are those, Lady Catelyn? The trees your husband prayed to? How well did they serve him when my sister took his head off?” Jaime gave a chuckle. “If there are gods, why is the world so full of pain and injustice?”\u0026nbsp; “Because of men like you.”\u0026nbsp; “There are no men like me. There’s only me.”\u0026nbsp; There is nothing here but arrogance and pride, and the empty courage of a madman. I am wasting my breath with this one. If there was ever a spark of honor in him, it is long dead. “If you will not speak with me, so be it. Drink the wine or piss in it, ser, it makes no matter to me.” Her hand was at the door pull when he said, “Lady Stark.” She turned, waited. “Things go to rust in this damp,” Jaime went on. “Even a man’s courtesies. Stay, and you shall have your answers... for a price.”\u0026nbsp; He has no shame. “Captives do not set prices.”\u0026nbsp; “Oh, you’ll find mine modest enough. Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies, and he cannot even keep them straight. one day he says Cersei has been flayed, and the next it’s my father. Answer my questions and I’ll answer yours.”\u0026nbsp; “Truthfully? “\u0026nbsp; “Oh, it’s truth you want? Be careful, my lady. Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it’s served up.”\u0026nbsp; “I am strong enough to hear anything you care to say.”\u0026nbsp; “As you will, then. But first, if you’d be so kind... the wine. My throat is raw.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn hung the lamp from the door and moved the cup and flagon closer. Jaime sloshed the wine around his mouth before he swallowed. “Sour and vile,” he said, “but it will do.” He put his back to the wall, drew his knees up to his chest, and stared at her. “Your first question, Lady Catelyn?”\u0026nbsp; Not knowing how long this game might continue, Catelyn wasted no time. “Are you Joffrey’s father?”\u0026nbsp; “You would never ask unless you knew the answer.”\u0026nbsp; “I want it from your own lips.”\u0026nbsp; He shrugged. “Joffrey is mine. As are the rest of Cersei’s brood, I suppose.”\u0026nbsp; “You admit to being your sister’s lover?”\u0026nbsp; “I’ve always loved my sister, and you owe me two answers. Do all my kin still live?”\u0026nbsp; “Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross, I am told.”\u0026nbsp; Jaime was unmoved. “Uncle Dolt, my sister called him. it’s Cersei and Tyrion who concern me. As well as my lord father.”\u0026nbsp; “They live, all three.” But not long, if the gods are good.\u0026nbsp; Jaime drank some more wine. “Ask your next.”\u0026nbsp; Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie. “How did my son Bran come to fall?”\u0026nbsp; “I flung him from a window.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant. If I had a knife, I would kill him now, she thought, until she remembered the girls. Her throat constricted as she said, “You were a knight, sworn to defend the weak and innocent.”\u0026nbsp; “He was weak enough, but perhaps not so innocent. He was spying on us.\u0026nbsp; “Bran would not spy.”\u0026nbsp; “Then blame those precious gods of yours, who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see.”\u0026nbsp; “Blame the gods?” she said, incredulous. “Yours was the hand that threw him. You meant for him to die.”\u0026nbsp; His chains chinked softly. “I seldom fling children from towers to improve their health. Yes, I meant for him to die.”\u0026nbsp; “And when he did not, you knew your danger was worse than ever, so you gave your catspaw a bag of silver to make certain Bran would never wake.”\u0026nbsp; “Did I now?” Jaime lifted his cup and took a long swallow. “I won’t deny we talked of it, but you were with the boy day and night, your maester and Lord Eddard attended him frequently, and there were guards, even those damned direwolves... it would have required cutting my way through half of Winterfell. And why bother, when the boy seemed like to die of his own accord?”\u0026nbsp; “If you lie to me, this session is at an end.” Catelyn held out her hands, to show him her fingers and palms. “The man who came to slit Bran’s throat gave me these scars. You swear you had no part in sending him? “\u0026nbsp; “On my honor as a Lannister.”\u0026nbsp; “Your honor as a Lannister is worth less than this.” She kicked over the waste pail. Foul-smelling brown ooze crept across the floor of the cell, soaking into the straw.\u0026nbsp; Jaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as his chains would allow. “I may indeed have shit for honor, I won’t deny it, but I have never yet hired anyone to do my killing. Believe what you will, Lady Stark, but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.”\u0026nbsp; Gods be merciful, he’s telling the truth. “If you did not send the killer, your sister did.”\u0026nbsp; “If so, I’d know. Cersei keeps no secrets from me.”\u0026nbsp; “Then it was the Imp.”\u0026nbsp; “Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran. He wasn’t climbing around outside of anyone’s window, spying.”\u0026nbsp; “Then why did the assassin have his dagger?”\u0026nbsp; “What dagger was this?”\u0026nbsp; “It was so long,” she said, holding her hands apart, “plain, but finely made, with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt. Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day.”\u0026nbsp; Lannister poured, drank, poured, and stared into his wine cup.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45610.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:02:31 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:02:31 AM"}
