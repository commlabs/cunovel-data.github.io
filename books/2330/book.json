But when these men start to die at alarming rates, murder rears its ugly head. It\u0027s clear someone is determined to kill them all. Hired by one of the members, Matt Scudder, ex-cop and recovering alcoholic, enters the world of privilege, which may as well be on another planet from the world of street hustlers and career criminals he\u0027s so familiar with. As the case draws Matt deeper and deeper, he\u0027s forced to look at his own life--his work, his loves, his friendships and his destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:50 AM"}
