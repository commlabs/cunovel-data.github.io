Did he ever follow up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. If I could find Alex—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s gotta be a reason,” Garrett insisted. “So this Brazos guy asked some questions. So what? That doesn’t mean Alex—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Garrett, Alex should’ve said something. He didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about this Lindy guy? How do you know he isn’t Calavera?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was Lindy’s daughter who died,” I said. “He isn’t an assassin. I mean…he wants to kill somebody in cold blood, but he’s not that assassin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” Garrett grumbled. “That clears it right up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The poor man.” Maia sipped her red-raspberry-leaf tea. She looked over at Lindy, who sat in conversation with Jose. Jose looked uneasy to have the old lawyer’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The poor man?” I asked Maia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He lost his daughter and granddaughters. How would you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like tracking down Calavera and butchering him. But I wouldn’t do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I said. “I’d think about doing it, but you’d kick my butt if I tried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lindy has nothing left to lose,” Maia said. “No family. His career is behind him. He’s too old to care about jail time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think I should give him his gun back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the contrary. I think he may be more dangerous than this assassin. More unpredictable. But I also don’t want to see him killed. If Calavera finds out why he’s here—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still think Lindy is nuts,” Garrett said. “You sure he doesn’t have another gun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure,” I admitted. “And speaking of that, give me back the .357.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett looked offended. “I’m your brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A good reason for extreme caution. Gun, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett muttered a few curses, but he gave me Maia’s gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy Buffett kept singing about Key West. The time must’ve been well past one in the morning, and everybody looked even more tired than I felt. Ty was out cold from whatever medication his friends had given him. I kind of envied him. Chase and Markie were teaching Imelda to play Spit in the Ocean, which probably had some sort of cosmic significance when played in a hurricane. Lane had made herself a nest of blankets next to the wall. She was curled into a fetal position, but her eyes were wide open. Mr. Lindy was still talking to Jose, who was looking frazzled and soaked. Ceiling plaster flecked his black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be back,” Garrett said, apparently reading my mind. “He won’t do anything crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you’re right. What was in the envelope he gave you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett’s face darkened. “Just personal stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing about Calavera.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d tell me if it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, little bro. It’s cool. Alex will be back. The power came back on. Alex must’ve done that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t so sure. The generator seemed about as predictable as the storm tonight. I also noticed that Garrett had not answered my question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you told me Alex was having some problems even before this weekend, what did you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett folded the bottom of his Hawaiian shirt like he was rolling a joint. “Money problems. The hotel wasn’t keeping afloat too well. Maybe there was more. I don’t know. He said he and Chris…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were arguing?” I supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. But don’t get ideas, little bro. It doesn’t mean anything. You know Alex couldn’t hurt a soul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered Alex’s steely look the afternoon he pushed me out of the boat, into the water with the blood and the sharks. I wasn’t sure Garrett was being completely honest. I wanted to know what Alex had given him in that envelope. But I also knew my brother well enough to know I couldn’t force the issue. He’d tell me only when he was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys get some sleep,” I told them. “I’ll keep watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia closed her eyes without protest. “Wake me if somebody else dies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett looked over at Lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead,” I said. “She could use some comfort.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me, like he was trying to detect sarcasm. But he didn’t look too hard, or maybe he just didn’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night, then,” he said. “And you watch. Alex is gonna prove you wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure when I fell asleep. I must have been too exhausted to even notice I was fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dreamed I was teaching a class at UTSA. We were discussing The Pearl, talking about grief and the death of children. It was raining in the classroom. The students were trying to take notes but their laptops and legal pads were getting soaked. Lindy’s daughter, Rachel, was one of the students. Ty, Markie and Chase were there. So was Imelda, holding a baby in either arm. Ralph Arguello sat in the back of the room, a beach umbrella over his desk. He kept grinning at me like he found my lecture amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI talked about the Black Plague and medieval parenthood. I discussed the sociological theory that parents in the Middle Ages, who were so accustomed to loss, did not have the same emotional attachment to children as modern parents. Personally, I didn’t buy that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not, vato?” Ralph asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just because death was more commonplace,” I said, “doesn’t mean life was cheaper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph smiled. “I love this guy. He thinks he’s a professor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe students shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Rachel Brazos and Imelda and Ty were all watching me intently. Rain pattered against their papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the podium. My lecture notes had disappeared. “The, uh, intense emotion in The Pearl—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People don’t change,” Ralph interrupted. “They let grief tear them up. That’s what you’re saying, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you had to look in a book for that, vato?” Ralph laughed. “Why don’t you look around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tres.” Maia was shaking my arm. “The water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up groggily. “Your water broke?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might’ve still been dreaming. The carpet was spongy with salt water. Garrett was rowing around in his chair, waking people up. His wheels made strange squishy sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, get up.” He shook Mr. Lindy, who was slumped in the armchair. “Your shoes are wet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLane paced nervously, a blanket wrapped around her like a queen’s robe. Chase and Markie were stirring on the floor. Their clothes were drenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” Chase said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater flowed down the steps into the parlor. The hall looked like a wood-paneled storm drain. The storm was still roaring outside, but louder now, like the waves were right against the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and helped Maia to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImelda ran in from the kitchen. “The basement is flooding. The señor’s body—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t worry about that,” Maia said, trying to sound calm. “We need to get out of this room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Imelda,” I said. “Help me with Mrs. Navarre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maid seemed glad to have something to do. She took Maia’s other arm and together we walked toward the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look how fast the water’s coming in.” Lane’s face was ashen. “Where are we supposed to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Up,” I told her. “The second floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if that floods?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett and I exchanged looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, darlin’,” he told Lane. “We’ve made it this far. Everything’s gonna be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wheeled himself to the steps. Several inches of water were swirling in the foyer, racing down the hallway. “I don’t swim too well, little bro.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t have to,” I promised. “Leave the chair and let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded uneasily, then slipped out of his wheelchair and hand-walked up the steps. As he navigated the hall, his torso in the water, he looked like a man wading up a deep, unfriendly river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting Maia upstairs wasn’t easy. The stairs creaked and groaned. Below us, the first floor sounded like a public swimming pool, water sloshing everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was possible the whole hotel would get washed away. I knew that. But I didn’t see any alternative other than getting into the middle of the building and hoping it didn’t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe settled everyone into a row of guest rooms on the second floor. Imelda bustled around making sure we all had enough sheets and flashlights. I figured the generator would go out again any moment, but strangely the power stayed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia got comfortable on one twin bed while Garrett and Lane collapsed on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fiddled with the nightstand radio and to my surprise found a garbled AM station. Three-twenty A.M. and the tail end of the storm was coming ashore. Winds of one hundred thirty miles an hour. Massive flooding from Port Lavaca to Port Isabel. Fifteen-foot waves. On the bright side, the rainfall should lessen by midday. The Spurs were playing tonight in game seven of the playoffs. Anyone who was still alive would have something to look forward to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was shouting in the room next to us. It sounded like Ty, Markie and Chase had gotten a second wind and Mr. Lindy was trying to referee. I decided not to interfere. They probably needed the exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead count: Maia seemed all right for the moment. Garrett and Lane were fine. The three college guys and Benjamin Lindy were next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex,” I said. “Did he ever come back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t seen him,” Garrett admitted. “I thought for sure…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t finish. Even he looked worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Ralph Arguello, grinning in the raining classroom. Maybe you should just look around, vato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Imelda,” I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to the doorway, her arms full of towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you seen Alex Huff?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, señor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is his bedroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down, hugging the towels to her chest. “Mr. Huff is very private about his room, señor. I don’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to show me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJose appeared next to her, breathing hard. His pants were wet from the knees down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“¿Que pasa?” he asked his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He…he wants to see Señor Huff’s room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJose frowned. “We will show him, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go, too,” Garrett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said. “Stay here. Take care of Lane and Maia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett didn’t look pleased, but the fact that I’d included Lane made it difficult for him to say no. Lane was curled on the bed, staring forlornly at the wall as if it would blow apart any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” Garrett said. “But, little bro, nothing crazy, okay?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rebel-island-tres-navarre-7/page-22.html","bookId":2422,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:57 PM"}
