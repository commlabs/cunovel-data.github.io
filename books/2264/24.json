I winced from the cold and opened the stupid clutch. I pulled out the phone and sighed, \"Twelve missed calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething silver caught my eye. I frowned; I’d forgotten I had put it in there. I reached in and clutched it in my fingers. It always made me feel stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Luce asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my palm and ran my thumb across the engraving, \"Locket from my dad for graduation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it say?\" she smiled sweetly, making her face light instead of intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back, \"It\u0027s his grad date and mine. We both graduated from Fort Huachuca, twenty-five years apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Cool. Your old man was well known. He ran some crazy ops, back in the day. The cold war had to be awesome.\" She sat on the folding chair across from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. He worked a lot during the cold war.\" My level of pride for the man was immeasurable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop leaned his head in, \"You wanna take a shower with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned and was about to throw my shoe at him, but he winked and scratched his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, \"Sure.\" The house must have been full of bugs. I slipped the locket around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came and picked me up in his arms, \"You can\u0027t walk to the shower with that bum foot.\" he grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce laughed, \"You wouldn’t rather my help with the shower, Evie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked an eyebrow, \"Pretty sure I would rather it, but I have a really disturbing desire to see what he\u0027s packing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce laughed, \"You know it’s one of two things, Evie, and neither is a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop winced, \"You guys say we\u0027re dirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Payback. We owe you for the centuries of oppression and abuse.\" I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed the stairs, \"Do not even get me started on the things you owe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the bathroom and closed the door. He started the shower and turned on the fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know what was happening, but he pulled his shirt off and I smiled like an idiot. He lifted mine off and then dropped his jogging pants but kept his briefs on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my pants down and stepped out of the runners and socks gingerly. My ankle was pretty swollen. At least it wasn’t a sprain. I stood in just my panties and bra and shivered slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted me up and carried me to the shower. Our skin against each other was hot and sweaty. He closed the door and whispered, \"I was apart of something about your dad once. That locket reminded me of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach sank, \"I don’t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed, \"I saw files once about a mole op your dad was heading up. The review of the op basically didn’t happen, until after he had died. They were looking for something. They felt that he had kept vital information from his reports, purposely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of it was about James or me. It was about my dad. I was a pawn. Was that possible? I shook my head, \"My dad was a hero. He never betrayed his country. He died for this country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"I didn’t say he was traitor. I said he kept things from the files purposely. He might have been keeping it safe from eyes and ears for a reason. I was new when it happened and, honestly, the locket is the only reason I remember it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered, \"You have a photographic memory. I\u0027ve seen it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I do, and I remember it like it was yesterday, they had taken all your dad’s things into custody, nothing was cleared for your mom to have from his office. I was new; we were to go through his things, cataloguing everything and boxing it up. Everything was considered to be suspicious and we were to run all documents through known codes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"He wasn’t a mole. He was a good spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes trailed down my throat to the locket. He reached up and grabbed it between his fingers, grazing the swell of my chest. \"There was a receipt for a locket. The surveillance team had seen him buying it. We never found it though. A team was sent to your parents’. We searched everything, the safe, the cellar. There was nothing ever found. They were pissed about us not finding it. I remember that. I also remember, that James let them conduct a thorough search of your house and nothing was ever turned up there. It was way back in the day. I was brand new. We were interviewed separately afterward, about the things we found, and the ways they were handled.\" His eyes twinkled, \"Weird way to handle a deceased man\u0027s effects. Especially when he’s a national hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged myself harder, \"He gave the locket to me, the week he died. It was four years late. He had already given me tons of things for graduation, so it seemed strange he was giving me this too. But when I saw the dates, I was pretty excited. He never wanted me to enlist. Then, he never wanted me to go CI, even though my entire life had been spent preparing for it. The last straw was James. We had fought because he hated James. He never seemed happy for me, or the choices I made. I told him I didn’t want to see him, it was after the wedding. He came and picked me up in a weird car I had never seen before, and we drove to a place by the water. We sat in the car in the rain and he gave it to me and told me he was sorry for saying the mean things. He was glad I was leaving, retiring when the baby came. He never wanted this life for me. I thought it was because, he thought I couldn’t do it, which hurt. He had always protested when I made choices, but then he was proud of me when I completed them. This felt like he was glad I was leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop’s eyes burned down on mine for a moment. I couldn’t help but pull back and stop the moment, we were obviously having. He wiped the water from his face, \"He wanted you safe from it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up into his face and nodded, “I think so. I think he wanted me out of that life and away from James. At least if I wasn’t at work, I wasn’t the laughing stock of the office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked conflicted about things, \"We need to run those dates and see if it\u0027s some kind of code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrible feeling bit into my stomach, \"Are my kids safe?\" I asked feeling the nerves filling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head, \"You remember the orders I gave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded back, preparing myself for the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was FBI. It wasn’t CIA or military run. I have a friend in the FBI. No one will know where they are. I don’t even know. I gave the orders because Martin\u0027s team specializes in mole operations. I wasn’t sure what we were dealing with and I know he’s the best. They make the snap decision in the air and the pilots are members of the team. When you wanted them hidden, I had a bad feeling you knew something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally breathed, \"Oh my God. Thank God. You\u0027re much better at this, than I\u0027ve been giving you credit for.\" The move was smart. It was something my dad would have done. He never trusted anyone. I looked up at him, \"Where are we gonna go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered back, \"Not a fucking clue. If we leave here and you don’t go back to Servario, we won’t have any help or resources. The people looking for answers in your dad\u0027s shit were my bosses, our bosses. They told me not to take you from Servario. I disobeyed a direct order. Until we have some answers, we need to be off grid. This shower is the only place they can’t hear us if we whisper. Not to mention we probably have about an hour, before they arrive here and take us into custody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and looked down at the locket, \"It\u0027s just a necklace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced a grin, \"Nothing about your dad was ever simple. He was a genius. Let\u0027s not talk about this again, until we\u0027re out of here. They always have eyes on the house. We need to get out of here and regroup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, getting a face full of water. I sputtered, \"I know where we can go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and stopped the water. We stood there in the dripping and silence, he clenched his jaw. I looked down and forced my thoughts away from his lips. I heard him open his mouth and interrupted whatever he was about to say, \"Pass me a towel, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he sounded weird. I didn’t want to think about it. I didn’t want any of it. I wanted to be a parent and a widow, even if it was fake, and forget the rest. I defiantly didn’t want to think about the things I had done with Servario, or the fact I was still thinking about him. The memory of his face in parking garage tugged at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe dried off, not speaking. I hobbled, still soaked, to the bedroom and changed into the spare clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs we met in the kitchen, \"Who wants breakfast?\" Coop asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce nodded and glanced at Jack, who nodded back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"IHOP?\" Luce asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Yeah, I love it there.\" It was a lie. I hated all chain restaurants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Luce to the dining room, which was filled with black cases. She opened them and started putting guns in her pants and boots. I followed suit. It felt weird to hold a piece again, it had been so long. I had only trained with them; I never was forced to work with one, ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk to the car was tense and awkward. If the eyes on the house were suspicious before, they would be increasingly so, after we left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten - Hot-wire my heart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car we stole, after we ditched the car we left in, was a beater. The vibration was annoying me. I looked at Luce next to me in the backseat and frowned, \"We need a different car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, \"I know. We\u0027ll ditch this one and take another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop looked back at me, \"Where are we going? I got on the eighty like you asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, \"Salt Lake City.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and laughed, \"My uncle Fitz lives there. He\u0027ll know what the heck is up with the locket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, \"Why is that? Why don’t we have a record of a Fitz? I’ve never seen that name before. Is it short for something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t get the smile off my face, as I shook my head, “No, he\u0027s not exactly an uncle.\" I was excited to see him, nonetheless. It had been years. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-24.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
