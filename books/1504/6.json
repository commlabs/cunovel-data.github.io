Later, he found himself back in the cheap inn, sleeping on the plank bed in his small room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had he returned? When had he returned? He didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else knew, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one knew where he had been for the past two days, and no one cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, this was evidence that his experiences in the last two days were not a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—A solitary box. A solitary, dark brown, oxhide box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Little Gao awoke, he found the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been placed on the little table next to his bed. The color and shape was exactly like the box he had opened before. Even the spring lock was the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this box was really as unique as the other box, how could the man possibly leave it here for him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao didn’t believe it was, but he couldn’t help but be intrigued, and couldn’t help but open it to take a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, he hadn’t forgotten the lesson he learned last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t very fun to get knocked out every time you opened a box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo by the time the box opened, Little Gao was already standing outside the window. Cold wind blew in through the window like a knife. Whatever type of knockout powder there was, it would definitely be swept clean away by the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Little Gao slowly entered through the window and circled around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he saw what was in the box, he was a little bit disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only things inside were some pearls, jewelry and jade, along with a pile of gold leaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was enough to buy the whole street, enough to be able to hire a whole city of people to devote their lives to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the three days, he’d gone out carrying the solitary box, but his life hadn’t changed at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still lived at the cheapest inn, and ate the cheapest boiled cabbage noodle soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if he didn’t know what he could do with the contents of the box, and didn’t know that he had already become filthy rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he hadn’t thought about it and didn’t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really had no concept of the value of money. And he wasn’t willing to let his lifestyle be changed by anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the twenty-fifth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, his life changed. It changed in a very strange way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bright day. After eating noodles at the noodle shop, he began preparing to go back and sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no word from Sima Chaoqun and Zhuo Donglai, and he didn’t know when exactly he should prepare to duel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he felt no nervousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter giving him the enormous gift, the mysterious black-clothed man had not sent any messages either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was prepared to give the box back to him at any moment, so he carried it with him at all times. But he was afraid he might never see the man again, and so the box had turned into a burden for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Little Gao wasn’t too worried about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere didn’t seem to be anything in the world that could affect his mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf someone wanted him to wait for two days, he would wait for two days. If they wanted him to wait for two months, he would wait for two months. In any case, he knew that eventually in life he would reach a time when he had to wait for news about something, so what was the point in getting anxious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had already made a firm resolution; before this decisive battle, he wouldn’t do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must definitely keep his body in top physical condition, and maintain a good, balanced mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis afternoon, as he walked back along the long, snow-packed street, he realized that someone was watching him. Little Gao didn’t need to turn back and look; he had already guessed who the person was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night when he was eating, he had noticed someone staring at him, the way a cat stares at a mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person wore raggedy clothes and a floppy hat; his body was not very tall, and he had a big beard; his footsteps when he walked were very light. It seemed he practiced kung fu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao had never seen this person before, and had no idea why he might be watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never thought of himself as the type of person who would attract the interest of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter walking for a bit he couldn’t hear the footsteps behind him, so he let out a relieved sigh. And then suddenly, from the alley right next to him, flew forth a rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a coarse rope, tied by slipknot into a noose. In an instant, it had encircled Little Gao’s neck, wrapping around it in a strangely accurate fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a person’s neck is encircled by a noose, one’s eyes will bulge out, one’s tongue will protrude, and one’s breathing can be cut off at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao understood all of this. So when the rope pulled, he flew along with it, like a kite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person in the alley pulling the rope was the man with the beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled hard, but unfortunately the rope had already snapped, and the part wrapped around the neck of his target already thrown back toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Beard turned around and ran. He ran for a while, and then had a strange feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause, as it turned out, Little Gao was not chasing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran two more paces, and then stopped, looking back to see if he was being pursued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and looked at Little Gao, shocked. “Why aren’t you chasing me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was very clear, and Little Gao’s response even clearer. “Why should I chase you?” he retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Beard started. “Don’t you know that I just tried to use that rope to strangle you to death?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you know, then why would you let me go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you didn’t actually strangle me to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you must at least want to ask who I am, and why I want to strangle you to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t want to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I really don’t want to know.” When he finished speaking, he turned around and started walking away, not even looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Beard was speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never met a single person in his life like Little Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Little Gao had also never met a person like him before. Even though Little Gao didn’t chase him, he chased Little Gao, and once again pulled out the rope. He quickly tied a noose and threw it around Little Gao’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw accurately, and Little Gao was once again caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, even though he was caught, it didn’t do any good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how hard the man pulled, Little Gao just stood there. Not only was his neck unharmed, but he didn’t move an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of a person are you,” asked Big Beard. “How come I can’t strangle you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because in addition to my neck, I also have fingers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the noose slipped around his neck, he had simply used a finger to block it, right in front of his larynx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flexed his finger, and Big Beard was suddenly pulled toward him. He turned around, and Big Beard’s head bumped into his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your rope game isn’t very good,” said Little Gao. “Can you play any other games?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can play blade games,” said Big Beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still wasn’t standing firmly, but a dagger appeared in his hand, stabbing toward Little Gao’s soft midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, his blade wasn’t fast enough. Little Gao used a finger to tap his wrist, and the dagger went flying away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks like you’re letting me go again.” Little Gao sighed and shook his head. “Whatever game you play, they’re all useless against me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Beard had already fallen onto the ground. He suddenly used a move called “Straightening Carp.” His body flipped up, and his two legs wrapped around Little Gao’s head like a mahua dough twist. \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Little Gao never thought this would happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Beards legs were extremely nimble and flexible, and also very strong. Little Gao almost couldn’t breathe. The odor from the pants that covered the legs was quite ripe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao couldn’t take it any longer. Using a very strange method, his body twisted, rolled, turned, and heaved; Big Beard was thrown off and slammed onto the ground. His pants split open, revealing his two legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pants had been about to split from the very beginning, and when they split they were nearly completely destroyed, and revealed almost all of the two legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, Little Gao was shocked into speechlessness. It was as if he had just seen a beautiful fresh flower blossom out from a pile of muck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone has legs, but Little Gao had never before seen a pair of legs that looked as good as these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only had Little Gao never seen anything like them before, most people in the world had never seen anything like them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a few people in the world had ever laid eyes on these legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were slender, long and fit, their contour even, soft and graceful, the muscles flexible, the color of the skin milky white, like that of fresh milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao would never have dreamed that a dirty, stinky person like Big Beard would have legs like these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was even more unimaginable was that this bearded man who had just tried to use a rope to strangle him to death, and then tried to use a blade to kill him, would suddenly start crying. He covered his face with his hands and cried like a child, sounding grieved and heartbroken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao had planned to leave without even turning his head, as he had moments before, but couldn’t hold back from asking, “Why are you crying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like crying, I’m happy to cry, I want to cry. It’s none of your business!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grown man with such a big beard, speaking words that sounded like as unreasonable as a child, so much so that his voice seemed to have changed to that of a child’s… What kind of freak was this, and how could Little Gao possible continue to worry about him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao decided to ignore him and leave, but Big Beard suddenly shouted, “Stop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should I stop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to leave just like that? It’s that easy for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t I go? Don’t you still want to strangle me to death, or stab me to death? Leaving like this, I’m actually treating you very well. What else do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to dig your eyeballs out,” Big Beard said. “Take your two eyeballs and dig them out of your eye sockets!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed again. “I’m not insane, why would I dig my eyeballs out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you saw my legs,” said Big Beard. “These legs are not for just anyone to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao had to admit that the legs were very special, and especially good-looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he hadn’t looked on purpose, and looking at someone’s legs didn’t count as something incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re not happy,” he said, “You can look at my legs. Look at them as long as you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dog farts!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a dog, and I didn’t fart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you’re not a dog, because you’re stupider than a dog. All the dogs under heaven are smarter than you, whether they are big dogs or small dogs or male dogs or female dogs, they are all one hundred times smarter than you. Because you’re a pig.” Big Beard was getting more and more angry. Suddenly he jumped up. “You pig, don’t tell me you still can’t tell I’m a woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could you be a woman? I don’t believe it,” he said numbly. “How could a woman have a beard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Beard appeared to be on the verge of going crazy with anger. Suddenly, she ripped the beard off and threw it at Little Gao’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body flew forward as well, waist twisting, her two legs once again entangling Little Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo smooth legs, completely lacking any hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Little Gao really couldn’t move, he could only look at her and force a smile. “I have no hatred or enmity with you, why do you have to treat me like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’ve taken a fancy to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao was petrified. Luckily the beardless Big Beard quickly went on: “Don’t feel full of yourself. What I’ve taken a fancy to isn’t you yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you take a fancy with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That box of yours,” sad the beardless young woman. “If you just give me this box, I won’t come bother you again. You’ll never even see me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what’s inside this box?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I know,” said the young woman. “Your box has gold and jewels worth at least eighty to one-hundred thousand pieces of silver.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao was obviously astonished, because he had never opened the box in front of anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only did she not answer the question, she asked one: “Do you know who my father is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a god among thieves. A thief god with miraculous hands. He’s stolen things from everywhere under heaven, and has never been caught.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great! Great skill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, he falls short of my grandfather. Do you know who my grandfather is?” she asked Little Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a great robber. If he sees people, he robs them. If he sees ghosts, he robs them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao let out a sigh. “So it turns out your family has three generations in the same profession.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re finally smartening up,” Lady Big Beard said. “How could a third generation member of this profession not know what things are inside your box?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve heard before that masters of this profession have that ability. From the way someone walks, they can figure out the value of what that person is carrying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely correct,” said the young woman. “But, I can’t tell what type of person you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your box has gold and jewels in it, but the only thing you eat every day is a bowl of boiled cabbage noodle soup that costs three or four coins. Are you some kind of miser? Or just some freak?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The box I have might be full of gold and jewels, but unfortunately they aren’t mine. Even if I wanted to give them to you, I couldn’t. And I can guarantee you, even if your skill was ten times greater than it is, you should forget about trying to steal it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman suddenly sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know I can’t steal it from you. But regardless, I had to give it a shot, even at the risk of my life. I’ll keep trying even if I die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because if I don’t come up with fifty thousand pieces of silver in the next three days, I’m dead for sure.” Her eyes rolled as tears streamed out. “I’m thinking that, other than you, where else can I get fifty thousand pieces of silver?” Her tears fell like raindrops. “I can see that you’re a good person. Please, help me. I’ll be grateful to you for my entire life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao was already starting to soften. “Why do you have to come up with fifty thousand pieces of silver in three days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because Sima Chaoqun’s Great Protection Agency will definitely require fifty thousand to escort me home safely. My home is in Northeast China, without them to take me there, I’ll be dead on the roadside at any time, with no one to take care of my corpse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed coldly. “Charging fifty thousand to escort someone to Northeast China. I think that’s just too dark-hearted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t blame them,” said the young woman. “Escorting me won’t be easy. If I was Sima Chaoqun, my starting fee might even be higher.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the people who want to kill me are too fiendish and terrifying. Nobody is willing to go up against them. You would never believe that there is anyone under heaven as brutal and ruthless as them.” Her body began to quiver, and even though ash covered her face, you could still see that it twisted with panic-stricken terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed she truly feared for her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are they?” blurted out Little Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like the young woman didn’t hear his question. Tears pouring down, she said, “I know they won’t let me go. I know that they can kill me any time they want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if she had some evil and inauspicious premonition, like a wild animal who knew a snare lay ahead, with hunters coming from behind to complete the kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough premonitions of this sort of usually unexplainable, they are often correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, from the tops of the short walls on either side of the narrow alley, hidden weapons shot forth. From the left, a rain-like cluster of silver needles, from the right, several shining flashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei’s reaction was extremely fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used the box in his right hand, as well as his cloth-wrapped bundle, to block the rain of needles coming from the left side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already carrying the young woman, who was still had her legs wrapped around him, so he tilted to the left and flew up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at the same time, he heard her emit a sighing moan, and he felt her two legs slacken. She fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao wasn’t pulled down with her. On the contrary, he shot up, tapping his left foot with his right, borrowing strength to create strength. He flew up nearly nine feet into the air. Behind the walls on either side of the narrow alley he could see a person fleeing. They were extremely agile, their lightness kung fu not weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they had fled several meters away to stand on the eaves of the buildings, Little Gao had alighted onto the top of the wall. Suddenly, the two figures spun around and stared at him. Hideous masks covered their faces, and their eyes brimmed with fierce, ruthless maliciousness. One of them spoke to him in a cold, raspy voice: “Friend, your kung fu is good. To master a lightness kung fu like ‘Climbing the Cloud Ladder’ is not an easy thing. It would really be a pity for you to die at such a young age.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thankfully, I don’t want to die at the moment.

Whether you’re eating or sleeping, no matter what you’re doing, you could suddenly find a hidden blade pressed against your throat. Or when you wake up, you might find a meat cleaver slowly slicing your neck.” His voice was sinister. “No matter who involves themselves in this matter, they won’t meet a happy end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao let out a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This thing doesn’t sound very fun.

However, there was someone lying on the ground. After she had fallen, she hadn’t moved at all. Her long, glistening legs were quickly turning purple from the freezing cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, she had nothing to do with Little Gao, but Little Gao couldn’t let her and her two bare legs freeze to death in the snow of the narrow alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer injury was on her back.
