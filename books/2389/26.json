Just tell me when and where, and I’ll be there with a tux on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Spencer’s mouth wobbled into a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase was about to say something else, but then the door behind them swung open. An old lady with a kerchief over her head and a bunch of bags in her arms struggled out the door. Chase stepped up and held it open for her. The old lady smiled at him. “That’s so sweet of you, dear!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem at all,” Chase said, giving her a small bow. He and Spencer scrambled through the door before it slammed closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall was dark and smelled like spicy curry. There were two apartment doors on the ground floor, then a set of stairs. Spencer could see another apartment door up the first flight. There had to be at least four or five more apartments in the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Chase. “So what do we do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go to Four-B, I guess,” Chase said, peering up the stairs. Then he turned to the front door again. “You go up. I’ll be right behind you, keeping watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer nodded, then bolted up the stairs, passing three doors painted red, orange, and blue. Another blue door still had a Christmas wreath, despite the fact it was May. Another orange one had a pile of mail on the mat. The railing wobbled when she grabbed it for support. She could hear Chase’s footsteps on the stairs behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the top floor, light flickered behind 4B. Swallowing hard, Spencer exchanged a look with Chase, who was a few steps down, then crept up to it and pressed her ear to the door. Could Ali’s nurse really be inside? What if Ali was inside, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should I do?” she whispered to Chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. Knock? he mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, Spencer rapped once, then twice. Then she listened. The television’s volume didn’t change, but she thought she heard a sigh and couch springs squeak. There was a click in the hall, and she whipped around, on alert. “What was that?” she whispered to Chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” he whispered back, eyes wide. Then he walked farther down the hall. He stopped at the second-to-last door on the right and stepped closer to it, inspecting the knob. He pressed his ear to the door, as if listening, but then he lost his balance, falling forward and softly slapping the door with his palm. Spencer covered her eyes. “Shhh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry!” Chase jumped away from the door as if anticipating a ghost was going to spring out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, it was eerily silent. Then, a creak sounded above her, and she looked up. And all at once . . . boom. There was a crunch of metal, and a whoosh of air, and then more banging and clanging sounds. Spencer jumped back as an attic door in the ceiling opened and items tumbled down. First an unwieldy coatrack, then a mounted deer head, its antlers sharpened to knifepoints, and then a bowling ball. The ball crashed onto the floor next to her and careened down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spencer?” Chase called through the dust. “Jesus. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I don’t know,” Spencer said, realizing she’d fallen to the ground. When she touched her face, it was slick. She brought her hand away—it was sweat or tears, not blood. More dust cascaded from the ceiling. The trapdoor hung precariously on one hinge, the screws dangerously loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” Chase said, catapulting over the rubble, grabbing her hand, and dragging her down the steps. Heads poked out of apartment doors, mouths agape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was weird,” Spencer said shakily as they barreled down more stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weird doesn’t even begin to describe that,” Chase said. He glanced up the stairwell. Another loud thunk sounded. “It’s almost like it was planned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shivered. She’d been thinking the same thing. It was possible, perhaps, that Ali or her helper had planted this address online for Chase to find. And then snuck in here and filled the attic with dangerous things. Rigging the door to fall at just the right moment . . . on just the right person’s head . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA’s evil message swirled in her mind: I did it. And guess what? You’re next. Maybe this had all been a trap. And maybe A’s warning was coming true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Unexpected Guest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna pulled into the Bill Beach parking lot, her burner phone wedged between her shoulder and her ear. Screw the no-technology rule. This was an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike’s voicemail beeped. “It’s me again,” Hanna pleaded. “I can explain. I want you back. I want to go to prom with you. I have a new cell phone—this is my number. Please, please, please call me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up and eyed her prom queen crown and scepter—she carried them with her everywhere. Tears pricked her eyes. She was not going to ruin her makeup, though. A future prom queen needed to look good even when she was cleaning up pee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen something in her bag bleated, she plunged her hand inside again, praying it was Mike. But it was her old phone. It had auto-logged onto the Bill Beach WiFi and downloaded a new e-mail from Agent Fuji. On instinct, Hanna deleted the message without even reading it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stomped through the double doors, threw on her scrubs, and kicked the mop bucket down the hall toward Graham’s partitioned-off area. She whipped back his curtains, not caring who saw her. Graham’s eyes were closed, but his mouth was working hard. Hanna pressed her ear close to his lips, but no sound came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just tell me who you saw,” Hanna growled, wanting to shake him. Couldn’t they, for once, get a freaking break? They could nail A and get Fuji off their backs. They could clear up this nonsense with the painting in Aria’s closet. She could make things right with Mike, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Graham didn’t make a sound. Hanna was so annoyed she stomped her foot hard. Her sole clacked loudly on the linoleum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hanna?” a voice called out. “Everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna turned around. Kyla sat up in bed, the bandages still covering her face. There was a pot of nail polish and an emery board in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, no,” Hanna admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyla made an mm noise. “Guy trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna walked closer. “How did you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you on the phone the other day,” Kyla said with a shrug. “So what did he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He won’t go to prom with me,” Hanna said miserably. “It’s a huge misunderstanding, and he thinks I’m lying about something—but I’m not. He’s being an idiot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So explain it to him,” Kyla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that easy,” Hanna sighed. She opened her mouth to try to tell Kyla why, but then a wave of exhaustion washed over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In that case, this will make you feel better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyla groped for something on the little tray next to her bed. She handed Hanna a small picture in a frame. It was a shot of the Hot Male Nurse in the changing room without a shirt on. Hanna snickered. “Where’d you get this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the orderlies took it with my phone.” Kyla sounded proud of herself. “I uploaded it to the Kodak site and had it printed at the gift shop. But you should have it, Hanna. You need the pick-me-up more than I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, but that’s okay.” Hanna studied Kyla’s bandages and withered arms and legs. A ridiculous feeling washed over her. Here she was, making a burn victim cheer her up. Had she lost all perspective?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned in closer, suddenly dying to know. “What happened to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyla fiddled with the jar of nail polish. “My brother and I were messing around in the garage when a can of sulfuric acid fell off a shelf . . . and onto me. That stuff works just like flames—burns your skin right off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna winced. “Is your whole face . . . ?” She trailed off, not knowing how to word it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gone? Messed up?” Kyla finished. She shook her head. “My cheeks are a mess. My chin, too. I need a lot of skin grafts, but you can’t do them all at once. I wasn’t as pretty as you, but I was okay-looking. Popular, even. But not anymore, huh? When I bust out of here, it’s gonna be, Here comes freak show!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trying to sound so brave and tough. Hanna’s heart clenched. How would she treat a girl like Kyla at Rosewood Day? The Old Hanna who’d been Ali’s and Mona’s friend would have been ruthless. But what about the girl she was today? Was this Hanna any better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched a bare spot on Kyla’s arm. “Listen. When you get these bandages off, I want to give you a makeover. Hair, makeup, skin, jewelry, fashion, everything. I’m really good at that sort of stuff, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyla made a strange noise at the back of her throat. “Why would you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna leaned closer. “Because you’re the coolest girl I’ve met in a long time. People need to see that, you know? They need to look past some stupid scars and grafts. You’re Kyla, and you’re fabulous. Got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyla laughed softly. “Okay,” she said after a moment. “You’re amazing, Hanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I’m awesome,” Hanna said lightly. But she really did feel good. She couldn’t wait to pick out Kyla’s colors and do her hair. And who knew? Maybe Kyla’s scars wouldn’t be that bad. Maybe Sean’s dad could work some kind of miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone bleated, startling Hanna so that she almost dropped it on the floor. Mike’s number flashed on the screen. She stared at Kyla in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it him?” Kyla whispered. Hanna nodded. “Well, answer it!” Kyla cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna swallowed hard and turned away. “Thank you for calling me back,” Hanna said into the phone. She scurried to the break room, even though she wasn’t on break yet, and flopped down on one of the couches. “Like I said, I can explain. The truth is, I really have been volunteering at the burn clinic. I’m here right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike sighed. “Hanna, at least tell me a better lie. You hate the burn clinic. You would never voluntarily work there again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m telling the truth.” Hanna picked at a loose thread on the upholstery. “The guy who got hurt in the blast is here—Graham. There’s something you don’t know: Just before that explosion went off, he chased Aria into the boiler room. They were both there when the bomb went off—Aria’s lucky she got out safe. We wanted to ask him some questions about it when he wakes up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath, wondering if Mike would buy her half-true story . . . and hoping her friends didn’t kill her for spilling some of it. Mike breathed in. “Aria never told me she was down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. She was afraid you’d freak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really think it’s a good idea to talk to this guy? He set off the bomb, right? What if he’s dangerous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mike, he’s covered in bandages and tubes—he’s not going to do anything. As for the bomb—I don’t really know. There was another person down there, too, at the time—it could have been him instead. That’s what I want to ask Graham about—if he wakes up.” She paused, then decided to ask: “Actually, do you remember where Noel was when the bomb went off? It would have been right when the talent show was about to start.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-26.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
