Why had I offered for him to stay? His assumption wasn’t too far off. Daemon didn’t strike me as the type to dig PG-13 slumber parties. I remembered the last and only time we’d shared a bed. Flushing, I stood. I didn’t want him to leave, but I didn’t…I didn’t know what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to get changed,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Need help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow. You’re so chivalrous, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widened, flashing deep dimples. “Well, the experience would be mutually beneficial. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay,” I ordered, then hurried upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly changed into a pair of sleep shorts and a pink thermal. Not the sexiest sleepwear, but as I washed my face and brushed my teeth, I decided it was the best choice. Anything else would give Daemon ideas. Hell, a paper sack would encourage him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left my bathroom and stopped. Daemon had not stayed. My smile slipped from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing by the window, his back to me. “I got bored.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t even gone five minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a short attention span.” He glanced back at me, eyes glittering. “Nice shorts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. There were stars on my shorts. “What are you doing up here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said I could stay.” He faced me, his gaze drifting to the bed. The room suddenly seemed too small, the bed even smaller. “I didn’t think you meant staying on the couch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I wasn’t even sure what I’d meant. I sighed. What was I doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing the room, he stopped in front of me. “I’m not going to bite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless you want me to,” he added with a devilish grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice,” I muttered, side-stepping him. Space was definitely needed. Not that it did much good. Heart pounding, I watched him kick off his shoes and then whip off his shirt. He moved to the button on his jeans. My eyes widened. “What—what are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting ready for bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re getting naked!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched his brow. “I do have boxers on. What? Do you expect me to sleep in my jeans?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did last time.” I felt the need to fan myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon laughed. “Actually, I had pajama bottoms on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he’d had a shirt on, but who was keeping track? I could’ve told him to leave, but I turned away, pretending to be engrossed with a book on my desk. Chills shot straight to my core when I heard the bed groan under his weight. Taking a shallow breath, I turned around. He was in bed, arms folded behind his head, an innocent look on his face. “This was a bad idea,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was probably the smartest idea you’ve ever had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my palms on my hips. “It’s going to take a lot more than Thanksgiving dinner and a Christmas tree to get laid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn. There goes my whole plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlustered, infuriated, and thrilled, I stared at him. So many emotions couldn’t be possible. My head was spinning as I stalked over to my side of the bed—oh my God, when had we developed sides?—and quickly slid under the covers. I did not want to know if he’d left the jeans on or not. “Can you turn off the light?” Darkness descended without him moving. Several moments passed. “That’s a handy ability.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes focused on the pale light peeking through the curtains. “Maybe one day I can be just as lazy as you and turn off lights without moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s something to aspire to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relaxed a fraction of an inch and smiled. “God, you’re so modest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Modesty is for saints and losers. I’m neither.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow, Daemon, just wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled onto his side, his breath stirring the hair along my neck. My heart leaped into my throat. “I can’t believe you haven’t kicked me out yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same here,” I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon weaseled his way closer, and, oh yeah, he’d gotten rid of his jeans. His bare legs brushed mine, and my heart rate spiked. “I really didn’t mean to make you cry earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped onto my back and stared up at him. He was raised on one elbow. Silky locks fell into his shining eyes. “I know. The whole thing you did, it was sort of amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just didn’t like the idea of you being alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow and steady breaths raised my chest. Like when he’d hugged me downstairs and I’d kissed him, I wanted to stop thinking. Impossible when his eyes held the intensity of a thousand suns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon reached out, brushing a strand of hair off my cheek with the tips of his fingers. Electricity shimmered through me. There was no denying the attraction—the pull that didn’t want to let either of us go. My gaze was fixed on his lips like an addict. Memories of the way they’d felt seared me. All of this was crazy. Inviting him to stay, getting in bed with him, and thinking what I was about him. Crazy. Exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. “We should go to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand palmed my cheek, and I wanted to touch him. I wanted to be closer. “We should,” he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting my hand, I brushed my fingers over his lips. They were pillowy soft yet firm. Intoxicating. Daemon’s eyes flared, and my stomach hollowed. He shifted his head closer and his lips brushed the corner of mine. His hands slid from my face and down my neck, and when he dipped his head again, his lips brushed over the tip of my nose. And then he kissed me. A slow-burning, toe-curling kiss that left me aching for so, so much more. I felt like I was spinning into that kiss, falling into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back with a groan and settled beside me, wrapping an arm around my waist. “Good night, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding, I let out a long sigh. “That’s all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon laughed. “That’s all…for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my lip, I willed my heart to slow down. It seemed to take forever. Then finally, I wiggled closer until he snaked an arm under my head. I turned onto my side, resting my cheek against his upper arm. Our breaths mingled as we lay there, staring at each other silently until his eyes drifted shut. For the second time that night, I admitted that maybe I’d been wrong about Daemon. Maybe I didn’t even know myself. And there was no wine to blame this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drifted off to sleep wondering what he meant by “for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Blake texted me and asked to meet him at the Smoke Hole Diner Friday evening, I didn’t know what to do. It seemed…wrong to have an early dinner with him when last night I’d slept in Daemon’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flushed. We didn’t do anything other than that one kiss, but it was just as intimate, if not more. My feelings for him were all over the place and what he did for me yesterday, with the dinner and the Christmas tree, meant something I couldn’t ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I also couldn’t ignore Blake. He was my friend, and after last night, I needed to make sure he didn’t expect anything more than that—a friendship. Because somewhere over the course of a day, even though I hadn’t figured out things with Daemon, I did realize that he was right about one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was using Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was uncomplicated and harmless. Totally a nice guy and dateable, but my feelings were lukewarm for the surfer. Nothing like how I felt for Daemon. And it wasn’t right. If Blake did like me, I couldn’t string him along anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I texted him back and said okay, hoping this wouldn’t be the most awkward dinner of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weather had changed the moment the sun went behind the mountains. The comfortable autumn air was replaced by near-frigid winds, and the sky took on a constant gloomy, overcast presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled into the closest parking space to the door of the diner. The wind had screamed the whole trip, and I dreaded getting out of my warm car. I couldn’t help but notice that the space of glass above the restaurant’s business hours held a picture of Simon on it. I grimaced, threw open the door, and hurried into the surprisingly crowded restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake was sitting near the fireplace. He stood and smiled when he saw me. “Hey, glad you made it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached out as if he wanted to hug me, I pretended not to notice and sat. “I can’t believe how cold it is. How was your trip?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning slightly, he took his seat and methodically straightened his silverware around a pretend plate. “It wasn’t bad. Not very exciting.” When the cutlery was positioned just so, he glanced up. “How was your break?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not very different than yours.” I paused, recognizing a few kids from school. They were clustered together, drinking sodas and eating a large oven pizza. Chad—the boy Lesa was dating—waved at me and I waved back. “But I’m not ready for it to be over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe paused while a plump waitress took our orders. I got a soda and a basket of fries and he ordered soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hopefully this doesn’t end up all over me,” he joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed. Not likely, since Daemon wasn’t here…yet. “I really am sorry about all that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake tapped his straw off my hand before peeling the paper from around the plastic. “It’s not a big deal. Stuff happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, studying the steamed-over windows. He cleared his throat, frowning again as his eyes narrowed on a middle-aged man near the bar who was looking around nervously. “I think that guy’s about to skip out on his bill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh, really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded. “And he thinks he’s getting away with it. He has so many times before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn stunned silence, I watched the man take one last drink and stand without getting his check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone is always watching,” Blake added with a slight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple sitting behind the man, both in flannel shirts and well-worn jeans, were also watching the customer about to flee. The man leaned toward the woman, whispering something. Her heavy face twisted into a scowl, and she slammed her hand down on the table. “No-good bums, always thinking they can get a free meal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outburst caught the attention of the manager who was taking an order by the door. He turned to face the startled man. “Hey! Did you pay for that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stopped and fumbled in his pockets. He muttered an apology and hastily threw several crumpled bills on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snapped back to Blake. “Whoa, that was…uncanny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until the waitress returned with our order and left, my unease growing. “How did you know he was going to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake blew on his spoonful of vegetable soup. “A good guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze met mine. “It was just a lucky guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoubt bubbled up. Blake wasn’t an alien—at least I assumed he wasn’t, and none of the Luxen I knew could read minds or foresee anything, but that was just too weird. It could’ve been a lucky guess, but every instinct was telling me there was something more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-24.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
