It was conducted by General Bunker upon the American side, while one General Hill led the British.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On this memorable occasion the Americans managed to destroy a thousand or so of the enemy, and might have done better had their supply of bullets held out. These becoming exhausted the noble fellows fell back upon the brass buttons of 100their uniforms, which they fired at the British as long as there was a button left among them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The brave Bunker, when his stock of buttons gave out, bethought him of his false teeth. He removed them from his mouth, and with fire in his eye and a horse-pistol in his right hand, (holding on his buttonless uniform with his left,) he turned upon the enemy a galling fire of “store” teeth, and every one of them took effect, making sixteen of the red-coats bite the dust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In his official report of the battle which he sent to Congress the heroic man avers: that, if there had been a dentist handy to extract ’em, he would have sacrificed every dashed natural tooth in his head for the cause of Liberty.\n\u003cbr\u003e 101\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Portrait of Mr Bunker\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Portrait of Mr Hill\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bunker-Hill Monument\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 102As a reward for his heroic conduct, Congress had him measured for a new set of elegant silver-mounted molars, which it promised to present to him some day with an appropriate inscription.
