So, no, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be giving you this manuscript today. I think the world might need to hear about the true adventures of Philippe and Isabella.

Veronica White is dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him, prepared to laugh, but he was staring. Julia felt burned herself beneath his gaze, and her cheeks flushed. She felt bare, without any of the defenses she had spent years mastering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not really burning her, you know,\" Lance said. \"You\u0027re still her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no one can prove it,\" she said, praying it was true. He moved closer and said, \"I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, and things grew very quiet, the only sound the sparking of the fire. He grasped the loose pages of the manuscript. \"A real woman wrote this,\" he said. \"A person, not a made-up name and a black-and-white picture. It has your fingerprints all over it, Julia. You said that yourself. Don\u0027t pretend that Veronica\u0027s dead.\" He moved closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lance,\" she started, but the feel of his hands around her waist made her stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me I can kiss you,\" he said, moving his hands to the sides of her face. \"Tell me I can do this.

Her mind went from empty to overflowing. She got to her feet, almost stumbling under the weight of her own body. She knew she had to get away. She had to run. She had to flee this man before she dissolved completely and forgot her own name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her wrist. \"Stop, Julia,\" he said. \"Just stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop what?

But as she looked down at Lance, and at the last shreds of Veronica White that lay scattered around him like last fall\u0027s leaves, words failed her. She knew how quickly everything you know .can turn to ash. She couldn\u0027t meet his gaze. \"Goodnight,\" she said. She pulled away and started for the stairs. \"And thank you. For everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, Julia peeked down the stairs. She snuck into the kitchen, her sights set on a box of granola bars and a carton of orange juice, wondering how long she could survive on that alone, thinking she might grab some crackers while she was at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d made it to the pantry door when a voice cut through the early-morning stillness of the kitchen. \"I called New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia stopped dead in her tracks, frozen mid-creep, terrified of turning around.

What\u0027s wrong with me?\" she asked, stalling while she thought, What is wrong with me? \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s wrong with me. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone began to ring.

Even Nina would have approved of the beautiful-yet-comfortable chairs. But no matter how lavish its furnishings, the place still smelled like death. She wondered if Lance could smell it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they got into an elevator and waited for the doors to close, Lance pushed the button for the eighth floor, then eased his arm around Julia\u0027s shoulders. The weight of his arm felt good, so she sank into him, grateful for someone to lean on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s going to take a lot more than a fall to hurt Ro-Ro,\" Lance said, as if he knew she needed to hear it. But Julia couldn\u0027t forget the tone of her mother\u0027s voice on the phone. She\u0027d had sixty miles to process, sixty miles to think but standing in that elevator with Lance\u0027s arm around her shoulders, Julia still struggled with the realization that the impossible had happened—that Ro-Ro, after all, was human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fitzgerald was husband number ...\" Lance prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four,\" Julia answered. \"The doctor-slash-medical-researcher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance nodded as if it was something he had known but forgotten. \"So, what does a twenty-million-dollar donation buy you in health care today, besides the chance to wield those really big scissors at the ribbon-cutting ceremony?\" he asked, and Julia had to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors opened and she said, \"I guess we\u0027ll find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started down the hall but couldn\u0027t see any uniformed footmen standing outside room 862 to take coats and introduce guests. There wasn\u0027t a gold placard on the wall, proclaiming that to be the Fitzgerald Suite. In fact, when Julia peeked inside, all she saw was an ordinary hospital room, complete with bad linens, uncomfortable chairs, and a plastic water pitcher on the bedside table. When they entered the room, it was so dim that Julia could barely see the frail woman beneath the sheets, covered with IV tubes and hospital bracelets and, of course, the four largest diamonds Julia had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Aunt Rosemary,\" she whispered, half out of respect and somber purpose, half out of nerves. \"How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think I\u0027m feeling?\" the old woman snapped, and with that, Julia\u0027s fears subsided. Ro-Ro feels like bitching— all is right with the world! \"They brought me here in that horrible contraption with all those lights and sirens. They woke up the neighbors. The whole building saw me carried out like an invalid! I\u0027ll never be able to show my face there again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Georgia will be glad to hear it, Julia thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inched closer to the bed and looked at the massive cast that surrounded Ro-Ro\u0027s left leg. She wanted to ask her if it hurt, or take the felt-tip pen she kept in her bag for autographing books and sign Ro-Ro\u0027s pristine bandages. But before she could do any such thing, Ro-Ro looked behind Julia and spoke to Lance. \"You\u0027re still here I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance inched forward and said, \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m here for a little while longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Ro-Ro dismissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia looked between Lance and Ro-Ro and wondered why her aunt would say such a thing. Then Julia\u0027s mother came floating into the room and whispered, \"They have her on d-r-u-g-s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I broke my leg, not my ears, Madelyn,\" Ro-Ro lorded over them from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyn ignored her like a pro. She hugged Lance and crooned, \"Oh, I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here.\" Then she swept toward her aunt and eldest daughter. \"Julia, dear, thank you so much for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia\u0027s blood went cold—Madelyn was using her \"death voice\"—the one she used while thanking someone for a Bundt cake and telling them when the funeral would be. Julia looked at Ro-Ro, so tiny on the bed, so frail, and she pulled her mother out into the hallway. \"What\u0027s really wrong with her?\" she asked once they\u0027d closed the door behind them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-26.html","bookId":2751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM"}
