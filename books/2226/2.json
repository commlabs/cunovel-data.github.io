Marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up from their canopy bed, she knew he was the one. Forever. As she stared into his deep-green eyes, somewhere in the distance a deafening bell began to ring. It was pulling him away. She reached for him, but her arms clutched empty air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the sound of the phone that fully awoke Susan Fletcher from her dream. She gasped, sat up in bed, and fumbled for the receiver. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan, it\u0027s David. Did I wake you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, rolling over in bed. \"I was just dreaming of you. Come over and play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"It\u0027s still dark out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\" She moaned sensuously. \"Then definitely come over and play. We can sleep in before we head north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid let out a frustrated sigh. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m calling. It\u0027s about our trip. I\u0027ve got to postpone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan was suddenly wide awake. \"What!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ve got to leave town. I\u0027ll be back by tomorrow. We can head up first thing in the morning. We\u0027ll still have two days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I made reservations,\" Susan said, hurt. \"I got our old room at Stone Manor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight was supposed to be special-to celebrate six months. You do remember we\u0027re engaged, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan.\" He sighed. \"I really can\u0027t go into it now, they\u0027ve got a car waiting. I\u0027ll call you from the plane and explain everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plane?\" she repeated. \"What\u0027s going on? Why would the university...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the university. I\u0027ll phone and explain later. I\u0027ve really got to go; they\u0027re calling for me. I\u0027ll be in touch. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David!\" she cried. \"What\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. David had hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Fletcher lay awake for hours waiting for him to call back. The phone never rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that afternoon Susan sat dejected in the tub. She submerged herself in the soapy water and tried to forget Stone Manor and the Smoky Mountains. Where could he be? she wondered. Why hasn\u0027t he called?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually the water around her went from hot to lukewarm and finally to cold. She was about to get out when her cordless phone buzzed to life. Susan bolted upright, sloshing water on the floor as she grappled for the receiver she\u0027d left on the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Strathmore,\" the voice replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan slumped. \"Oh.\" She was unable to hide her disappointment. \"Good afternoon, Commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoping for a younger man?\" The voice chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" Susan said, embarrassed. \"It\u0027s not how it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it is.\" He laughed. \"David Becker\u0027s a good man. Don\u0027t ever lose him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander\u0027s voice turned suddenly stern. \"Susan, I\u0027m calling because I need you in here. Pronto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to focus. \"It\u0027s Saturday, sir. We don\u0027t usually-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said calmly. \"It\u0027s an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan sat up. Emergency? She had never heard the word cross Commander Strathmore\u0027s lips. An emergency? In Crypto? She couldn\u0027t imagine. \"Y-yes, sir.\" She paused. \"I\u0027ll be there as soon as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it sooner.\" Strathmore hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Fletcher stood wrapped in a towel and dripped on the neatly folded clothes she\u0027d set out the night before-hiking shorts, a sweater for the cool mountain evenings, and the new lingerie she\u0027d bought for the nights. Depressed, she went to her closet for a clean blouse and skirt. An emergency? In Crypto?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she went downstairs, Susan wondered how the day could get much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to find out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-2.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM"}
