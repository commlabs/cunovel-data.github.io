They get into cars when they\u0027re drunk, when they\u0027re tired - without a second thought. But these same people are panicked at the thought of getting on an airplane. And the reason,\" Casey said,\"is that television consistently exaggerates the real dangers involved. That tape will make people afraid to fly. And for no good reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think the tape shouldn\u0027t have been shown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said it will make people afraid - for no good reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it your view tapes such as these should not be shown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought: Where is he going?

She had to plan her next move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon was smirking, a patronizing smile.

He had gotten her unguarded, off-balance reaction. She knew it would look bad. She knew there was no way for her to recover from it, no matter what she said from this point on. But she was focused on the paper in front of her, stunned to see it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a Xerox of the cover sheet of a report done three years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRIVILEGED INFORMATION - FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNORTON AIRCRAFT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINTERNAL REVIEW ACTION COMMITTEE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNSTABLE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF N-22 AIRCRAFT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd following was a list of the names of the committee members. Beginning with her name, since she had chaired the committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey knew that there was nothing improper about the study, nothing improper in its findings. But everything about it, even the name - \"Unstable Flight Characteristics\" -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;appeared damning.

It should never have been released. It was three years old - not that many people would even remember it existed. How had Reardon gotten it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the top of the page, saw a fax number, and the name of the sending station: NORTON QA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had come from her own office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho had done it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichman, she thought, grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichman had placed this report in the packet of press material on her desk.

The picture of reason. \"By all means, Ms. Singleton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me explain. This study was carried out to determine whether the N-22 had a stability problem.

But almost immediately he recovered. \u0027To be continued,\" he said, smiling at Casey. He was relaxed; he knew he had beaten her. He got up from his chair, turned his back to her. The big lights clicked off; the room seemed suddenly almost dark. Somebody turned the air-conditioning back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey got up, too. She pulled the radio mike off her waist. The makeup woman came running over to her, holding out a powder puff.

It\u0027ll take him ten minutes with the Board. Because we\u0027ve made a much bigger deal with Korea. A hundred and ten aircraft firm, and an option on thirty-five more. Sixteen billion dollars. The Board will be thrilled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Korea,\" Casey said. She was trying to put it together. Because it was a huge order, the biggest in the history of the company. \"But why would - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he gave them the wing,\" Richman said. \"And in return, they\u0027re more than happy to buy a hundred and ten aircraft. They don\u0027t care about sensationalistic American press. They know the plane\u0027s safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s giving them the wing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. It\u0027s a killer deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Casey said. \"It kills the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Global economy,\" Richman said. \"Get with the program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re gutting the company,\" she said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen billion dollars,\" Richman said. \"The minute that\u0027s announced, Norton stock\u0027ll go through the roof. Everybody gets well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody but the people in the company, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a done deal,\" Richman said. \"All we needed was somebody to publicly trash the N-22. And you just did that for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey sighed. Her shoulders dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking past Richman, she saw herself in the mirror. Makeup was pancaked around her neck, and now it was cracking. Her eyes were dark. She looked haggard, exhausted. Defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I suggest,\" Richman said, \"that you ask me, very politely, what you should do next. Because your only choice now is to follow orders. Do as you\u0027re told, be a good girl, and maybe John will give you severance. Say, three months. Otherwise, you\u0027re out on your fucking ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned close to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m waiting. Ask politely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her exhaustion, her mind raced, examining the options, trying to see a way out But she could see no way out. Newsline would run the story. Marder\u0027s plan would succeed. She was defeated. She had been defeated from the very beginning. Defeated from the first day Richman had shown up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still waiting,\" Richman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at his smooth face, smelled his cologne. The little bastard was enjoying this. And in a moment of fury, of deep outrage, she suddenly saw another possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning, she had tried so hard to do the right thing, to solve the problem of 545. She had been honest, she had been straight, and it had just gotten her into trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to face facts, here,\" Richman said. \"It\u0027s over. There\u0027s nothing you can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed away from the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she walked out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAR ROOM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:15P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey slipped into her seat. The soundman came over and clipped the radio pack to the waist of her dress. \"Say a few words for me, will you please? Just for level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Testing, testing, I\u0027m getting tired,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw Richman slip into the room, and stand with his back to the far wall. He had a faint smile on his face. He didn\u0027t look worried. He was confident there was nothing she could do. Marder had made a huge deal, he was shipping the wing, he was gutting the company, and he\u0027d used Casey to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon dropped into his seat opposite her, shrugged his shoulders, adjusted his tie. He smiled at her. \"How you holding up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot in here, isn\u0027t it?\" he said. He glanced at his watch. \"We\u0027re almost finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone came over, and whispered in Reardon\u0027s ear. The whispering continued for some time. Reardon said, \"Really?\" and his eyebrows went up, then he nodded several times. Finally he said, \"Got it.\" He began to shuffle his papers, going through the folder in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone said, \"Guys? We ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\u0027A camera ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B camera ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sound ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll tape,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it Casey thought She took a deep breath, looked expectantly at Reardon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an executive at Norton Aircraft\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been here five years.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-22.html","bookId":2409,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM"}
