HERBERT\u0027S GOOD LUCK.","content":"\u0026nbsp;“Good-morning,” said the young man, pleasantly. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good-morning,” answered Herbert, politely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He recognized the young man, though he had never seen him before, as a visitor from the city, who was boarding at the hotel, if the village tavern could be so designated. He seemed to be a studious young man, for he always had a book in his hand. He had a pleasant face, but was pale and slender, and was evidently in poor health.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see you are going to try your luck at fishing,” said the young man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; I have nothing else to do, and that brings me here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I, too, have nothing else to do; but I judge from your appearance that you have not the same reason for being idle.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is that, sir?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Poor health.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir; I have never been troubled in that way.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are fortunate. Health is a blessing not to be overestimated. It is better than money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose it is, sir; but at present I think I should value a little money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you in want of it?” asked the young man, earnestly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; I have just lost my place in the post office.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I have seen you in the post office.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; my mother had charge of the office till two weeks since, when it was transferred to Mr. Graham. He employed me to attend to the duties, and serve the customers in the store, till Saturday night, when I was succeeded by his son, who had just returned from the city.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your mother is a widow, is she not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know where you live; I have had it pointed out to me. Your father served in the war, did he not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; and the injuries he received hastened his death.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young man looked thoughtful. Then he said: “How much did Mr. Graham pay you for your services?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Three dollars a week.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That was not—excuse the question—all you and your mother had to depend upon, was it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not quite; mother receives a pension of eight dollars per month.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Five dollars a week altogether—that is very little.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is only two dollars now, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “True; but you have health and strength, and those will bring money. In one respect you are more fortunate than I. You have a mother—I have neither father nor mother.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m sorry for you, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you; anyone is to be pitied who has lost his parents. Now, as I have asked about your affairs, it is only fair that I should tell you about myself. To begin with, I am rich. Don\u0027t look envious, for there is something to counterbalance. I am of feeble constitution, and the doctors say that my lungs are affected. I have studied law, but the state of my health has obliged me to give up, for the present at least, the practice of my profession.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But if you are rich you do not need to practice,” said Herbert, who may be excused for still thinking his companion\u0027s lot a happy one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I do not need to practice my profession, so far as the earning of money is concerned; but I want something to occupy my mind. The doctors say I ought to take considerable out-door exercise; but I suppose my physical condition makes me indolent, for my chief exercise has been, thus far, to wander to the banks of the river and read under the trees.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That isn\u0027t very severe exercise,” said Herbert, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; still it keeps me out in the open air, and that is something. Now tell me, what are your plans?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My hope is to find something to do that will enable me to help mother; but there doesn\u0027t seem much chance of finding anything in Wayneboro. Do you think I could get a place in the city?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You might; but even if you did, you would find it difficult to earn your own living, and there would be no chance of your helping your mother.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert, though naturally sanguine and hopeful, looked sober. Just then he had a bite, and drew out a good-sized pickerel. This gave a new direction to his thoughts, and he exclaimed, triumphantly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look at this pickerel! He must weigh over two pounds.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All of that,” said the young man, rising and examining the fish with interest. “Let me use your pole, and see what luck I have.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young man, some ten minutes later, succeeded in catching a smaller pickerel, perhaps half the size of Herbert\u0027s.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That will do for me,” he said, “though it doesn\u0027t come up to your catch.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For two hours Herbert and his friend alternately used the pole, and the result was quite a handsome lot of fish.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You have more fish than you want,” said the young man. “You had better bring what you don\u0027t want to the hotel. I heard the landlord say he would like to buy some.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That would suit me,” said Herbert. “If he wants fish, I want money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come along with me, then. Really, I don\u0027t know when I have passed a forenoon so pleasantly. Usually I get tired of my own company, and the day seems long to me. I believe I see my way clear to a better way of spending my time. You say you want a place. How would you like me for an employer?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sure I should like you, but you are not in any business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” said the young man, smiling; “or, rather, my business is the pursuit of health and pleasure just now. In that I think you can help me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall be very glad to, if I can, Mr.—-”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My name is George Melville. Let me explain my idea to you. I want your company to relieve my solitude. In your company I shall have enterprise enough to go hunting and fishing, and follow out in good faith my doctor\u0027s directions. What do you say?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I would like that better than being in the post office,” he said. “It would seem like being paid for having a good time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much would you consider your services worth?” asked Mr. Melville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am content to leave that to you,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Suppose we say six dollars a week, then?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Six dollars a week!” exclaimed Herbert, amazed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Isn\u0027t that enough?” asked Melville, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is more than I can earn. Mr. Graham thought he was over-paying me with three dollars a week.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You will find me a different man from Mr. Graham, Herbert. I am aware that six dollars is larger pay than is generally given to boys of your age. But I can afford to pay it, and I have no doubt you will find the money useful.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It will quite set us on our feet again, Mr. Melville,” said Herbert, earnestly. “You are very generous.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, you don\u0027t know what a hard taskmaster you may find me,” said the young man, playfully. “By the way, I consider that you have already entered upon your duties. To-day is the first day. Now come to the hotel with me, and see what you can get for the fish. I happen to know that two of the guests, a lady and her daughter, are anxious for a good fish dinner and, as there is no market here, I think the landlord will be glad to buy from you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Melville was right. Mr. Barton, the landlord, purchased the fish that Herbert had to sell, for sixty cents, which he promptly paid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t that pay you for your morning\u0027s work?” asked Melville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know but the money ought to go to you, Mr. Melville,” said Herbert, “as I am now in your employ. Besides, you caught a part of them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I waive all claim to compensation,” said the young man, “though it would be a novel sensation to receive money for services rendered. What will you say, Herbert, when I tell you that I never earned a dollar in my life?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert looked incredulous.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is really true,” said George Melville, “my life has been passed at school and college, and I have never had occasion to work for money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are in luck, then.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know that; I think those who work for the money they receive are happy. Tell me, now, don\u0027t you feel more satisfaction in the sixty cents you have just been paid because you have earned it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought so. The happiest men are those who are usefully employed. Don\u0027t forget that, and never sigh for the opportunity to lead an idle life. But I suppose your dinner is ready. You may go home, and come back at three o\u0027clock.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert made good time going home. He was eager to tell his mother the good news of his engagement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962/81510.html","bookId":427,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:02:53 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:02:53 AM"}
