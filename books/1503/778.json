Almost instantaneously, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses felt as if they were facing six Heavenly Emperors at once.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA massive explosion. Five figures flew in all directions. Long Shiya had used his own strength to send the five Blood Red Hell powerhouses flying back, while he remained standing in his original position leisurely. Of course, the six illusory figures vanished as well, ‘sacrificed’ to accomplish this major victory.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePursing his lips, Long Shiya did not chase forward. “What bullshit Destruction Attribute, it isn’t much after all.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That’s not possible!” As Meng Gui was sent flying back, he couldn’t help but cry out in shock. Out of the six illusory figures that Long Shiya had summoned, two of them were used to take care of him, the Light and Water Attribute figures. Their powerful offensive strength seemed no lesser than Long Shiya himself, able to deal a single strike of his full power. As such, even though Meng Gui had attacked with his full power, boosted by the Destruction Attribute as he was, he had still been sent flying back, his vital energy and blood roiling within his body. More importantly, Meng Gui was not able to understand as Long Shiya’s attacks seemed to contain a strange energy and aura which was actually able to scatter his own Destruction Attribute, not allowing it to come into full effect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLong Shiya laughed heartily, saying: “Little Meng Gui, in this world, there is no such thing as impossible. It is merely you being short sighted.

Long Shiya was indeed of higher cultivation level, and his power was definitely considerable, especially with his six Attributes fusion, he did not really need to be too afraid of the Destruction Attribute. After all, once he fused his own six natural elemental attributes, even the four Saint Attributes could not suppress him. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing had infused his body with the true Astral Saint Energy. With its support, one could just imagine the sheer power that Long Shiya had just unleashed. In front of the Saint Energy, how could the Destruction Attribute release its full power?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003eAs such, even though the exchange was over in a split second, Long Shiya had been able to resolve the situation of being surrounded. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeng Gui’s plan had not been a bad one.

Originally, when he had defeated his father-in-law in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, although that was with some trickeries, most of the entire process was actually real. These Heavenly Kings were facing immense pressure from Long Shiya and were thus quite preoccupied, and thus his ambushes were easily successful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRays of dark gold light lit up in the darkness, and in the glow of the dark gold, a figure appeared slowly in the dark, wings spread behind his back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith no more chances left to sneak attack, Zhou Weiqing did not attempt to hide himself any longer, revealing his presence at once.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, his entire body was covered with a powerful looking armour, even his legs.

He could not tell what Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was, but looking at this seemingly young man in front of him nearly fully fitted out in a Legendary Set, it looked like his cultivation was not that far from Long Shiya! More importantly, that soundless and stirless attacks were just too terrifying.

Well, how is it, I bet you never imagined this right. A Heavenly King before the age of twenty three. Does your Blood Red Hell have anyone like this? Hahahaha.” Even at this point, Long Shiya did not forget to brag about his precious disciple. In truth, if it was anyone else who had a disciple like Zhou Weiqing, who wouldn’t be proud and brag about it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You are Zhou Weiqing?!” Meng Gui stared at Zhou Weiqing with a surprised and doubtful look. He had heard this name many times, mostly regarding his display in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Originally, Zhou Weiqing had been at a mere three-Jeweled stage when he first defeated Shen Little Demon, who had been at the six-Jeweled stage at that time, even leading the Fei Li Empire into gaining their first championship of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. More so, one year ago, he had once again joined the Heavenly Jewel Tournament and defeated the brothers Tian Feng and Tian Ma. It had to be known, in the Blood Red Hell, even though Meng Gui was a Heavenly Emperor, his actual status was still lower than the two brothers. They were after all the future heirs to the Blood Red Hell.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeng Gui also knew the reason why the Heavenly Bow Empire could even have a chance of revival was all because of this young man. However, he had never dreamed that in just a year, the originally seven-Jeweled Zhou Weiqing would actually appear in front of him as a Heavenly King. Such a cultivation speed, wasn’t it just too terrifying? Even though the current Blood Red Hell could be considered experts in grooming powerhouses, they could not possibly bring up a Heavenly King in such a short period of time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe brilliant light in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes flickered as he looked coldly at those powerhouses in front of him. Currently, he had entered a different state. The casual beautiful feeling he had when returning with Shangguan Bing’er had vanished, replaced with a billowing monstrous demonic aura. His entire body was filled with a demonic look.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was no wonder he was acting like this. These Blood Red Hell powerhouses in front of him wanted to deal with his home, his family! When he had first reached the palace and saw it covered with the Fate Denying Seal, his heart was aching so much that he almost couldn’t breathe. It was these bastards from the Bai Da Empire, Kalise Empire… they had invaded and destroyed his homeland, leaving his father with no choice but to use this near-suicidal method to protect the last Royal Family bloodlines. As such, against these enemies, how could he possibly show any mercy?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe first three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings had already been drained dry to death earlier. He had even Devoured the Heavenly God Tier Terror Sea Dragon previously, and he would naturally help himself easily on these mere Heavenly Kings. With the Astral Saint Core Nucleus, his Devour Skill had reached another level totally. Let alone Heavenly Kings, even if he was fighting against a Heavenly Emperor, he could still affect him to a certain degree with the Devour Skill.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn truth, when Zhou Weiqing had completed his Astral Saint Core Nucleus, he had already become an existence that could challenge the heavens. The greatest mistake of the Blood Red Hell was that they shouldn’t have given him the time and chance to grow at all. When he was below the Heavenly King stage, although Zhou Weiqing was still disgustingly monstrous, he was just much stronger than those of the same level, but there was still a limit. Alas, once he had broken through to the Heavenly King stage, fully grasping the Heavenly Dao Energy, even a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse would find it difficult to actually kill him off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter a short period of shock, Meng Gui slowly calmed down. Although he did not know what methods Zhou Weiqing had used to ambush his subordinates, when he saw that Zhou Weiqing was still at the Heavenly King stage, he gave a secret sigh of relief. If there were two Heavenly Emperors here, they would definitely have no chance at all. However, since Zhou Weiqing was only a Heavenly King, it would be a relatively easier problem to solve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“So what if both of you master and disciple have six Attributes? We have four people here. Even if the three of them can’t defeat you two, they can still hold you off for a short time. If you know what’s best for you, you better retreat now. Otherwise, this Fate Denying Seal will just take me a second to destroy. Once that happens, there won’t be anyone left alive inside.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Meng Gui spoke those words, he had joined up with his other three companions. Destroying was always easier than creating, and what he said was indeed true. As long as he was given some time, and he was willing to pay the price, he could easily destroy the Fate Denying Seal below them now. After which, any simple Skill of his would be able to wipe out all those within the Seal. After all, being in the Fate Denying Seal for so long, those inside would be extremely weak. This was especially so far Zhou Weiqing’s father, Admiral Zhou. It was close to certain that if the Seal was broken, he would instantly lose his life. After all, the Seal was built upon and dependant on his life force to maintain.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing walked slowly to the front in midair, as if there were actual steps in the air.
