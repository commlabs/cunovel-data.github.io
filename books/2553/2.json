Before heading for the bar, Patrick slipped Nabb a ten-dollar bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmstrong snatched it from the sim\u0027s fingers and handed it back to Patrick. \"No tipping sims. That\u0027s a no-no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always tip my caddie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s human, sure. But what\u0027s a sim gonna do with money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy candy bars, or maybe a bottle of Cuervo. Who cares?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better not. Holmes\u0027ll have a fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick knew all about Holmes Carter: club president and a notorious pain-in-the-ass stickler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick winked at Armstrong. \"You ever caddie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? Naw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course not, Patrick thought. You were probably getting private golf lessons instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. Right here, before anyone ever heard of sims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don\u0027t care if he\u0027s human, sim, or some kind of robot, Patrick thought, I willalways tip my caddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Armstrong turned toward the locker room, Patrick rolled up the bill and palmed it to Nabb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, they had a corner of the bar to themselves, and while they were talking and drinking -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Armstrong a Gibson up and Patrick a Rob Roy on the rocks - he had the odd feeling of being watched. But whenever he looked around he saw only the sims bustling about. The wait staff was human, but sims did all the bussing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick listened to Armstrong\u0027s idea about opening negotiations with the clerks by demanding a few choice give-backs from the full-timers\u0027 benefits package. Figured that would put them on the defensive. What an asshole. The idea sucked, truly and big time. Not because of the give-backs - nothing Patrick liked better than putting the screws to the opposition - but because the clerks\u0027 negotiator was a bitch on wheels who\u0027d take that kind of opening salvo personally. From there on negotiations would go straight downhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he said, \"The idea\u0027s got merit, Ben. Let me think on how to approach it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sense in miffing a deep-pocketed client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick ran a hand over the polished mahogany of the bar and looked around at the well-heeled members gathering in clusters on either side or filtering into the adjacent dining room. He wanted to belong here so bad it made his gut ache. Wander in whenever he damn well felt like it, set his foot on the brass rail, and hang with the high rollers, trolling, setting his hooks, reeling them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d already been turned down three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Armstrong was ordering another round, Patrick headed for the men\u0027s room. After he washed up, the white-coated sim attendant handed him a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May sim speak, Mist Sulliman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick glanced at him in the mirror. An older sim, touches of gray at his temples and above his large ears. Patrick had been here often enough to recognize him. His brass name tag read \"Tome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know my name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read you in paper, see play golf - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait-wait-wait. Read in paper? Sims can\u0027t read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This sim read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat jolted Patrick. The world was still trying to get used to talking animals, but reading - sims weren\u0027t smart enough. Or at least they weren\u0027t supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you learn to read?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taught self, sir,\" Tome said, puffing his chest. \"Not good, but can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick stared. \"This is amazing! Why haven\u0027t you told the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTome shook his head. \"Other sim name Groh learn read. Tell evyone. Mans come take way. Nev more see Groh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Who could that have been but SimGen? But why recall a reading sim? Unless it was to see how they could replicate the ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please not tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Mum\u0027s the word.\" But a reading sim...he shook his head in wonder. \"So what\u0027d you want to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mist Sulliman lawyer, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Patrick grinned. \"This isn\u0027t going to be a lawyer joke, is it? Don\u0027t tell me you do stand-up too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. You lawyer for union, is true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some days, yes; some days I\u0027m for management. Where\u0027s this going, Tome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sims been talking and...\" His voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatience nibbled at Patrick. Out there on the bar the ice in his drink was melting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And...\" The words rushed out: \"And sims want you start sim union.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick\u0027s jaw dropped - he was looking in the mirror when it swung down and he saw it hang open like a trapdoor. Slowly he turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sim union? Have you been nipping at the aftershave, Tome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have money,\" Tome said. \"Have saved. We give you make sim union.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute...wait a minute...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick suddenly had a wild thought. He looked around for a video camera. When he didn\u0027t see one, he checked the stalls - all empty. Laughing, he came back to Tome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA reading, AFL-CIO sim. Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, who put you up to it? Armstrong? Rogers? Come on, who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mist Sulliman. We know you. Want hire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould this cloned ape be serious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick sighed. \"Tome, you have no idea what you\u0027re saying. Unions are for people. Sims aren\u0027t people. That\u0027s the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yessir, but Mist Sulliman lawyer. Lawyer change law. You - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the door swung open and Holmes Carter waddled in. About Patrick\u0027s age - mid-thirties - but he looked older and had a commanding lead in the gut department. A bulbous forehead and no lips to speak of, and where Patrick\u0027s hair lay thick and fair, Carter\u0027s was dark and thinning; his scalp gleamed through his comb-over. Soon he\u0027d be a chrome dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe not. Looking at Carter\u0027s hair now, Patrick noticed that it was thicker; didn\u0027t appear to be a rug or a weave either. Must have gone and got himself a splice to replace his baldness gene. You ol\u0027 devil, you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad the genemeisters couldn\u0027t do anything to reduce his fat. Scalps were easy: a limited number of cells to splice. Fat was a whole other deal - trillions of fat cells in a body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut fat, thin, bald, or pompadoured, Carter would always be a first-class dork. No splice for that. But he was also third-generation Beacon Ridge and first in line to inherit the family\u0027s string of car dealerships. In his teens Patrick had caddied for the two preceding generations of Carters and they\u0027d been pretty decent. But Holmes...Holmes must have been fashioned from what had collected in the skimmers of their gene pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Patrick qualified for the club professionally and financially - at least on paper - he hadn\u0027t been able to squeak past the membership committee. The blackball rule was alive and well here, and he was pretty sure Holmes Carter had used it to keep him out. Probably couldn\u0027t tolerate the idea of a former caddy hobnobbing with the members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talking to yourself again, Sullivan?\" he said, baring his teeth in what passed for a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might not believe this, Holmes, but Tome and I were just...\" Patrick noticed a sudden fearful widening of the sim\u0027s eyes \"...having a little chitchat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter swung on Tome. \"You know the rules! No talking to people - even if it\u0027s a nonmember. You are to be barely seen andnever heard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yessir,\" Tome said. He turned away and hung his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick spotted the ID number and bar code tattooed on the nape of the sim\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lighten up, Holmesy,\" he said, then eyed the man\u0027s gut. \"In more ways than one. What\u0027s he supposed to do when I talk to him? Ignore me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter bellied up to the urinal. \"If it\u0027s you, yes. What\u0027s the matter? Can\u0027t get any people to listen to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I like sims better than some people I know - present company included.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter had that shark grin again as he returned from the urinal and began rinsing his hands. \"You never learn, do you, Sullivan. Why do I keep seeing you around here? When are you going to quit cadging rounds of golf from our members and bamboozling them into sponsoring you? Didn\u0027t you get the message when the committee turned you down? You\u0027re not wanted around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stung. But Patrick hid the hurt and said nothing, simply stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Carter said as he dried his hands. \"Cat gotcher tongue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Patrick said. \"Just wondering why you sprang for a hair splice and passed up one for a personality.\" Figuring he didn\u0027t have to worry about burning nonexistent bridges, he added: \"Also wondering why I\u0027m standing here listening to a used car salesman - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027renot used!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - who has to use a homing pigeon to get his belt around his waist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter\u0027s pie face reddened toward cherry. \"You think you\u0027re funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no Bill Hicks, but I have my moments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it up, Sullivan. I hear you tipped a caddie today. Just keep it up and I\u0027ll have you banned from the grounds, so no matter how many friends you have here, you\u0027ll never step on our course again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw his towelette at Tome and stormed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick waited for the door to close, then turned to Tome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you get off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Club close ten,\" Tome said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll meet you then. You may have found yourself a lawyer.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-2.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
