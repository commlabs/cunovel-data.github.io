She held her breath as she stirred the nest of tattered cloth with the toe of one boot. She could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eread the story of this collection of garbage as easily as if the inhabitant had written out a full confession,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esigned it, and posted it on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne vampire. A rogue, an outcast who lived on the fringe of both the human world and the Night World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probably moved to anew city every few weeks to avoid getting caught. And he undoubtedly looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike any other homeless guy, except that none of the human homeless would be hanging around aBoston\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edock on a Tuesday night in early March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brings his victims here, Rashel thought. The pier\u0027s deserted, it\u0027s private, he can take his time with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. And of course he can\u0027t resist keeping a few trophies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer foot stirred them gently. A pink-and-blue knit baby jacket, a plaid sash from a school uniform, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpiderman tennis shoe. All bloodstained. All very small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been a rash of missing children lately. TheBoston police would never discover where they had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egone-but now Rashel knew. She felt her lips draw back slightly from her teeth in something that wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was aware of everything around her: the soft plash of water against the wooden pier, the rank\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoppery smell that was almost a taste, the darkness of a night lit only by a half moon. Even the light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoisture of the cold breeze against her skin. She was aware of all of it without being preoccupied with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany of it-and when the tiny scratch sounded behind her, she moved as smoothly and gracefully as if she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere taking her turn in a dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pivoted on her left foot, drawing her bokken in the same motion, and without a break in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emovement, she stabbed straight to the vampire\u0027s chest. She drove the blow from her hips, exhaling in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehiss as she did it, putting all her strength behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta be faster than that,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire, skewered like a hot dog, waved his arms and gibbered. He was dressed in filthy clothing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand his hair was a bushy tangle. His eyes were wide, full of surprise and hatred, shining as silver as an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanimal\u0027s in the faint light. His teeth weren\u0027t so much fangs as tusks: fully extended, they reached almost to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Rashel said. \"You really, really wanted to kill me. Life\u0027s tough, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire snarled one more time and then the silver went out of his eyes, leaving only the look of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eastonishment. His body stiffened and slumped backward. It lay still on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrimacing, Rashel pulled her wooden sword out of the chest. She started to wipe the blade on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire\u0027s pants, then hesitated, peering at them more closely. Yes, those were definitely little crawly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings. And the blankets were just as repulsive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, well. Use your own jeans. It won\u0027t be the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe carefully wiped the bokken clean. It was two and a half feet long and just slightly, gracefully curved,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith a narrow, sharp, angled tip. Designed to penetrate a body as efficiently as possible-if that body was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esusceptible to wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword slipped back into its sheath with a papery whisper. Then Rashel glanced at the body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Vampire was already going mummified. His skin was now yellow and tough; his staring eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edried up, his lips shrunken, his tusks collapsed. Rashel bent over him, reaching into her back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she pulled out looked like the snapped-off end of a bamboo backscratcher-which was exactly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat it was. She\u0027d had it for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery precisely, Rashel drew the five lacquered fingers of the scratcher down the vampire\u0027s forehead. On\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe yellow skin five brown marks appeared, like the marks of a cat\u0027s claws. Vampire skin was easy to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emark tight after death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This kitten has claws,\" she murmured. It was a ritual sentence; she\u0027d repeated it ever since the night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d killed her first vampire at the age of twelve. In memory of her mother, who\u0027d always called her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekitten. In memory of herself at age five, and all the innocence she\u0027d lost. She\u0027d never be a helpless kitten again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, it was a little joke. Vampires... bats. Herself... a cat. Anybody who\u0027d grown up with Batman\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Catwoman would get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. All done. Whistling softly, she rolled the body over and over with her foot to the end of the pier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t feel like carting the mummy all the way out to the fens, the salt marshes where bodies were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etraditionally left inBoston . With a mental apology to everybody who was trying to clean up the harbor,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe gave the corpse a final push and listened for the splash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still whistling as she emerged from the pier onto the street. Hi-ho, hi-ho, it\u0027s off to work we go---\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in a very good mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only disappointment was the constant one, that it hadn\u0027t been the vampire, the one she\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooking for ever since she\u0027d been five years old. It had been a rogue, all right-a depraved monster\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho killed human kids foolishly close to human habitations. But it hadn\u0027t been the rogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel would never forget his face. And she knew that someday she would see it again. Meanwhile,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was nothing to do but shish-kebab as many of the parasites as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned the streets as she walked, alert for any sign of Night People. All she saw were quiet brick\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuildings and streetlights shining pale gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was a shame, because she was in terrific form tonight; she could feel it. She was every\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebloodsucking leech\u0027s worst enemy. She could stake six of them before breakfast and still be fresh for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echemistry first period at Wassaguscus High.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stopped suddenly, absent-mindedly melting into a shadow as a police car cruised silently down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe cross-street ahead. I know, she thought. I\u0027ll go see what the Lancers are up to. If anybody knows\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere vampires are, they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe headed for the North End. Half an hour later she was standing in front of a brownstone apartment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuilding, ringing the buzzer. \"Who\u0027s there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, Rashel said, \"The night has a thousand eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the day only one,\" came the reply from the intercom. \"Hey there, girl. Come on up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, Rashel climbed a dark and narrow stairway to a scarred wooden door. There was a peephole in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe door. Rashel faced it squarely, then pulled off the scarf she\u0027d been wearing. It was black, silky, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every long. She wore it wrapped around her head and face like a veil, so that only her eyes showed, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven they were in shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook out her hair, knowing what the person on the other side could see. A tall girl dressed like a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eninja, all hi black, with black hair falling loose around her shoulders and green eyes blazing. She hadn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echanged much since she was five, except in height. Right now she made a barbaric face at the peephole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand heard the sound of laughter behind the door as bolts were drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited until the door was shut behind her again before she said, \"Hi, Elliot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElliot was a few years older than she was, and thin, with intense eyes and little shiny glasses that were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealways slipping off his nose. Some people would have dismissed him as a geek. But Rashel had once\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseen him stand up to two werewolves while she got a human girl out a window, and she knew that he had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epractically single-handedly started the Lancers-one of the most successful organizations of vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunters on the east coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up, Rashel? It\u0027s been a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been busy. But now I\u0027m bored. I came to see if you guys had anything going.\" As Rashel spoke,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was looking at the other people in the room. A brown-haired girl was kneeling, loading objects from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboxes into a dark green backpack. Another girl and a boy were sitting on the couch. Rashel recognized\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe boy from other Lancers meetings, but neither of the girls were familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky you,\" Elliot said. \"This is Vicky, my new second-in-command.\" He nodded at the girl on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloor. \"She just moved toBoston ; she was the leader of a group on the south shore. And tonight she\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etaking a little expedition out to some warehouses in Mission Hill. We got a lead that there\u0027s been some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eactivity out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of activity? Leeches, puppies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElliot shrugged. \"Vampires definitely. Werewolves maybe. There\u0027s been a rumor about teenage girls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egetting kidnapped and stashed somewhere around there. The problem is we don\u0027t know exactly where,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor why.\" He tilted his head, his eyes twinkling. \"You want to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t anybody going to ask me?\" Vicky said, straightening up from her backpack. Her pale blue eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere fixed on Rashel. \"I\u0027ve never even seen this girl before. She could be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElliot pushed his glasses higher on his nose. He looked amused. \"You wouldn\u0027t say that if you knew,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky. Rashel\u0027s the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At everything. When you were going to your fancy prep school, she was out in theChicago slums\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estaking vampires. She\u0027s been inL.A. ,New York ,New Orleans... even Vegas. She\u0027s wiped out more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparasites than the rest of us put together.\" Elliot glanced mischievously at Rashel, then leaned toward Vicki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever heard of the Cat?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s head snapped up. She stared at Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Cat? The one all the Night People are afraid of? The one they\u0027re offering a reward for? The one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho leaves a mark-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel shot Elliot a warning look. \"Never mind,\" she said. She wasn\u0027t sure she trusted these new people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky was right about one thing: you couldn\u0027t be too careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she didn\u0027t like Vicky much, but she could hardly turn down such a good opportunity for vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunting. Not tonight, when she was in such terrific form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go with you-if you\u0027ll have me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky\u0027s pale blue eyes bored into Rashel\u0027s a moment, then she nodded. \"Just remember I\u0027m in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Rashel murmured. She could see Elliot\u0027s grin out of the corner of her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Steve, and that\u0027s Nyala.\" Elliot indicated the boy and girl on the couch. Steve had blond hair,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuscular shoulders, and a steady expression; Nyala had skin like cocoa and a faraway look in her eyes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas if she were sleepwalking. \"Nyala\u0027s new. She just lost her sister a month ago,\" Elliot added in a gentle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoice. He didn\u0027t need to say how the sister had been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel nodded at the girl. She sympathized. There was nothing quite like the shock of first discovering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Night World, when you realized that things like vampires and witches and werewolves were real, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat they were everywhere, joined in one giant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecret organization. That anybody could be one, and you\u0027d never know until it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody ready? Then let\u0027s go,\" Vicky said, and Steve and Nyala got up. Elliot showed them to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Vicky led the way to a dark blue car with mud strategically caked on the license plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll drive to the warehouse area,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel was relieved. She was used to walking the city streets at night without being seen-important when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou were carrying a rather unconcealable sword-but she wasn\u0027t sure that these other three could manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive was silent except for the murmur of Steve\u0027s voice occasionally helping Vicky with directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through respectable neighborhoods and venerable areas with handsome old buildings until\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey got to a street where everything changed suddenly. All at once, as if they had crossed some invisible\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edividing line, the gutters were full of soggy trash and the fences were topped with razor wire. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuildings were government housing projects, dark warehouses, or rowdy bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky pulled into a parking lot and stopped the car away from the security lights. Then she led them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the knee-high dead weeds of a vacant lot to a street that was poorly lighted and utterly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the observation post,\" Vicky whispered, as they reached a squat brick building, a part of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehousing project that had been abandoned. Following her, they zigzagged through debris and scrap metal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto get to a side door, and then they climbed a dark staircase covered with graffiti to the third floor. Their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflashlights provided the only illumination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice place,\" Nyala whispered, looking around. She had obviously never seen anything like it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think-there may be other people here besides vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve gave her a reassuring pat. \"No, it\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it looks like even the junkies have abandoned it,\" Rashel said, grimly amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can see the whole street from the window,\" Vicky put in shortly. \"Elliot and I were here yesterday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatching those warehouses across the street. And last night we saw a guy at the end of the street who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked a lot like a vampire. You know the signs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNyala opened her mouth as if to say she didn\u0027t know the signs, but Rashel was already speaking. \"Did\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou test him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t want to get that close. We\u0027ll do it tonight if he shows up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you test them?\" Nyala asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky didn\u0027t answer. She and Steve had pushed aside a couple of rat-chewed mattresses and were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunloading the bags and backpacks they\u0027d brought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel said, \"One way is to shine a flashlight in their eyes. Usually you get eye-shine back-like an animal\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are other ways, too,\" Vicky said, setting the things she was unloading on the bare boards of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloor. There were ski masks, knives made of both metal and wood, a number of stakes of various sizes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand a mallet. Steve added two clubs made of white oak to the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wood hurts them more than metal,\" Vicky said to Nyala. \"If you cut them with a steel knife they heal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright before your eyes-but cut them with wood and they keep bleeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel didn\u0027t quite like the way she said it. And she didn\u0027t like the last thing Vicky was pulling out of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebackpack. It was a wooden device that looked a bit like a miniature stock. Two hinged blocks of wood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat fit snugly around a person\u0027s wrists and closed with a lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampire handcuffs,\" Vicky said proudly, seeing her look. \"Made of white oak. Guaranteed to hold any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparasite. I brought them from down south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But hold them for what? And what do you need all those little knives and stakes for? It would take\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehours to kill a vampire with those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky smiled fiercely. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Rashel\u0027s heart seemed to thump and then sink, and she looked away to control her reaction. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstood what Vicky had in mind now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A quick death\u0027s too good for them,\" Vicky said, still smiling. \"They deserve to suffer-the way they make\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eour people suffer. Besides, we might get some information. We need to know where they\u0027re keeping the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirls they kidnap, and what they\u0027re doing with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicky.\" Rashel spoke earnestly. \"It\u0027s practically impossible to make vampires talk. They\u0027re stubborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they\u0027re hurt they just get angry-like animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky smirked. \"I\u0027ve made some talk. It just depends on what you do, and how long you make it last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, there\u0027s no harm in trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Elliot know about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky lifted a shoulder defensively. \"Elliot lets me do things my way. I don\u0027t have to tell him every little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edetail. I was a leader myself, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelplessly, Rashel looked at Nyala and Steve. And saw that for the first time Nyala\u0027s eyes had lost their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esleepwalking expression. Now she looked awake- and savagely glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"We should try to make the vampire talk. And if he suffers-well, my sister suffered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I found her, she was almost dead but she could still talk. She told me what it felt like, having all the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblood drained out of her body while she was still conscious. She said it hurt. She said...\" Nyala\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopped, swallowed, and looked at Vicky. \"I want to help do it,\" she said thickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve didn\u0027t say anything, but then from what Rashel knew of him, that was typical. He was a guy of few\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewords. Anyway, he didn\u0027t protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel felt odd, as if she were seeing the very worst of herself reflected in a mirror. It made her...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eashamed. It left her shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who am I to judge? she thought, turning away. It\u0027s true that the parasites are evil, all of them. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhole race needs to be wiped out. And Vicky\u0027s right, why should they have a clean death, when they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eusually don\u0027t give their victims one? Nyala deserves to avenge her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you object or something,\" Vicky said heavily, and Rashel could feel those pale blue eyes on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027re some kind of vampire sympathizer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel might have laughed at that, but she wasn\u0027t in a laughing mood. She took a breath, then said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout turning around, \"It\u0027s your show. I agreed that you were in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Vicky said, and returned to her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sick feeling in the pit of Rashel\u0027s stomach didn\u0027t go away. She almost hoped that the vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewouldn\u0027t come. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-3.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
