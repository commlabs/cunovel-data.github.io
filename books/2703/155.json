Like, she’s a drug addict?” Noel asked, just as boggled as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen glanced at both of us. “She has kidney failure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed up a step, not expecting to hear that at all. Actually, it was probably one of the very last things I was imagining. I had known something was going on with her health-wise, but I’d been thinking more along the same lines as Noel, that she’d been doing something to herself to provoke an illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But...she can’t...what?” I backed up a couple more steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a solemn nod, Ten kept talking. “She’s bad enough along that she needs dialysis three times a week to keep going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“End stage,” I murmured. Shaking my head, I sank down until I was sitting on the sofa. “That’s just... That’s not even possible. I would know. How could I not know something like that? And w-w-why would she...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had known something was going on with her, that she was keeping things from me. Covering my mouth with my hand, I looked up at my roommate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why wouldn’t she say anything?” I think the fact that she’d kept this from me was more of an insult than realizing she’d cheated on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen sighed and ran his hand through his hair. “I guess it takes a really selfish person to understand why she’d want to keep that silent, but I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, please,” I barked, “Explain it to me.” Because I didn’t get it at all. I didn’t get any of this. The Cora Wilder I had started dating months ago was nothing at all like the Cora Wilder I was learning truly existed. How had she been able to hide this side of herself for so long? And why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSociopath, I reminded myself. But a sociopath with kidney failure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped my head with both hands, because oh yeah, my temples were throbbing like crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sickness and disease is gross,” Ten said. “Stupid, careless people like me, like Whora, look at people with cancer and terminal illness with revulsion. They’re weak and repugnant and should be hidden away from society. To learn she’s one of them...” He laughed and shook his head, “She’s in denial, man. She doesn’t want people to know she’s not perfect. She wants to stay the fucking queen bee. She can’t have a flaw, or no one will follow her. So she hides it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even from me?” I had to ask. I felt sick to my stomach. Ten might’ve classified himself in that same category with her, but I knew he didn’t belong. He didn’t really see others that way, no matter how much he wanted us to think he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSympathy filled his eyes, letting me know just how right I was. Cora wouldn’t have been sympathetic right then. But Ten was. “Especially from you,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and blew out a breath. “And Zoey?” I asked, my voice going hoarse because thinking about her keeping this from me hurt worse than knowing Cora had. And I knew she had to have known about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to donate one of her kidneys for the transplant,” Ten answered quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I bowed my head. “Of course she is.” I wouldn’t have expected anything less from her. And wow, now that I thought of it, that was why Cora had brought her here. I was sure Zoey had willingly volunteered the transplant; she probably thought it’d been her idea entirely. But Cora had orchestrated the whole thing because she knew Zoey, and she knew what Zoey would offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had Cora phrased it? Zoey will do anything for me, because I’m like, I don’t know, her god, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything made so much sense now. All the times Zoey had been so guilty around me, unable to divulge Cora’s secret, knowing it would probably impact my relationship with her, because let’s face it...if I’d known Cora was going through what she was going through, I never would’ve dumped her, faithless whore or not. It just wasn’t in my chemical makeup to be that cruel. And Zoey had known that, because she would’ve done the same exact thing if she’d been in my shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora had been right; Zoey and I were the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three guys watching me warily jumped as if they expected me to start raging and tearing the room apart or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what’re you going to do?” Noel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going over there and getting Zoey’s things out of that apartment. She might be donating Cora a kidney, but that doesn’t mean she has to live with her another day. I’m getting her as far away from that crazy, lying bitch as possible.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-155.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
