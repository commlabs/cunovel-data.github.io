We can make out a case without it, but with this our case will be complete.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t it be difficult to find out, Mr. Novarro?\" asked Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Difficult, but not impossible. To begin with, I know the date of probable transfer. Next, I know the securities. By visiting the offices of different brokers I may obtain some information. At any rate, I have mapped out my plan of procedure, and hope within a week to obtain a clew.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [306]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben asked no questions, feeling that he could safely leave the whole matter in the hands of so experienced a business man as his new guardian.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They did not go to a hotel, but to a boarding-house kept by a Cuban lady, a friend of his guardian, which they found quite as comfortable and more homelike than the Metropolitan or the Windsor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile Ben thought it best not to make a call at the office of his uncle. Indeed, remembering the cruel way in which he had wronged his mother, he would have found it disagreeable to meet him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But one day, on Broadway, he met his cousin, Clarence Plantagenet. He would have avoided the encounter, but it was too late, for Clarence had seen him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What! Ben!\" he exclaimed. \"I had no idea you were back in New York. When did you arrive?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Three days since,\" answered Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where are you staying?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At a boarding-house in Forty-second street.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [307]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How is Major Grafton?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know; I am no longer with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What!\" exclaimed Clarence, pricking up his ears. \"You are no longer in his employ?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where is he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I left him in Europe.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did he discharge you for?\" asked Clarence, cheerfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He didn\u0027t discharge me. He was opposed to my leaving him, but we couldn\u0027t agree.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think you are a fool!\" said Clarence, bluntly. \"With him you could live like a gentleman. You haven\u0027t got another place, have you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you won\u0027t get one very soon, I can tell you that, except as a boy at three or four dollars a week.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can look round, at any rate,\" he answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s all the good it\u0027ll do. You mustn\u0027t expect my father to help you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [308]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t. If I had, I should have called before this.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"After throwing up a good place, if you were not discharged, you don\u0027t deserve help.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am not sure that I shall look for another place,\" said Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are not?\" asked Clarence, mystified.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I may go to school a little longer. I haven\u0027t as good an education as I should like.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But how are you going to live while you are doing all this?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you think your father would give me a home in his family and let me attend school in the city?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Ben Baker, you have got cheek, I declare! If that is what you are counting on, you may as well give it up.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s as well to know the worst,\" said Ben, tranquilly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall have to be going along,\" said Clarence, coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He told his father at dinner about his meeting with Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what, father,\" he said. \"I couldn\u0027t account at first for Ben\u0027s seeming so [309] cool and independent. I think I understand it now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, suppose you explain, then.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think he\u0027s robbed Major Grafton of a sum of money and taken French leave. He said he was not \u0027bounced\u0027 and that the major did not want him to leave.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you are wrong, my son. I haven\u0027t the highest opinion of your cousin, but I earnestly hope he is honest. To have him guilty of such a crime would be a disgrace to our family. Always be honest, Clarence! Depend upon it, honesty is the best policy, and a boy or man makes a great mistake who appropriates what is not his own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course, pa, I know all that. Do you think I would steal? As to Ben Baker, that\u0027s a different matter. He\u0027s always been poor, and I suppose the temptation was too strong for him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let us hope not. Dishonesty I could not overlook, even in a relation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who would imagine that this man, so strict in his ideas of honesty, had deliberately stolen a hundred thousand dollars from his widowed sister and her son!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80935.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
