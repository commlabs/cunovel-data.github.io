{"id":17392,"no":15,"title":"Chapter XV A Quaint Love Pact","content":"\u0026nbsp;One evening after a hard morning\u0027s work on my book, and a particularly fatiguing afternoon spent in vainly trying to lift Hubbard out of a funereal mood, I thought I should make myself a present of a few minutes\u0027 conversation with Miss Ottley. I argued that she would be sure to spend the evening out somewhere, so I knocked at her father\u0027s door a few minutes before eight o\u0027clock. A gloomy-looking footman opened the door. Yes, Miss Ottley was at home. He would give her my card. Would I wait? I would, though I wondered. I heard Dr. Belleville\u0027s voice. It issued from a room that opened on the hall. He was talking shrilly as though he were angered, and in French, perhaps to spare the feelings of the servants. He kept repeating that he had made up his mind and that he would not wait another day for God Almighty. All of a sudden the door opened and he stalked out looking like the baffled villain in a melodrama. We came face to face. He stopped dead and glared at me. \"You!\" he gasped. \"What are you doing here; what do you want?\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I glanced beyond him and saw Miss Ottley. He had been speaking to her, then, and like that. My blood began to boil. I advanced upon him trying to smile. I had seen Miss Ottley\u0027s face. \"I want you to go right back into that room and pretend you are a gentleman,\" I said. The girl had put a kerchief to her eyes. \"Quickly!\" I added.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Belleville returned into the room.
