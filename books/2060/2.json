After they\u0027d carted us off to the airport to and onto the Academy\u0027s private jet, he\u0027d taken one look at the two of us whispering and ordered us separated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let them talk to each other,\" he warned the guardian who escorted me to the back of the plane. \"Five minutes together, and they\u0027ll come up with an escape plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a haughty look and stormed off down the aisle. Never mind the fact we had been planning escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was, things didn\u0027t look good for our heroes - or heroines, rather. Once we were in the air, our odds of escape dropped further. Even supposing a miracle occurred and I did manage to take out all ten guardians, we\u0027d sort of have a problem in getting off the plane. I figured they might have parachutes aboard somewhere, but in the unlikely event I\u0027d be able to operate one, there was still that little issue of survival, seeing as we\u0027d probably land somewhere in the Rocky Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, we weren\u0027t getting off this plane until it landed in backwoods Montana. I\u0027d have to think of something then, something that involved getting past the Academy\u0027s magical wards and ten times as many guardians. Yeah. No problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Lissa sat at the front with the Russian guy, her fear sang back to me, pounding inside my head like a hammer. My concern for her cut into my fury. They couldn\u0027t take her back there, not to that place. I wondered if Dimitri might have hesitated if he could feel what I did and if he knew what I knew. Probably not. He didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was, her emotions grew so strong that for a moment, I had the disorienting sensation of sitting in her seat - in her skin even. It happened sometimes, and without much warning, she\u0027d pull me right into her head. Dimitri\u0027s tall frame sat beside me, and my hand - her hand - gripped a bottle of water. He leaned forward to pick up something, revealing six tiny symbols tattooed on the back of his neck: molnija marks. They looked like two streaks of jagged lightning crossing in an X symbol. One for each Strigoi he\u0027d killed. Above them was a twisting line, sort of like a snake, that marked him as a guardian. The promise mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking, I fought against her and shifted back into my own head with a grimace. I hated when that happened. Feeling Lissa\u0027s emotions was one thing, but slipping into her was something we both despised. She saw it as an invasion of privacy, so I usually didn\u0027t tell her when it happened. Neither of us could control it. It was another effect of the bond, a bond neither of us fully understood. Legends existed about psychic links between guardians and their Moroi, but the stories had never mentioned anything like this. We fumbled through it as best we could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the end of the flight, Dimitri walked back to where I sat and traded places with the guardian beside me. I pointedly turned away, staring out the window absentmindedly Several moments of silence passed. Finally, he said, \"Were you really going to attack all of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing that¡­protecting her like that - it was very brave.\" He paused. \"Stupid, but still brave. Why did you even try it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over at him, brushing my hair out of my face so I could look him levelly in the eye. \"Because I\u0027m her guardian.\" I turned back toward the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another quiet moment, he stood up and returned to the front of the jet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we landed, Lissa and I had no choice but to let the commandos drive us out to the Academy. Our car stopped at the gate, and our driver spoke with guards who verified we weren\u0027t Strigoi about to go off on a killing spree. After a minute, they let us pass on through the wards and up to the Academy itself. It was around sunset - the start of the vampiric day - and the campus lay wrapped in shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt probably looked the same, sprawling and gothic. The Moroi were big on tradition; nothing ever changed with them. This school wasn\u0027t as old as the ones back in Europe, but it had been built in the same style. The buildings boasted elaborate, almost churchlike architecture, with high peaks and stone carvings. Wrought iron gates enclosed small gardens and doorways here and there. After living on a college campus, I had a new appreciation for just how much this place resembled a university more than a typical high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were on the secondary campus, which was divided into lower and upper schools. Each was built around a large open quadrangle decorated with stone paths and enormous, century-old trees. We were going toward the upper school\u0027s quad, which had academic buildings on one side, while dhampir dormitories and the gym sat opposite. Moroi dorms sat on one of the other ends, and opposite them were the administrative buildings that also served the lower school. Younger students lived on the primary campus, farther to the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround all the campuses was space, space, and more space. We were in Montana, after all, miles away from any real city. The air felt cool in my lungs and smelled of pine and wet, decaying leaves. Overgrown forests ringed the perimeters of the Academy, and during the day, you could see mountains rising up in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked into the main part of the upper school, I broke from my guardian and ran up to Dimitri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Comrade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept walking and wouldn\u0027t look at me. \"You want to talk now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you taking us to Kirova?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Headmistress Kirova,\" he corrected. On the other side of him, Lissa shot me a look that said, Don\u0027t start something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Headmistress. Whatever. She\u0027s still a self-righteous old bit - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words faded as the guardians led us through a set of doors-straight into the commons. I sighed. Were these people really so cruel? There had to be at least a dozen ways to get to Kirova\u0027s office, and they were taking us right through the center of the commons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was breakfast time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNovice guardians - dhampirs like me - and Moroi sat together, eating and socializing, faces alight with whatever current gossip held the Academy\u0027s attention. When we entered, the loud buzz of conversation stopped instantly, like someone had flipped a switch. Hundreds of sets of eyes swiveled toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned the stares of my former classmates with a lazy grin, trying to get a sense as to whether things had changed. Nope. Didn\u0027t seem like it. Camille Conta still looked like the prim, perfectly groomed bitch I remembered, still the self-appointed leader of the Academy\u0027s royal Moroi cliques. Off to the side, Lissa\u0027s gawky near-cousin Natalie watched with wide eyes, as innocent and na?ve as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on the other side of the room¡­well, that was interesting. Aaron. Poor, poor Aaron, who\u0027d no doubt had his heart broken when Lissa left. He still looked as cute as ever - maybe more so now - with those same golden looks that complemented hers so well. His eyes followed her every move. Yes. Definitely not over her. It was sad, really, because Lissa had never really been all that into him. I think she\u0027d gone out with him simply because it seemed like the expected thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what I found most interesting was that Aaron had apparently found a way to pass the time without her. Beside him, holding his hand, was a Moroi girl who looked about eleven but had to be older, unless he\u0027d become a pedophile during our absence. With plump little cheeks and blond ringlets, she looked like a porcelain doll. A very pissed off and evil porcelain doll. She gripped his hand tightly and shot Lissa a look of such burning hatred that it stunned me. What the hell was that all about? She was no one I knew. Just a jealous girlfriend, I guessed. I\u0027d be pissed too if my guy was watching someone else like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur walk of shame mercifully ended, though our new setting - Headmistress Kirova\u0027s office - didn\u0027t really improve things. The old hag looked exactly like I remembered, sharp-nosed and gray-haired. She was tall and slim, like most Moroi, and had always reminded me of a vulture. I knew her well because I\u0027d spent a lot of time in her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of our escorts left us once Lissa and I were seated, and I felt a little less like a prisoner. Only Alberta, the captain of the school\u0027s guardians, and Dimitri stayed. They took up positions along the wall, looking stoic and terrifying, just as their job description required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirova fixed her angry eyes on us and opened her mouth to begin what would no doubt be a major bitch session. A deep, gentle voice stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vasilisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, I realized there was someone else in the room. I hadn\u0027t noticed. Careless for a guardian, even a novice one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a great deal of effort, Victor Dashkov rose from a corner chair. Prince Victor Dashkov. Lissa sprang up and ran to him, throwing her arms around his frail body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle,\" she whispered. She sounded on the verge of tears as she tightened her grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a small smile, he gently patted her back. \"You have no idea how glad I am to see you safe, Vasilisa.\" He looked toward me. \"And you too, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded back, trying to hide how shocked I was. He\u0027d been sick when we left, but this - this was horrible. He was Natalie\u0027s father, only about forty or so, but he looked twice that age. Pale. Withered. Hands shaking. My heart broke watching him. With all the horrible people in the world, it didn\u0027t seem fair that this guy should get a disease that was going to kill him young and ultimately keep him from becoming king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not technically her uncle - the Moroi used family terms very loosely, especially the royals - Victor was a close friend of Lissa\u0027s family and had gone out of his way to help her after her parents had died. I liked him; he was the first person I was happy to see here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirova let them have a few more moments and then stiffly drew Lissa back to her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for the lecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good one - one of Kirova\u0027s best, which was saying something. She was a master at them. I swear that was the only reason she\u0027d gone into school administration, because I had yet to see any evidence of her actually liking kids. The rant covered the usual topics: responsibility reckless behavior, self-centeredness¡­Bleh. I immediately found myself spacing out, alternatively pondering the logistics of escaping through the window in her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the tirade shifted to me - well, that was when I tuned back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, Miss Hathaway, broke the most sacred promise among our kind: the promise of a guardian to protect a Moroi. It is a great trust. A trust that you violated by selfishly taking the princess away from here. The Strigoi would love to finish off the Dragomirs; you nearly enabled them to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose didn\u0027t kidnap me.\" Lissa spoke before I could, her voice and face calm, despite her uneasy feelings. \"I wanted to go. Don\u0027t blame her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Kirova tsked at us both and paced the office, hands folded behind her narrow back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Dragomir, you could have been the one who orchestrated the entire plan for all I know, but it was still her responsibility to make sure you didn\u0027t carry it out. If she\u0027d done her duty, she would have notified someone. If she\u0027d done her duty, she would have kept you safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did do my duty!\" I shouted, jumping up from my chair. Dimitri and Alberta both flinched but left me alone since I wasn\u0027t trying to hit anyone. Yet. \"I did keep her safe! I kept her safe when none of you\" - I made a sweeping gesture around the room - \"could do it. I took her away to protect her. I did what I had to do. You certainly weren\u0027t going to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the bond, I felt Lissa trying to send me calming messages, again urging me not to let anger get the best of me. Too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirova stared at me, her face blank. \"Miss Hathaway, forgive me if I fail to see the logic of how taking her out of a heavily guarded, magically secured environment is protecting her. Unless there\u0027s something you aren\u0027t telling us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Well, then. By my estimation, the only reason you left - aside from the novelty of it, no doubt - was to avoid the consequences of that horrible, destructive stunt you pulled just before your disappearance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s not - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that only makes my decision that much easier. As a Moroi, the princess must continue on here at the Academy for her own safety, but we have no such obligations to you. You will be sent away as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cockiness dried up. \"I¡­what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa stood up beside me. \"You can\u0027t do that! She\u0027s my guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is no such thing, particularly since she isn\u0027t even a guardian at all. She\u0027s still a novice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my parents - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what your parents wanted, God rest their souls, but things have changed. Miss Hathaway is expendable. She doesn\u0027t deserve to be a guardian, and she will leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Kirova, unable to believe what I was hearing. \"Where are you going to send me? To my mom in Nepal? Did she even know I was gone? Or maybe you\u0027ll send me off to my father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed at the bite in that last word. When I spoke again, my voice was so cold, I barely recognized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe you\u0027re going to try to send me off to be a blood whore. Try that, and we\u0027ll be gone by the end of the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Hathaway,\" she hissed, \"you are out of line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have a bond.\" Dimitri\u0027s low, accented voice broke the heavy tension, and we all turned toward him. I think Kirova had forgotten he was there, but I hadn\u0027t. His presence was way too powerful to ignore. He still stood against the wall, looking like some sort of cowboy sentry in that ridiculous long coat of his. He looked at me, not Lissa, his dark eyes staring straight through me. \"Rose knows what Vasilisa is feeling. Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI at least had the satisfaction of seeing Kirova caught off guard as she glanced between us and Dimitri. \"No¡­that\u0027s impossible. That hasn\u0027t happened in centuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s obvious,\" he said. \"I suspected as soon as I started watching them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Lissa nor I responded, and I averted my eyes from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is a gift,\" murmured Victor from his corner. \"A rare and wonderful thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best guardians always had that bond,\" added Dimitri. \"In the stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirova\u0027s outrage returned. \"Stories that are centuries old,\" she exclaimed. \"Surely you aren\u0027t suggesting we let her stay at the Academy after everything she\u0027s done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"She might be wild and disrespectful, but if she has potential - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wild and disrespectful?\" I interrupted. \"Who the hell are you anyway? Outsourced help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guardian Belikov is the princess\u0027s guardian now,\" said Kirova. \"Her sanctioned guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got cheap foreign labor to protect Lissa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was pretty mean of me to say - particularly since most Moroi and their guardians were of Russian or Romanian descent - but the comment seemed cleverer at the time than it really was. And it wasn\u0027t like I was one to talk. I might have been raised in the U.S., but my parents were foreign-born. My dhampir mother was Scottish - red-haired, with a ridiculous accent - and I\u0027d been told my Moroi dad was Turkish. That genetic combination had given me skin the same color as the inside of an almond, along with what I liked to think were semi-exotic desert-princess features: big dark eyes and hair so deep brown that it usually looked black. I wouldn\u0027t have minded inheriting the red hair, but we take what we get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirova threw her hands up in exasperation and turned to him. \"You see? Completely undisciplined! All the psychic bonds and very raw potential in the world can\u0027t make up for that. A guardian without discipline is worse than no guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So teach her discipline. Classes just started. Put her back in and get her training again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible. She\u0027ll still be hopelessly behind her peers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I won\u0027t,\" I argued. No one listened to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then give her extra training sessions,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued on while the rest of us watched the exchange like it was a Ping-Pong game. My pride was still hurt over the ease with which Dimitri had tricked us, but it occurred to me that he might very well keep me here with Lissa. Better to stay at this hellhole than be without her. Through our bond, I could feel her trickle of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s going to put in the extra time?\" demanded Kirova. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri\u0027s argument came to an abrupt stop. \"Well, that\u0027s not what I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirova crossed her arms with satisfaction. \"Yes. That\u0027s what I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly at a loss, he frowned. His eyes flicked toward Lissa and me, and I wondered what he saw. Two pathetic girls, looking at him with big, pleading eyes? Or two runaways who\u0027d broken out of a high-security school and swiped half of Lissa\u0027s inheritance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said finally. \"I can mentor Rose. I\u0027ll give her extra sessions along with her normal ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what?\" retorted Kirova angrily. \"She goes unpunished?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find some other way to punish her,\" answered Dimitri. \"Guardian numbers have gone down too much to risk losing another. A girl, in particular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis unspoken words made me shudder, reminding me of my earlier statement about \"blood whores.\" Few dhampir girls became guardians anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor suddenly spoke up from his corner. \"I\u0027m inclined to agree with Guardian Belikov. Sending Rose away would be a shame, a waste of talent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Kirova stared out her window. It was completely black outside. With the Academy\u0027s nocturnal schedule, morning and afternoon were relative terms. That, and they kept the windows tinted to block out excess light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned back around, Lissa met her eyes. \"Please, Ms. Kirova. Let Rose stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Lissa, I thought. Be careful. Using compulsion on another Moroi was dangerous - particularly in front of witnesses. But Lissa was only using a tiny bit, and we needed all the help we could get. Fortunately, no one seemed to realize what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even know if the compulsion made a difference, but finally, Kirova sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Miss Hathaway stays, here\u0027s how it will be.\" She turned to me. \"Your continued enrollment at St. Vladimir\u0027s is strictly probationary. Step out of line once, and you\u0027re gone. You will attend all classes and required trainings for novices your age. You will also train with Guardian Belikov in every spare moment you have - before and after classes. Other than that, you are banned from all social activities, except meals, and will stay in your dorm. Fail to comply with any of this, and you will be sent¡­away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave a harsh laugh. \"Banned from all social activities? Are you trying to keep us apart?\" I nodded toward Lissa. \"Afraid we\u0027ll run away again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking precautions. As I\u0027m sure you recall, you were never properly punished for destroying school property. You have a lot to make up for.\" Her thin lips tightened into a straight line. \"You are being offered a very generous deal. I suggest you don\u0027t let your attitude endanger it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to say it wasn\u0027t generous at all, but then I caught Dimitri\u0027s gaze. It was hard to read. He might have been telling me he believed in me. He might have been telling me I was an idiot to keep fighting with Kirova. I didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking away from him for the second time during the meeting, I stared at the floor, conscious of Lissa beside me and her own encouragement burning in our bond. At long last, I exhaled and glanced back up at the headmistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I accept.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-2.html","bookId":2060,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM"}
