Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe enter Shane\u0027s bedroom and Colin pulls me down on the bed with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push him away when he nuzzles my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop acting like I\u0027m going to force you, Brit,\" Colin slurs. The bed creaks under his weight. \"Ever since school started you\u0027ve been acting like a damn prude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up. \"I don\u0027t want to base our relationship on sex. It\u0027s like we never talk anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So talk,\" he says as his hand wanders on my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go first. You say something, then I\u0027ll say something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the stupidest fucking thing I\u0027ve ever heard. I don\u0027t have anything to say, Brit. If you\u0027ve got something on your mind, let it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathe deeply, chastising myself for feeling more comfortable with Alex than here in a bed with Colin. I can\u0027t let our relationship end. My mom would freak, my friends would freak . . . the solar system would go out of alignment. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin pulls me beside him. I can\u0027t break up with him just because I\u0027m scared of having sex. He is, after all, a virgin, too. And he\u0027s waiting for me so we could share our first time together. Most of our friends have done it; maybe I\u0027m being silly about the whole thing. Maybe my interest in Alex is my excuse to avoid doing it with Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin\u0027s arm snakes around my waist. We\u0027ve spent two years together, why blow it all for some silly attraction to someone I shouldn\u0027t even be talking to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his lips are inches from mine, my gaze freezes. On Shane\u0027s dresser is a picture. Shane and Colin at the beach this summer. There are two girls with them, and Colin has his arms intimately around the cute one with brown hair and a short, shag cut. They\u0027re smiling wide, as if they have a secret they aren\u0027t about to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to the picture. \"Who\u0027s that?\" I ask, trying to keep the unease out of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a couple of girls we met at the beach,\" he says, leaning back while looking at the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of the girl you have your arm around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I think it was Mia or something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like a couple,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous. Come here,\" he says, pushing himself up and blocking my view of the picture. \"You\u0027re the one I want now, Brit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does he mean by now? As if he wanted Mia over the summer, but now he wants me? Am I overanalyzing his words?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can think further, he eases my dress and bra up to my chin. I\u0027m trying to get into the mood and convince myself my hesitation stems from my nervousness. \"Did you lock the door?\" I ask, filing my uneasiness into the dark recesses of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he says, totally concentrating on my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing I need to participate but having a hard time motivating myself, I feel him through his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin lifts himself up, pushes my hand away, and unzips himself. When he lowers his pants down to his knees he says, \"Come on, Brit. Let\u0027s try something new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not feeling right, it feels orchestrated. I move closer, although my mind is far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door creaks open and Shane\u0027s head pokes into the room. His mouth stretches into a wide grin. \"Holy shit! Where\u0027s a cell phone camera when you need one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you locked the door!\" I say angrily to Colin as I quickly pull my bra and dress back down. \"You lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin grabs the blanket and covers himself. \"Shane, give us some fucking privacy, will ya? Brit, stop freaking out like a psycho.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case you hadn\u0027t noticed, this is my room,\" Shane says. He leans against the doorway and wiggles his eyebrows at me. \"Brit, tell me the truth. Are those real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shane, you\u0027re a pig,\" I say, then move away from Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin reaches for me as I hop off the bed. \"Come back here, Brit. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t lock it. I was caught up in the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is, the unlocked door is only part of the reason why I\u0027m mad. He called me \"psycho\" and didn\u0027t think twice about it. And he didn\u0027t defend me to Shane. I look back at my boyfriend. \"Yeah? Well right now I\u0027m caught up in the act of leaving,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one thirty in the morning I\u0027m staring at my cell phone in my bedroom. Colin has called thirty-six times. And left ten messages. Since Sierra drove me home, I\u0027ve ignored him. Mostly because I need to let my anger deflate. I\u0027m mortified Shane saw me half undressed. In the time it took me to find Sierra and asked her to take me home, at least five people were whispering about my show in Shane\u0027s room. I don\u0027t want to blow up like my mom does, and I was about to lose it on Shane and Colin back at Shane\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Colin\u0027s thirty-ninth call, my heart rate is as slow as it\u0027s gonna get tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally answer it. \"Stop calling me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stop calling when you listen to what I have to say,\" Colin says on the other end of the line, frustration laced through his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So talk. I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear him take a deep breath. \"I\u0027m sorry, Brit. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t lock the door tonight. I\u0027m sorry for wanting to have sex. I\u0027m sorry one of my best friends thinks he\u0027s funny when he\u0027s not. I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t stand watching you and Fuentes in Peterson\u0027s class. I\u0027m sorry I changed this summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what to say. He has changed. Have I? Or am I the same person who he said good-bye to before he left for the summer? I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s one thing I do know, though. \"Colin, I don\u0027t want to fight anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, neither. Can you just try to forget tonight ever happened? I promise I\u0027ll make it up to you. Remember our anniversary last year when my uncle flew us to Michigan for the day in his Cessna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended up at a resort. When we got to the restaurant for dinner that night, a huge bouquet of red roses was on our table, along with a turquoise box. Inside was a white gold bracelet from Tiffany\u0027s. \"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to buy you the earrings that match the bracelet, Brit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t have the heart to tell him that it\u0027s not the earrings I want. I love the bracelet a ton and wear it all the time. But what blew me away wasn\u0027t the gift, it was that Colin went above and beyond in the planning of the day just to make it super special for us. That\u0027s what I remember when I look at the bracelet. Not the gift, but the meaning behind it. I\u0027ve only seen small glimpses of that Colin since school started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expensive earrings would be a symbol of Colin\u0027s apology and would remind me of tonight. It might also serve to guilt me into giving something to him . . . like my virginity. He might not think of it consciously, but just the fact that the thought is lingering in my mind is a sign. I don\u0027t want that pressure. \"Colin, I don\u0027t want the earrings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do you want? Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me a while to answer. Six months ago I could have written a hundred-page essay on what I wanted. Since school started, everything has turned around. \"Right now I don\u0027t know what I want.\" I feel bad for saying it, but it\u0027s the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when you figure it out will you clue me in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, if I ever figure it out myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 28 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday I try not to read too much into my anticipation for chemistry. Surely it\u0027s not Mrs. P. making me crave class. It\u0027s Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks into class late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I say to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she mumbles back. No smile, no bright eyes. Something is definitely bothering her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, class,\" Mrs. P. says. \"Get out your pencils. Let\u0027s see how well you\u0027ve been studying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I silently curse Mrs. P. for not having a lab day with experiments so we can talk, I glance over at my partner. She looks totally unprepared. Feeling protective even though I have no right, I raise my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid to call on you, Alex,\" Mrs. P. says, staring down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a small question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead. Make it quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is an open book test, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teacher glares at me over her glasses. \"No, Alex, this is not an open book test. And if you didn\u0027t study, you\u0027re going to get yourself a big fat F. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop my books with a loud thud onto the floor in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Mrs. P. passes out the test, I read the first question. The density of Al (aluminum) is 2.7 grams per millimeter. What volume will 10.5 grams of Al (aluminum) occupy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I work out my answer, I look over at Brittany. She\u0027s staring blankly at the test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching me watching her, she sneers. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothin\u0027. Nada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then stop staring at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. P. is looking right at us. Taking a deep breath to calm myself, I go back to working on the test. Does Brittany have to do that, get all hot-and-cold without warning? What sets her off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye, I see my chem partner grab the bathroom pass off the hook by the classroom door. Problem is, the bathroom pass can\u0027t help you escape life. It\u0027s still there when you come out. Believe me, I\u0027ve tried it. Problems and crap don\u0027t go away by hiding in the can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in class, Brittany lays her head on the lab table as she scribbles answers. One glance and I know she\u0027s not into it, the girl is doing a half-ass job. And when Mrs. P. orders everyone to hand in their papers, my chem partner has a blank stare on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it makes you feel any better,\" I say quietly so only Brittany can hear, \"I flunked health class in eighth grade for puttin\u0027 a lit cigarette in the dummy\u0027s mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up she says, \"Good for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic pipes through the speaker, signaling the end of class. I watch Brittany\u0027s golden hair bouncing less than usual as she shuffles out of class, surprisingly not accompanied by her boyfriend. I wonder if she thinks everything is supposed to land in her lap, even good grades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to work for everything I have. Nothing lands in my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hiya, Alex.\" Carmen is standing in front of my locker. Okay, so some things do land in my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quepasa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ex-girlfriend leans toward me, the deep V of her shirt extra low-cut. \"A bunch of us are going to hang out at the beach after school. Wanna come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to work,\" I tell her. \"Maybe I\u0027ll catch up with ya later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about two weekends ago. After going to Brittany\u0027s house only to be talked down to by her mother, something inside me snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting drunk to drown my busted ego was a dumb idea. I wanted to be with Brittany, to hang out with her not only to study but to find out what\u0027s underneath those blond streaks. My chem partner blew me off. Carmen didn\u0027t. The memory is a hazy one, but I remember Carmen in the lake, wrapping her body around me. And sitting on top of me by the fire as we smoked something much stronger than a Marlboro. In my inebriated and stoned ego-busted state, any girl would have felt good to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmen was there, willing, and I owe her an apology because even if she was offering, I shouldn\u0027t have nibbled at the bait. I\u0027ll have to catch up with her and explain my dumbass behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, there\u0027s a crowd around my motorcycle. Shit, if anything happened to Julio I swear I\u0027m going to kick someone\u0027s ass. I don\u0027t have to push through the crowd because a path opens up when I get close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes are on me as I witness the vandalism to my motorcycle. They\u0027re expecting me to be in a rage. After all, who would dare attach a pink tricycle horn to the handlebars and tape sparkling streamers from the ends of the handles? Nobody can get away with this shit. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-22.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
