An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll.Langdon and Teabing seemed to have stopped breathing as they looked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS... O... F...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carefully,\" Teabing urged. \"Ever so carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... I... A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie aligned the final dial. \"Okay,\" she whispered, glancing up at the others. \"I\u0027m going to pull it apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember the vinegar,\" Langdon whispered with fearful exhilaration. \"Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie knew that if this cryptex were like those she had opened in her youth, all she would need to do is grip the cylinder at both ends, just beyond the dials, and pull, applying slow, steady pressure in opposite directions. If the dials were properly aligned with the password, then one of the ends would slide off, much like a lens cap, and she could reach inside and remove the rolled papyrus document, which would be wrapped around the vial of vinegar. However, if the password they had entered were incorrect, Sophie\u0027s outward force on the ends would be transferred to a hinged lever inside, which would pivot downward into the cavity and apply pressure to the glass vial, eventually shattering it if she pulled too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePull gently, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing and Langdon both leaned in as Sophie wrapped her palms around the ends of the cylinder. In the excitement of deciphering the code word, Sophie had almost forgotten what they expected to find inside. This is the Priory keystone.According to Teabing, it contained a map to the Holy Grail, unveiling the tomb of Mary Magdalene and the Sangreal treasure... the ultimate treasure trove of secret truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow gripping the stone tube, Sophie double-checked that all of the letters were properly aligned with the indicator. Then, slowly, she pulled. Nothing happened. She applied a little more force. Suddenly, the stone slid apart like a well-crafted telescope. The heavy end piece detached in her hand. Langdon and Teabing almost jumped to their feet. Sophie\u0027s heart rate climbed as she set the end cap on the table and tipped the cylinder to peer inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scroll!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeering down the hollow of the rolled paper, Sophie could see it had been wrapped around a cylindrical object - the vial of vinegar, she assumed. Strangely, though, the paper around the vinegar was not the customary delicate papyrus but rather, vellum. That\u0027s odd, she thought, vinegar can\u0027t dissolve a lambskin vellum.She looked again down the hollow of the scroll and realized the object in the center was not a vial of vinegar after all. It was something else entirely. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Teabing asked. \"Pull out the scroll.\" Frowning, Sophie grabbed the rolled vellum and the object around which it was wrapped, pulling them both out of the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not papyrus,\" Teabing said. \"It\u0027s too heavy.\" \"I know. It\u0027s padding.\" \"For what? The vial of vinegar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Sophie unrolled the scroll and revealed what was wrapped inside. \"For this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Langdon saw the object inside the sheet of vellum, his heart sank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God help us,\" Teabing said, slumping. \"Your grandfather was a pitiless architect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stared in amazement. I see Sauniere has no intention of making this easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the table sat a second cryptex. Smaller. Made of black onyx. It had been nested within the first. Sauniere\u0027s passion for dualism. Two cryptexes.Everything in pairs. Double entendres.Male female.Black nested within white.Langdon felt the web of symbolism stretching onward. White gives birthto black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery man sprang from woman. White - female. Black - male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching over, Langdon lifted the smaller cryptex. It looked identical to the first, except half the size and black. He heard the familiar gurgle. Apparently, the vial of vinegar they had heard earlier was inside this smaller cryptex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Robert,\" Teabing said, sliding the page of vellum over to him. \"You\u0027ll be pleased to hear that at least we\u0027re flying in the right direction.\" Langdon examined the thick vellum sheet. Written in ornate penmanship was another four-line verse. Again, in iambic pentameter. The verse was cryptic, but Langdon needed to read only as far as the first line to realize that Teabing\u0027s plan to come to Britain was going to pay off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN LONDON LIES A KNIGHT A POPE INTERRED.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remainder of the poem clearly implied that the password for opening the second cryptex could be found by visiting this knight\u0027s tomb, somewhere in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon turned excitedly to Teabing. \"Do you have any idea what knight this poem is referring to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing grinned. \"Not the foggiest. But I know in precisely which crypt we should look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, fifteen miles ahead of them, six Kent police cars streaked down rain-soaked streets toward Biggin Hill Executive Airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 79\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Collet helped himself to a Perrier from Teabing\u0027s refrigerator and strode back out through the drawing room. Rather than accompanying Fache to London where the action was, he was now baby-sitting the PTS team that had spread out through Chateau Villette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, the evidence they had uncovered was unhelpful: a single bullet buried in the floor; a paper with several symbols scrawled on it along with the words blade and chalice; and a bloody spiked belt that PTS had told Collet was associated with the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, which had caused a stir recently when a news program exposed their aggressive recruiting practices in Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollet sighed. Good luck making sense of this unlikely melange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving down a lavish hallway, Collet entered the vast ballroom study, where the chief PTS examiner was busy dusting for fingerprints. He was a corpulent man in suspenders. \"Anything?\" Collet asked, entering. The examiner shook his head. \"Nothing new. Multiple sets matching those in the rest of the house.\" \"How about the prints on the cilice belt?\" \"Interpol is still working. I uploaded everything we found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollet motioned to two sealed evidence bags on the desk. \"And this?\" The man shrugged. \"Force of habit. I bag anything peculiar.\" Collet walked over. Peculiar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Brit\u0027s a strange one,\" the examiner said. \"Have a look at this.\" He sifted through the evidence bags and selected one, handing it to Collet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photo showed the main entrance of a Gothic cathedral - the traditional, recessed archway, narrowing through multiple, ribbed layers to a small doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollet studied the photo and turned. \"This is peculiar?\" \"Turn it over.\" On the back, Collet found notations scrawled in English, describing a cathedral\u0027s long hollow nave as a secret pagan tribute to a woman\u0027s womb. This was strange. The notation describing the cathedral\u0027s doorway, however, was what startled him. \"Hold on! He thinks a cathedral\u0027s entrance represents a woman\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe examiner nodded. \"Complete with receding labial ridges and a nice little cinquefoil clitoris above the doorway.\" He sighed. \"Kind of makes you want to go back to church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollet picked up the second evidence bag. Through the plastic, he could see a large glossy photograph of what appeared to be an old document. The heading at the top read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLes Dossiers Secrets - Number 4o lm1 249\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" Collet asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea. He\u0027s got copies of it all over the place, so I bagged it.\" Collet studied the document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRIEURE DE SIGN - LES NAUTONIERS/GRAND MASTERS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJEAN DE GISORS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1188-1220\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARIE DE SAINT-CLAIR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1220-1266\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGUILLAUME DE GlSORS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1266-1307\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDOUARD DE BAR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1307-1336\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJEANNE DE BAR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1336-1351\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJEAN DE SAINT-CLAIR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1351-1366\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBLANCE D\u0027EVREUX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1366-1398\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNICOLAS FLAMEL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1398-1418\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRENE D\u0027ANJOU\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1418-1480\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIOLANDE DE BAR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1480-1483\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSANDRO BOTTICELLI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1483-1510\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLEONARDO DA VINCI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1510-1519\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCONNETABLE DE BOURBON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1519-1527\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFERDINAND DE GONZAQUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1527-1575\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOUIS DE NEVERS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1575-1595\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROBERT FLUDD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1595-1637\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJ.

My name is Lieutenant Collet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause on the line. \"Lieutenant, I have another call coming in. Please excuse me. I will call you later.\" He hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor several seconds, Collet held the receiver. Then it dawned on him. I knew I recognized that voice! The revelation made him gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armored car driver.With the fake Rolex. Collet now understood why the banker had hung up so quickly.

Emotionally, he knew this lucky break was going to be his moment to shine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe immediately called Interpol and requested every shred of information they could find on the Depository Bank of Zurich and its president, Andre Vernet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 80\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seat belts, please,\" Teabing\u0027s pilot announced as the Hawker 731 descended into a gloomy morning drizzle. \"We\u0027ll be landing in five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing felt a joyous sense of homecoming when he saw the misty hills of Kent spreading wide beneath the descending plane. England was less than an hour from Paris, and yet a world away. This morning, the damp, spring green of his homeland looked particularly welcoming. My time in France is over.I am returning to England victorious.The keystone has been found.The question remained, of course, as to where the keystone would ultimately lead. Somewhere in the United Kingdom.Where exactly, Teabing had no idea, but he was already tasting the glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon and Sophie looked on, Teabing got up and went to the far side of the cabin, then slid aside a wall panel to reveal a discreetly hidden wall safe. He dialed in the combination, opened the safe, and extracted two passports. \"Documentation for Remy and myself.\" He then removed a thick stack of fifty-pound notes. \"And documentation for you two.\" Sophie looked leery. \"A bribe?\" \"Creative diplomacy. Executive airfields make certain allowances. A British customs official will greet us at my hangar and ask to board the plane. Rather than permitting him to come on, I\u0027ll tell him I\u0027m traveling with a French celebrity who prefers that nobody knows she is in England - press considerations, you know - and I\u0027ll offer the official this generous tip as gratitude for his discretion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked amazed. \"And the official will accept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from anyone, they won\u0027t, but these people all know me. I\u0027m not an arms dealer, for heaven\u0027s sake. I was knighted.\" Teabing smiled. \"Membership has its privileges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy approached up the aisle now, the Heckler Koch pistol cradled in his hand. \"Sir, my agenda?\" Teabing glanced at his servant. \"I\u0027m going to have you stay onboard with our guest until we return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t very well drag him all over London with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie looked wary. \"Leigh, I was serious about the French police finding your plane before we return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing laughed. \"Yes, imagine their surprise if they board and find Remy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie looked surprised by his cavalier attitude. \"Leigh, you transported a bound hostage across international borders. This is serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are my lawyers.\" He scowled toward the monk in the rear of the plane. \"That animal broke into my home and almost killed me. That is a fact, and Remy will corroborate.\" \"But you tied him up and flew him to London!\" Langdon said. Teabing held up his right hand and feigned a courtroom oath. \"Your honor, forgive an eccentric old knight his foolish prejudice for the British court system. I realize I should have called the French authorities, but I\u0027m a snob and do not trust those laissez-faire French to prosecute properly. This man almost murdered me. Yes, I made a rash decision forcing my manservant to help me bring him to England, but I was under great stress. Mea culpa. Mea culpa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked incredulous. \"Coming from you, Leigh, that just might fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\" the pilot called back. \"The tower just radioed. They\u0027ve got some kind of maintenance problem out near your hangar, and they\u0027re asking me to bring the plane directly to the terminal instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing had been flying to Biggin Hill for over a decade, and this was a first. \"Did they mention what the problem is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The controller was vague. Something about a gas leak at the pumping station? They asked me to park in front of the terminal and keep everyone onboard until further notice. Safety precaution. We\u0027re not supposed to deplane until we get the all clear from airport authorities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing was skeptical. Must be one hell of a gas leak.The pumping station was a good half mile from his hangar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy also looked concerned. \"Sir, this sounds highly irregular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing turned to Sophie and Langdon. \"My friends, I have an unpleasant suspicion that we are about to be met by a welcoming committee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon gave a bleak sigh. \"I guess Fache still thinks I\u0027m his man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either that,\" Sophie said,\" or he is too deep into this to admit his error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing was not listening. Regardless of Fache\u0027s mind-set, action needed to be taken fast.

Leave you all out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, heavens, Robert!\" Teabing waved it off. \"Do you really think they\u0027re going to let the rest of us go? I just transported you illegally. Miss Neveu assisted in your escape from the Louvre, and we have a man tied up in the back of the plane. Really now! We\u0027re all in this together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a different airport?\" Sophie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing shook his head. \"If we pull up now, by the time we get clearance anywhere else, our welcoming party will include army tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie slumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeabing sensed that if they were to have any chance of postponing confrontation with the British authorities long enough to find the Grail, bold action had to be taken. \"Give me a minute,\" he said, hobbling toward the cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Langdon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sales meeting,\" Teabing said, wondering how much it would cost him to persuade his pilot to perform one highly irregular maneuver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-23.html","bookId":2227,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:49 PM"}
