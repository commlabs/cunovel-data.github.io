I’m suddenly gasping in huge, raging hyperventilated breaths, taking in lungfuls of air like I might cry if I don’t. I’m drinking oxygen, devouring it, choking on it, taking it in as quickly as possible, my entire body heaving as it strains to return to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest feels like it’s being stitched back together, like the flesh is regenerating itself, healing itself at an inhuman rate and I’m blinking and breathing and I’m moving my head and trying to see but it’s still so blurry, still unclear but it’s getting easier. I can feel my fingers and my toes and the life in my limbs and I can actually hear my heart beating again and suddenly the faces above me come into focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once the heat is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hands are gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI collapse back onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd everything goes black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEVENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner is sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know this because he’s sleeping right next to me. It’s dark enough that it takes me several tries to blink my eyes open and understand that I’m not blind this time. I catch a glimpse out the window and find the moon filled to the brim, pouring light into this little room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m still here. In Anderson’s house. In what probably used to be Warner’s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he’s asleep on the pillow right next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis features are so soft, so ethereal in the moonlight. His face is deceptively calm, so unassuming and innocent. And I think of how impossible it is that he’s here, lying next to me. That I’m here, lying next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat we’re lying in his childhood bed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he saved my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible is such a stupid word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift hardly at all and Warner reacts immediately, sitting straight up, chest heaving, eyes blinking. He looks at me, sees that I’m awake, that my eyes are open, and he freezes in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are so many things I want to say to him. So many things I have to tell him. So many things I need to do now, that I need to sort through, that I have to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now, I only have one question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s your father?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes Warner a moment to find his voice. He says, “He’s back on base. He left right after”—he hesitates, struggles for a second—“right after he shot you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left me bleeding all over his living room floor. What a nice little present for his son to clean up. What a nice little lesson for his son to learn. Fall in love, and you get to watch your love get shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he doesn’t know I’m here?” I ask Warner. “He doesn’t know I’m alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner shakes his head. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think, Good. That’s very good. It’ll be so much better if he thinks I’m dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner is still looking at me. Looking and looking and looking at me like he wants to touch me but he’s afraid to get too close. Finally, he whispers, “Are you okay, love? How do you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I smile to myself, thinking of all the ways I could answer that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of how my body is more exhausted, more defeated, more drained than it’s ever been in my life. I think about how I’ve had nothing but a glass of water in 2 days. How I’ve never been more confused about people, about who they seem to be and who they actually are, and I think about how I’m lying here, sharing a bed in a house we were told doesn’t exist anymore, with one of the most hated and feared people of Sector 45. And I think about how that terrifying creature has the capacity for such tenderness, how he saved my life. How his own father shot me in the chest. How only hours earlier I was lying in a pool of my own blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about how my friends are probably still locked in battle, how Adam must be suffering not knowing where I am or what’s happened to me. How Kenji is still pulling the weight of so many. How Brendan and Winston might still be lost. How the people of Omega Point might all be dead. And it makes me think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel better than I ever have in my entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m amazed by how different I feel now. How different I know things will be now. I have so many things to do. So many scores to settle. So many friends who need my help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything has changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause once upon a time I was just a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I’m still just a child, but this time I’ve got an iron will and 2 fists made of steel and I’ve aged 50 years. Now I finally have a clue. I’ve finally figured out that I’m strong enough, that maybe I’m a touch brave enough, that maybe this time I can do what I was meant to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I am a force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deviation of human nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am living, breathing proof that nature is officially screwed, afraid of what it’s done, what it’s become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m stronger. I’m angrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m ready to do something I’ll definitely regret and this time I don’t care. I’m done being nice. I’m done being nervous. I’m not afraid of anything anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMass chaos is in my future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m leaving my gloves behind. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unravel-me-shatter-me-2/page-54.html","bookId":1772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM"}
