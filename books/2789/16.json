Why don\u0027t you take a nap, relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, in here. This is as much your room as it is mine, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed unwillingly. \"Ah, no. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s right at all.\" Just as much hers? What had he been smoking? He was the prince; this was his dad\u0027s jet. She was a mongrel nobody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked longingly at the bedspread, which was the same color as the flight attendant\u0027s blazer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be weird . . . damn, there\u0027s that word again . . . sleeping on a plane while actually being comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God forbid you experience anything weird,\" he said. She looked at him narrowly, but from his innocent expression she had no idea what he truly meant by that. \"Here, come on. Lie down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crawled toward the head of the bed, felt him pull her shoes off, then flopped beneath the covers and sighed. \"All right. You\u0027re right. This is very relaxing.\" She drained the last of her Bloody Mary while lying down, then set the empty cup on the bedside table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped into bed beside her and she settled comfortably into the crook of his arm. Instantly she was no longer relaxed. Instead she was tense and almost. . . nauseated?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, my father didn\u0027t come along on this trip,\" David whispered, making all the hair on her left arm stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s just the two of us in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Picked up on that, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a Ph.D,\" he said solemnly. \"We\u0027re very observant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, there\u0027s a problem with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He was rubbing her shoulder with his right hand and nuzzling her ear. Under ordinary circumstances, that would be delightful. \"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is, if you grab my tits, I\u0027m probably going to throw up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of her like she was hot. \"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. Too much to drink, too tense, too weirded out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"That\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I don\u0027t want to join the Mile-High Club with you. But while we lust to reach that peak, I probably shouldn\u0027t be struggling not to puke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. It\u0027s a good rule of thumb for any romantic occasion, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, I\u0027m gonna be really pissed at myself later. Because, frankly, since the cedar closet, I\u0027ve been dying to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden pounding on the door. \"Your Highness! My lady! Stop it at once! \"Jenny\u0027s voice, sounding harassed. \"The king made me promise! No touchy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake,\" the prince muttered, while Christina giggled. \"Come in, Jenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe protocol officer fairly burst into the room. She had her hands tightly over her eyes. Her lips were curved into a grimace. \"I\u0027m very sorry to interrupt. But His Majesty made me promise. Could you please get dressed now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny,\" David said, exasperated, \"open your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly pulled her hand away and cracked one eye open. Then they both opened. \"Oh. Oh! Very good, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nap time,\" Chris explained. \"Not nookie time. Really, Jenn. You\u0027ve got such a filthy imagination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlushing harder (if that were possible—Christina feared the woman\u0027s head would soon blow up), she said, \"I\u0027m very sorry. Of course, you\u0027re tired ... the trip ... the preparations ... the ... uh ... I\u0027m going now. With your leave, Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave,\" David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny bobbed a quick bow and practically ran out, shutting the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotcha,\" Chris said, giggling, then moaned and clutched her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remind me to put a lock on that door,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll put it on my to-do list from hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that on my list, too?\" Before she could add something more sarcastic, she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . thanks to a generous endowment from Prince David, our feathered friends will have more room to play, interact, and do all the things we all love to watch them do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\" Christina muttered out of the side of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start,\" David muttered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, without further ado, I\u0027d like to introduce Prince David and his American fianc, who I understand loves the city of Boston—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild applause. Cheers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—Christina Krabbe!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The \u0027e\u0027 is silent,\" she sighed. Then she stood with the prince and grinned like a monkey and waved like a fucked-up prom queen while about a thousand flashbulbs went off in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were outside the New England Aquarium, but as it was cloudy, all the photographers had brought their flash packs. So she stood and smiled and was privately amazed ... didn\u0027t these reporters have anything better to do? Sure, they were entertainment reporters, but shouldn\u0027t they be tracking down Tom Cruise or Johnny Depp or Jennifer Aniston?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Krabbe! Miss Krabbe! Darrell Hanson, Fox News. How does it feel knowing you\u0027re going to be the queen of Alaska someday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s unbelievably alarming,\" she said into the microphone. There was a burst of laughter from the press corps, and out of the corner of her eye she saw Jenny had started rubbing her temples again. She cleared her throat. \"Actually, David and I want the king to live a long, long time. We\u0027d love it if we were never in charge of the country. He\u0027s great, and he does a terrific job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Jenny stopped rubbing. She and the prince traded a glance. The prince was smiling. \"Actually,\" Jenn said in a low voice, \"that\u0027s—that\u0027s okay. That\u0027s .. . it\u0027s very nice, actually. Keep her up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alison Smith, Miss Krabbe, Entertainment Weekly. When\u0027s the wedding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few more weeks. I guess all your invitations got lost in the mail, because we want tons of reporters to be there,\" she added wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark Spangler, Channel 10 News. Where are you honeymooning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prince\u0027s eyebrows arched in surprise, but he didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Entertainment Weekly, Miss Krabbe . . . you could go anywhere in the world . . . why New York?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? Some of the best restaurants in the world are in New York City.\" She rubbed her hands together with glee. \"And we\u0027re gonna try \u0027em all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Krabbe—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, is there pressure on you and the prince to provide an heir to the Alaskan throne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her finger at the reporter from MSNBC \"Now, now. How the hell is our sex life any of your business?\" But she said it with a smile, and it was the lead in all their stories that evening. Along with the picture of the future princess yawning with her fingers over her mouth during the prince\u0027s speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was really nice, what you said about Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the truth.\" They were touring the aquarium, along with about sixty thousand other people. The security team was, as usual, as tense as cats in a dog pound. \"I don\u0027t want to be queen. And come on, do you really want to be king? Wouldn\u0027t you rather be a prince forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankly, he had never thought about it before. It would never have occurred to him to think about it in those terms. \"It\u0027s my duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice, but I notice you didn\u0027t answer my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a stir of impatience, and quelled it. It had been a long day; no need to take it out on the pretty blonde at his side. She hadn\u0027t been born to duty, as he had. She still had the luxury of questioning fate. \"That\u0027s because it\u0027s an irrelevant question. It\u0027s my duty. It will be your duty. For what it\u0027s worth, you\u0027ll be a fine queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. For what it\u0027s worth, I don\u0027t like it when you tell me I\u0027m being irrelevant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked in surprise. She didn\u0027t sound like she was kidding. \"Noted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris! Christina!\" A strong baritone reached them, and then a piercing whistle split the air. \"Hey! Krabbe-with-a-silent-e!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in her tracks and he nearly stumbled into her. \"Stop!\" she said, seeing the security team all twitch toward their handguns. \"Let him through. I know this guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid watched as the blond, broad-shouldered man in jeans and a black T-shirt with the logo FREE MARTHA worked his way through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, who is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kurt Carlson.\" She was waving furiously at the stranger. \"You remember how I told you I could count all my lovers on one hand? That\u0027s number two. Kurt!\" she cried as he finally reached her. Her feet left the ground as he picked her up in an exuberant hug. \"How the hell are you? What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kidding?\" David could hear California surfer in the man\u0027s voice, although he had to be close to thirty. \"I had some leave from the department coming, and I read in the papers you were gonna be in Beantown. So I hopped a plane and here I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina looked disturbingly thrilled. \"You came all the way out here to see me? You big dummy, you should save your vacation time to see your mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in Greece with Stepfather Number Six. Hey,\" he added casually to David. He didn\u0027t bow, which was entirely appropriate, as the man was American. Americans, since time out of mind, did not bow, curtsey, or obey any sovereign on earth. Still, some acknowledgement of his station would have been nice. Anything instead of, \"How\u0027s it hanging, guy? I\u0027m Kurt. Chris and me go way back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was supposed to take a cruise with his mom,\" she added, \"but she stood him up to honeymoon with Stepfather Number Three. So we got to know each other. It\u0027s so great to see you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you,\" David said, interrupting another hug by sticking his hand out, forcing Kurt to shake it \"I\u0027ve heard... well... nothing about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s Chris for you. She never volunteers shit if she can help it. But boy, dynamite tattoo, eh?\" The peasant actually elbowed him in the ribs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-16.html","bookId":2789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM"}
