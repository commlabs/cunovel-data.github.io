He made sure I heard the action on the Beretta as he chambered the next round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have my gun pointed at your friend\u0027s head, Mr. Navarre. At present he can still be saved. Throw your gun into the doorway and come into the warehouse and perhaps I will reconsider my options. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheckly said something very insistent in German, an order. Kraus responded derisively in the same language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheck barked the same command again and Kraus laughed. Somewhere very far away there were sirens. The rain kept falling in my face, soaking through my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No good, Sheck,\" I yelled. \"Give it up and I\u0027ll make sure they listen to you. Let Kraus and his associates be the ones they lynch. Otherwise we\u0027re talking multiple murders and Huntsville and a bunch of guys in Luxembourg laughing their ass off about you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s it going to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One—\" Kraus started to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Chavez managed a noise, a low mumble that might\u0027ve been a scream if not for weakness and shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheck barked something else in German and Kraus yelled \"Two—\" and I gave up hope and came barrelling into the doorway to fire when guns went off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember Jean Kraus raising his Beretta toward Sheck and Sheck drawing his .41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efaster than anything I\u0027ve ever seen and both men firing. Three rapid red bubbles expanded and burst in the back of Kraus\u0027 white turtleneck. Kraus lurched backward into a forest of upright CD spools and sent them crashing to the floor. Plastic caps shot off and three CDs spilled out like metallic poker chips, slishing colourfully across the cement. Three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aftermath was incredibly quiet. The rain drummed on the corrugated metal overhead. The truck engines hummed. I swear I could hear the rattle of Milo\u0027s breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheck stared at me. His eyes were dull. He wiped the sweat off his lip with the back of his gun hand, took a step back, and stumbled against the crate where he\u0027d been hiding a moment before. There were giant sweat rings like halfmoons under the arms of his denim shirt. One of his boots had come untucked from his jeans. His hat was knocked sideways at a funny angle and he was bleeding—from the scar Allison had given him a few days ago, now burst out of its little squares of tape, and from a streak of blood on his arm, where Jean\u0027s bullet had grazed through the shirt, ripping the fabric and a layer of skin neatly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sirens were getting louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jean Kraus\u0027 body in the CDs. He was bent over the tubes of music at a funny angle, his head too far back and his chest too far out. One of the canisters had fallen into the crook of his arm so he seemed to be holding it like an oversized spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne leg was folded unnaturally behind him. His eyes were open as black and fierce as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouched next to Milo and looked into his face. I couldn\u0027t tell anything. He continued to breathe, and to bleed. The wound was in his shoulder, probably no internal organs hit. His eyes were glazed and unfocused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Sheck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was breathing shallowly, like he was trying to remember how. When he looked at me and laughed, the noise sounded more like a pained whimper, like he was getting something cauterized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can talk, son,\" he told me. \"I\u0027ll talk. Hell, I\u0027ve weathered worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sirens approached and I tended to Milo\u0027s wounds Sheckly paced around the warehouse, kicking at the pirate CDs, laughing and mumbling to Jean Kraus\u0027 corpse that he\u0027d weathered worse, like maybe if he said it a few hundred more times he might come to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday and Wednesday were a blur. I remember cops, Milo Chavez in the hospital, more cops. I remember sleeping in an interrogation room for several hours, speaking to Sam Barrera and Gene Schaeffer on several occasions and meeting Barrera\u0027s nice friends from the FBI and ATF. When I dreamt I dreamt about giving pints of blood over and over and asking for donuts and water and getting nothing but little smiley face stickers that said: I\u0027M A DONOR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke Thursday morning on the futon at 90 Queen Anne, wondering how I got there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVague memories started surfacing about a ride in the back of a mustard yellow BMW, someone who smelled like Aramis cursing my father\u0027s name as he trundled me out of the car and dragged me up the stairs and tucked me roughly into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked the crust out of my eyes. Robert Johnson was curled around my feet. The TV was on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the pretty colours and the plastic faces of anchor people. Slowly the sounds they were making became English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were recapping the story of the week, telling me things I already knew. We\u0027d had the second largest bust of pirate and bootleg audio CDs in U.S. history, right here in the Alamo City—$1.5 million netted in cash over the last two days and 350,000 titles by over ninety country artists—all precipitated by a police response to gunfire at a North Side warehouse Monday evening. Three men had been killed before police arrived. One of the victims was an Avalon County deputy who\u0027d apparently been in collusion with the pirates. The other two victims were Luxembourg nationals. A falling out among thieves, one reporter had called it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilden Sheckly, country music entrepreneur, had been taken into custody at the scene and was cooperating with authorities about his connections to the European smug gling ring. He had led Customs officials to three separate warehouses full of merchandise and cash and several boxes of automatic weapons that the ATF claimed were the first shipments of a fledgling gunrunning operation, piggybacking off the CD distribution network. Several recent murders in the San Antonio area had now been linked to the Luxembourg organization and at least one foreign national was still at large, wanted for the slaying of the Avalon County deputy Elgin Garwood. The anchorman showed the wanted man\u0027s face—the third man who\u0027d been in Jean Kraus\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBMW—and gave a name I didn\u0027t recognize. The murder weapon had been found several blocks away—a .357 calibre pistol, wiped of prints, unregistered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA search was under way for locally based talent agent, Les SaintPierre. According to Samuel Barrera, RIAA\u0027s contracted private investigator and hero of the day, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaintPierre was not a suspect in any crime. Rather, SaintPierre had disappeared while acting as an informant for the authorities and was, sadly, presumed dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Tilden Sheckly, he was a small fish. When pressed the SAPD spokesman confirmed that Sheck stood a good chance of lenient charges if, as promised, he could help authorities in several states and at least three E.U. countries with information on his Luxembourg partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned off the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed a shower, then some cold cereal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround ten o\u0027clock I called a friend of mine in the ExpressNews entertainment section and got the rest of the story. The inside scoop in music industry circles was that Les SaintPierre had actually embezzled tens of thousands from his own agency and disappeared to the Caribbean. Some said Mazatlan. Others said Brazil. Many said he\u0027d been working with the Luxembourgians. The agency he\u0027d headed had collapsed over the last forty eight hours, although one of Les\u0027 associates, Milo Chavez, had heroically confronted the pirates and blown the whole operation open. Chavez was said to be recovering nicely and putting together a lucrative deal for Miranda Daniels with Century Records. As a result of that, and the good publicity, Chavez had employment offers from several large Nashville agencies. Reportedly with Milo would came Miranda Daniels as a client and a large number of former SaintPierre talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo had apparently underestimated himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to my friend at the ExpressNews, the Miranda Daniels developmental tape featured strong material and was as good as a surefire gold record. It had a strong buzz going, whatever that meant. My friend expected the deal to go through with Century Records and Miranda to be on the Billboard charts by New Year\u0027s. He said the human interest angle really helped— first and foremost the recent tragic death of Miranda\u0027s brother, who had written some of her best songs. The murder of her former fiddle player helped too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tabloids are eating this up,\" Carlon McAffrey told me. \"You don\u0027t happen to have an in with this Chavez guy, do you? Or Daniels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did tai chi on the back porch until almost noon. Halfway through the long form my muscles started to burn the right way again. The vacuous sick feeling in my stomach faded. Once I got into the sword form I could almost concentrate again. The phone rang just as I was completing the last section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside and caught it on the third ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly Arguello said, \"Allen Meissner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a pen, stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled one out of the crack in the ironing board. Kelly rattled off a social security number, a Texas driver\u0027s license number, a flight number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meissner applied for the social security number two months ago,\" she said, \"at age fortyfive. Got his license at DMV two weeks ago, then plane tickets to New York on American, booked for tomorrow. Good trick considering the guy died in \u002795. Meissner used to be an inhouse auditor for Texas Instruments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did say before Friday, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You found him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly laughed. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to tell you, chico loco. Your client\u0027s going to be happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the flight number. \"When was this reservation made?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yesterday. Hey—this is good news, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. \"Absolutely. You\u0027re incredible, Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying to tell you that, too. Now about that dinner—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to Ralph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please, not that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned down against the ironing board and ran my fingers into my hair. I closed my eyes and listened to the slight crackle of the phone line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I mean you should call him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent a few silent moments trying to interpret my tone. \"What happened? What\u0027d you two get into this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just need to call him, okay? Even better, get down here. Spend a day with him, okay? He needs—I don\u0027t know, I think he needs to be reminded you\u0027re around. Some niecely influence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Niecely is a word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. English Ph.D. here. Back off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the thanks I get for helping you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sighed. \"I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll also come to see you.\" She said it like it was the deadliest threat she could make. I smiled in spite of myself. \"Bueno?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bueno,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e56\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Friday morning before I spoke to Milo and Miranda again. I never found out how Miranda\u0027s things got picked up from the safe house on the South Side—Ralph just handled it somehow. Ralph didn\u0027t call me. That told me something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo and Miranda arranged to meet me at the Sunset Cafe for breakfast. Gladys the exreceptionist for the ex Les SaintPierre Agency set up the appointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sunset Cafe was the kind of place you\u0027d drive right by—an adobe oneroom shack on the ridge rising from Broadway, wedged between an art gallery and an insurance office. Despite its name, the cocina opened early and closed early, serving egg and bacon and came guisada tacos and strong coffee to blue collars. When I pulled the VW up the steep driveway and into the tiny parking lot, Milo\u0027s Jeep was already there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Daniels\u0027 brown and white Ford pickup was also in the lot, minus the horse trailer. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-50.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
