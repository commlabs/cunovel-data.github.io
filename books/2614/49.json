Calm down,” Emil said softly, taking hold of me. “You are distraught and exhausted from the journey. This has been a shock to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to see Glynis. I want to see her now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew, the dear girl is disfigured and does not like to venture out in the daylight,” Maria said soothingly. “You must understand her predicament. She will come this evening to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How badly is she disfigured?” I asked with a sob in my voice. My legs felt leaden and I stumbled backward into a chair. “What is wrong with my sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria drew in a sharp breath, looking toward her husband. Stephen sat down next to me and leaned forward, his expression full of sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew, your sister was badly mangled in the accident. The carriage plummeted off the pass into the river. Glynis was thrown free, but her face was badly torn by the jagged rocks in the river. She has healed, but her face is disfigured. She insists that no one can look upon her face but Count Dracula. He takes very good care of her and she loves him for it. When she comes tonight, she will be heavily veiled. You must not try and raise the veils or she will become very irate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words horrified me and struck a knife deep into my heart. I felt tears come to my eyes and I covered my face with my hand. Emil leaned over me, patting my shoulder in an effort to comfort me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am sorry to tell you of this unfortunate news, but you left England before Count Dracula had a chance to fully inform you of her condition. Glynis was reluctant to let you know the full extent of her injury. She has been very distraught over her appearance,” Stephen continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she is a fine, strong young woman,” Maria assured me. “She needs your love, not your pity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you seen her?” I asked, looking up at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria shook her head, her long hair falling about her face prettily. “No, no, my husband visits with them, but I have yet to see her. My husband has told me all that has happened and my heart breaks for her. But do you not see? She has found some measure of happiness with the Count.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, Andrew, we must be glad for that,” Emil said quickly. “We must be glad for any happiness she may have now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, my reddened eyes rising up to stare into the gentle expression in the eyes of Maria Ramsay. “She will come here tonight?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, she will,” Maria answered gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until then, you must rest. We have rooms prepared for you. We must insist on you staying with us while you are in Buda. I think the stress of having visitors around her would be unhealthy for your sister,” Stephen said in his calm, monotone voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Sir Stephen. You are quite kind,” Emil declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI numbly nodded in agreement. I was overwrought and felt as if I wanted to flee the mansion and rush to my sister’s side. But I forced myself to be civil and calm and said, “Yes, we cannot thank you enough for your hospitality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is our pleasure,” Stephen assured us with a small smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod forgive me, but in that moment, I did not trust him. I felt the worst that I could imagine had befallen my dear sister. I hope and pray to God that I am wrong. But I sit now in desperate anticipation waiting the evening to fall so that I may once more lay eyes up on my sister and know that she is truly safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Lady Glynis Wright-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuda, Hungary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awoke with a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew is here,” I whispered. I felt it to the core of my very soul, if I have one that is, and flung back the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly dissolved into a mist and slipped through the crack in the wall of our secret chamber. I solidified in the foyer of the house, startling one of our maids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is Vlad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madam, your husband is waiting for you in your room,” she whispered, then dashed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trembling with delight and excitement. I knew my brother was in the city for I could feel his presence reaching out to me. A smile gracing my lips, I hurried up the stairs to my bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much has happened since I have arrived in the city. It is as if my fortune changed as soon as I arrived here. I am now living in a lovely house, I have fallen madly in love with the mysterious Ignatius, and now my brother was waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is as if I have finally broken free from my dark prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I ran up the steps, these thoughts were in my mind and I felt giddy with the happiness I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glynis!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad’s voice was sharp and impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly ascended the remaining steps and hurried into my room. Vlad was waiting for me in quite the restless mood. He was clad in a fashionable suit and his hair and mustache were neatly trimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First you are stalked by hunters and do not return until the next night. Then you awaken late. Is this how a small measure of freedom corrupts you?” he asked testily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am sorry, Master. Please, forgive me,” I said quickly, my eyes properly downcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved one hand at me. “Hurry and get dressed. Your brother is waiting for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not help but smile. Vlad had already laid out a light blue dress and veil for me. We had discussed having me dress in mourning, but Vlad had feared it would upset my brother too much if he saw me as a completely desolate creature. We wanted him to pity me, but believe I had found some happiness. I found it all quite hysterical. Vlad slapped me when I had laughed a little too long at the thought of him being portrayed as a hero of our sordid fake love story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will remember what you are to say,” Vlad said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, my darling husband,” I answered quite sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at me, then turned his attention to the view outside my window. My maids came to my aid and quickly helped me to dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are an insolent creature,” Vlad said after a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shall try not to be,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked at me coolly. “I think it would be quite difficult for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled ever so innocently at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is your brother like your father or your mother?” Vlad asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, he is quite a bit like me,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Vlad looked pensive, then shrugged. “I am sure I can deal with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurriedly twisted and pinned up my hair into a neat style. “Well, he does put on a very calm façade. But be warned, he has a fiery temper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad turned to regard me. “I have dealt with you quite well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to fuss with the veil. “Yes, but you will not be able to beat him into submission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad snarled at me, then regained his calm. He stood quite still for a few moments then walked over to me. Only his green eyes now betrayed his anxiousness. He began to help me arrange the heavy veil over my face and I could feel the trembling of his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really do want this to work,” I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to go to England,” Vlad responded. “I will not be kept a prisoner forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if my own words were coming from his mouth and it sent chills down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad stood back and surveyed his creation. He smiled with satisfaction and reached out his hand. “Come, Glynis. Let us go greet our future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am an impatient creature by my very nature. I do not deal well with anticipation. I felt as if I would explode at any moment from the excitement I felt as our carriage wound its way through the streets of Buda to Sir Stephen’s estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not help myself and began to cry softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad glanced at me, attempting to study my face through the thick veil. My sniffling gave me away and he snorted with contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Control yourself,” he ordered shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to fight down my tears of pure joy, but I was sure my bright smile could be seen beaming through the thick folds of my lace veil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage turned into the drive to Sir Stephen’s home and I sat forward in anticipation. My heart began to beat wildly within me. It was such a human reaction in a vampiric body that it surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few moments were a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unlatched the carriage door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew raced down the steps toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flung myself into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we were locked in an embrace so tight, I am quite sure he could scarcely breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glynis, Glynis, Glynis,” he sobbed in my ear as he clutched me to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew,” I wailed, my voice cracking with emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy elder brother kissed my cheek through the veil and rocked me tenderly in his arms, murmuring my name over and over again. Joy, so complete and all encompassing, filled me so that the world around me disappeared. All I could feel was my brother’s love warming my soul and his arms holding me. In those wonderful moments, I felt not only his arms around me, but also my father’s, mother’s, and May’s. For a brief instant, my family was whole and complete. The love we had shared filled me and banished the darkness within with its wonderful light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew, Andrew, you are here,” I whispered emotionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came for you, Glynis,” Andrew answered. “I came to bring you home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutched him desperately and whispered, “I want to go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angeline is waiting for us there. And the baby, John. You must see him, Glynis. He has the exact same shade of red hair as you do. We named him John Andrew Glenn. Glenn after you, Glynis. You must see him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to,” I said through my tears. My face was so wet the veil was sticking to my cheeks. “I want to go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we shall, dear wife, when we go to live in England,” Vlad’s voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a knife sliced through the happy haze surrounding Andrew and me. My brother became aware of the imposing man dressed all in black for the first time. His blue eyes swept over the Count. I held onto my brother tightly, daring not to look at Vlad. His voice sounded strained, and I knew I had made a serious mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am Dracula,” Vlad said in his somber tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes. Count Dracula, the man who saved my sister,” Andrew said in a tightly controlled voice. It was vividly clear that he did not like the Count. It was an instant and intense dislike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am her husband,” Vlad insisted firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that Andrew was trying to peer through the heavy veil into my eyes. “Glynis, did you really marry him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to scream out in protest and tell Andrew all that I had endured, but I bit my lip and only nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew took a deep breath, then extended his hand to Vlad. “Then I must welcome you to the family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad took Andrew’s hand and smiled, flashing his very white teeth. “It is a pleasure to finally know my brother -in -law.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you coming in?” a beautiful woman called out from the doorway from where she stood with Sir Stephen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it will be more comfortable inside,” Sir Stephen insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew kept a hold on my hand and led me up the stairs to the doorway. Vlad followed us. I glanced back to see his face was impassive, but his eyes were stormy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached the doorway, I felt as though I had impacted with a wall. Andrew passed over the threshold easily, but I found myself rooted to the doorstep. Vlad came up behind me and glared at Sir Stephen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come along, Glynis,” Andrew said, his hand still holding mine, clearly unsure of why I was reticent to enter the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I should go in with my husband,” I said quickly, darting a panicked glance at Vlad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman, who I now realized must be Maria, Stephen’s wife, stood waiting for us in the hallway looking quite bewildered. Stephen, the simpering fool, simply looked afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad caught Stephen’s gaze and I felt his dark powers swirl up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvite her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the silent order and Sir Stephen gulped in response. He surged forward, raising his hand outward. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-49.html","bookId":2614,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM"}
