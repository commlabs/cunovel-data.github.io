If I saw them, I’d probably have a breakdown right there in the halls, something that hadn’t happened since the funeral. Yeah, I liked to think I was stronger now, more in control, but I wasn’t taking chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in front, just behind the driver, and kept my head down during the ride. I spoke to no one, and I was the first to exit, my steps quick as my backpack thumped against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused in front of the building, my eyes wide and my stomach churning. So. Many. Kids. Some were tall, some were short. Black, white. Boy, girl. Rich, poor. Preppy, stoned. Skinny, not so skinny. Clothed, practically naked. Each one huddled in a group, beyond excited to be together again. Everyone seemed to be talking over someone else and laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building itself was sprawling and kind of creepy, because wow—Tigers took their school colors seriously. Never had I seen so much black and gold. Black brick was interspaced with gold brick. There was a wealth of trees, the trunks painted black and the leaves painted gold. There was a cement walkway, and black-and-gold tiger paws led to the front doors, where metal detectors stood guard. Someone had anchored tiger ears on the sides and whiskers in the middle to give the detectors faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote to self: Never talk badly about jungle cats. I’d probably get my head dunked in the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped by the front office and asked for a map, only to be sighed at and pointed to a fat stack of them on the counter. I grabbed one and muttered, “Thanks.” I had my schedule already, so it was just a matter of finding my way. I’d never been good with directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I was walking away, a woman strode out of the back office, spotted me and changed her course, heading straight for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out a well-manicured hand. “You’re Alice Bell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali,” I said as we shook. Her grip was strong. Too strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m the principal here. Dr. Wright. And do not think you’ll get away with calling me Ms. Wright, Wright or Hey Lady. I earned my title and you will use it. Understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I looked her over as discreetly as possible. Dark brown hair framed a pretty face. She had olive-toned skin, brown eyes that practically flashed the words I mean business, and a cupid’s bow mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you need anything,” she said, already moving off, “don’t hesitate to let one of my assistants know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I will—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t hear me, because she was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way into a hall that was plastered with Tigers Rule posters and majorly congested, kids rushing in every direction, a (black-and-gold) beach ball being tossed around, laughter echoing. I must have been walking too slowly, because several people tried to mow me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an act of self-preservation, I pressed into a wall of lockers. Soon the crowd would thin and I could navigate my way without incident. As I waited, I tried not to think about my old school and the fact that, after my last class, I wouldn’t be walking to the nearest elementary school to pick up…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNope, not going there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze shot from the floor to a beautiful brunette, who stood front and center in a group of girls. “Kat! I mean, Mad Dog.” I was so happy to discover a familiar face, I did something I hadn’t done all summer. I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back, looking genuinely happy to see me, and waved me over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the distance, and she threw her arms around me as if we were long-lost friends. “Well, well, look what the Kat dragged in. Get it? Of course you do. I only make awesome jokes. But enough of my brilliant banter. I’m so glad you’re here!” Her gaze slid over me, and she gave me another grin, this one sly. “Look at you, total chili pepper hot. I love it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lie, surely. I had on ratty sneakers, ripped jeans and the oldest tee I owned. The fabric was so frayed, I looked like I—gag—wore fringe. I just hadn’t felt like getting dressed up, as if I had something to celebrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe therapist my grandparents had made me see would have said I was punishing myself for living when the rest of my family had died. (If she had uttered those words just one more time, I would have hacked off my ears and left them with her.) I’d already figured that out on my own, thank you. That didn’t change how I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” Kat prompted. “Aren’t you going to tell me how good \u0026nbsp;I look?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze roved from top to bottom. “You don’t look good. You look amazing,” I added before she could pout. She wore glittery shoes, Miss Me hip-huggers and a skintight black top. Dark hair fell in pretty waves over one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gold star for Ali,” she said. “Now, then. Allow me to make introductions. Ladies, this is Ali, a very special friend of mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened, thinking she meant to tell them where we’d met, but she didn’t and I could have hugged her all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali, this is Reeve, Poppy and Wren.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO-kay. No Janes, Beths, or Kellys here. “Hello,” I said, sounding as lame as always. The girls were as flawless as Kat, with stunning faces you’d usually find only in magazines. They wore drool-worthy outfits, also found only in magazines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagazines. Yeah. That’s the only thing that made any sense. Kat had picked each girl out of Flawless Friends Forever, I’m sure. In comparison, I felt frumpy and way outclassed, like I’d been selected from Homeless Dogs Weekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to meet you,” said Wren, a gorgeous black girl with the most amazing caramel eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any friend of Kat’s…” said Poppy, a freckled redhead surely destined to marry a prince or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m throwing a party this weekend.” Reeve flicked her dark hair over one shoulder. Her features were striking, bold, and her skin the most beautiful sun-dusted color of bronze. “Just a little get-together to celebrate surviving our first week of school. Well, our first three days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did school always start in the middle of the week?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to come,” she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, uh—hmm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d never been to a party, but I’d certainly heard a lot about the ones my friends had attended. Therefore I knew that 1) I’d be stuck in an overcrowded house with people I barely knew, 2) I’d be stuck in an overcrowded house with drunk people I barely knew, because there would be drinking—not only had my friends told me about that part, but my mother had forced me to watch enough after-school specials to fry a thousand brain cells—and 3) it would take place at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, all I’d wanted was to go out at night. I would have given \u0026nbsp;anything for a simple moonlit stroll. Arm? Leg? Why not my soul?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow? Even the thought terrified me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’ll definitely be there,” Kat said. “I’ll make sure of it. Now, get, get. Ali and I need private time to catch up.” She kissed each girl on the cheek and sent them all on their ways before returning her attention to me. “So, you received your schedule, yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the fact that she had just guaranteed my party attendance. No reason to hurt her feelings with a belligerent (and childish) \u0026nbsp;never, ever, you can’t make me go! “Yes.” Having memorized the blocks, I rattled off my classes and prayed we had at least one together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rock on! We’ll have lunch and last block to plan our takeover attempt on the school. I’ve already decided. Me and my girls are ruling. Now, I’ll walk you to first period. You’re two buildings over so it’s gonna be a hike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you over there, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I’m here.” She hitched her thumb at the door only a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the clock at the far end of the hall. We had six minutes until the tardy bell rang. “Won’t you be late to your own class?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but don’t worry.” Grinning that sly little grin of hers, she twined her arm through mine. “This is my humanitarian deed of the day. Besides, you’ll owe me. And yes, I always collect. Ask anyone. There’s not a single person in this school who doesn’t owe me a favor. True story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs tiny as she was, she had no problem pushing her way through the crowds, telling people off or flipping them off when they did or said something she didn’t like. But she kept up a steady chatter with me, telling me everything I “needed to know to survive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s a skank. He’s a player. He’s cute but almost OD’d last year, so he’s a bad bet. She’s a two-faced, lying, cheating witch. That’s right, Trina, I’m talking to you,” she shouted. “By the way,” she added just for me, “Trina cusses, which means cussing is trashy, which means my golden rule is to never cuss. I have class. Unlike Trina, the skank of Birmingham.” That last part was, of course, shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half expected the pretty but, well, somewhat masculine Trina to fly across the hall and introduce Kat’s teeth to her fist, but Trina just fronted and moved on with a glare that promised vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO-kay. New note to self: never mess with Trina. Her tank was regulation, but still managed to show off her muscular arms and tats. Her hair was chopped to just below her ears, and there were scars stretching across the back of her neck. Like, scars that resembled teeth marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I really needed to stop rubbernecking, or I’d paralyze myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s gay but in denial,” Kat continued, as though nothing had happened, “so just a heads-up not to try and tap that. Now his friend over there is loaded, but he’s a total douche. Oh, and she’s so snotty you’ll need Kleenex just to talk to her. Actually, just pretend that entire group has the plague, and you’ll be the better for it. She’s not bad. He’s—crap!” She ground to a stop, forcing me to do the same. “Laugh like I just said something amazingly hilarious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaugh? Seriously? Did I even remember how?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slapped my arm and whispered fiercely, “Laugh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so I forced out a laugh. I’m embarrassed to admit I sounded like a frog had jumped into my throat and played bongos on my voice box. Even Kat was horrified, her mouth hanging open so wide that I could see her tonsils. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-7.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
