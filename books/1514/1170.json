They were well aware of Mu Di’s strength. In fact, unless he encountered a top-tier expert who had stepped into the Reincarnation stage, he would have a high chance of victory.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong smiled. However, he did not elaborate. Instead, all he did was to stare intently at that black figure.

As he stepped forward, dazzling energy waves spread from behind him like glowing halos.

Within a short instant, they transformed into a palm sized nine coloured light ring. There were brilliant and dazzling colours on that light ring.

Clearly, Mu Di had completely unleashed the Reincarnation Power that he had came into contact with.

Meanwhile, there was a cold glint gathering within his eyes. In the next moment, his body suddenly transformed into a bright ray of light and shot forward.

Then, he withdrew his blade and stood still. His blade had just entered its scabbard when Mu Di, who was standing behind him, suddenly trembled.
