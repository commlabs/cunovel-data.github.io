Her family faded. Together they were only two, under the stars and the rising full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms over her shoulders, her green eyes locked onto his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice. Yuri’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to chase real tail? You want the real thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDancing. Intoxicating smell of woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri’s voice, still calling, but more . . . howling than calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to live life? Howl at the moon, man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that’s how it seemed, as he spun with Anastasia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want it?” she asked. “You want a natural life? A simple, honest life? A free life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t think too hard about that? Why should he? The answer had been hidden in his heart for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a real man, this life is the best,” she said, grabbing his head, pulling his hair. “For you, my mate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was picking up who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid it matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey danced and Prime opened his senses while turning down his analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point the physical urges became too much and he had to have her. Damn the lack of privacy. Damn the family. Damn the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ripped their clothing. Their own. Each others. It was all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords became sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTastes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePull hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLick skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel the air, the moving air, the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel the real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowl!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, what was he doing? What was Anastasia becoming? What was the biting doing to—stop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop thinking. Feel. Go with it, truth, life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowl!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for Prime to become Primeval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHair, sprouting. Fangs, growing. Claws, extending. Nose, blossoming. Eyes, sharpening. Ears, encompassing. Body, transforming. Becoming a better . . . being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for Primeval to take his mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn all fours, hunching, biting, howling, coming, with the scent of blood spilled from the sex for the first time. An honest mating. The best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning through the night, howling again, with wind, with his true family, his pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe belonged. He had his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had his mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had his pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a long-term relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrimeval howled with satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE GARDEN, THE MOON, THE WALL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAMANDA DOWNUM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghosts follow Sephie to work again that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stand outside the windows of the bookstore, staring in with hollow eyes—more of them now than a few days ago. She tries to ignore them. At least they never come inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of them, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light dims as she’s shelving books, and Sephie turns to find her ex-boyfriend grinning down at her, pink filming his long ivory teeth. He tilts his head, shows her the still-wet ruin a bullet made of the left side of his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands tingle with adrenaline shock as the smell of his blood coats her tongue—copper sweetness, and beneath that the familiar salt-musk of his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wink and he’s gone, and the air smells like books and dust and air freshener again. Sephie wobbles, and the stack of books in her arms teeters and falls, hardbacks and trades thumping and thwapping one by one, echoing in the afternoon quiet. No blood stains the worn green carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third time this week. Cursing, she crouches to pick up the books, and pauses as she reads the nearest title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLycanthropy: An Encyclopedia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb always was a smart-ass—she shouldn’t expect that to change because he’s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Anna calls from across the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she thinks. Not even a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky darkens as they close, October nearly over and autumn chewing the days shorter and shorter. Purple eases into charcoal, and the grinning jack-o’-lantern moon rises over the jagged Dallas skyline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon doesn’t bother her, never mind Caleb and his lousy jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSephie lights a cigarette as Anna sets the alarm and locks the back door. Her hands shake, the itch in her veins more than nicotine can ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to get some coffee?” Anna asks, pocketing her keys and pulling out her own cigarettes. Her nails are orange and black to match her Halloween hair. Her lighter rasps, and the smell of cloves drifts through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSephie swallows, her mouth gone dry. The shakes are coming on for real, her stomach cramping. “That’d be nice, but I need to run some errands. Maybe some other time.” She likes the bookstore better than any of the other jobs she’s had, and doesn’t want to get fired because someone thinks she’s a junkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not like she can tell them the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” Anna says, waving as she turns toward her car. “See you tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. ’Night.” Sephie ducks down the alley toward the street, trying not to think about Anna’s bemused little smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight will be bad—she hears it in the hollow roar of traffic, sees it in the halos bleeding off the street lamps. But cold sweat prickles her scalp, her neck, and chills crawl up and down her back; she can’t wait another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunching her shoulders, she slides into the ebb and flow of downtown streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few blocks everything’s okay. The night hums and chatters, traffic and voices, the cacophony of city-noises. The air tastes of exhaust and asphalt, the sewer-stench of the Trinity fading now that summer’s passed. She catches a whiff of decay, of meat, and saliva pools on her tongue. But it’s only a dead dog, not what she needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it happens, that sideways lurch in the pit of her stomach, and she’s alone on the sidewalk. No more neon and shining glass, no more noise. Dusty brick and stone instead, grime-blind windows and the moon grinning overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s learned not to stop, not to listen to their whispers. Keep walking, eyes on the sidewalk—don’t look at those pale faces peering out of the shadows, bruised and bloody or just empty, eyes burning with a junkie’s aching need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knows the feeling, all too well, but she can’t help them. She can barely help herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nose wrinkles against the smell of this place. The city stinks, but at least it’s a living stench. This is dry bones and dust, old tombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind that sighs from black alley-mouths is worse—sulfur and ammonia, sickness and pain. It aches like a bruise when it touches her, makes her eyes water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer footfalls echo as she lengthens her stride. It will pass. It always does. She has to keep moving, out of the between-places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she’s a between-thing now, and she may never leave this place behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breeze eddies past her, and Sephie stumbles to a halt. Rose gardens and evergreen, the smell of evenings as summer melts into autumn. The smell of her dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent leaks from under the door of a narrow shop, its windows curtained and dull. She reaches for the knob with a trembling hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her stomach cramps again, and already the braver ghosts are moving toward her, murmuring, pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns and runs, and doesn’t stop until the world slips back to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobet \u0026amp; Cask Funeral Services is long closed, but a light burns in the back. Sephie crouches in the shadow of a hedge, holly pricking her back as she finishes her last cigarette and tries to slow her breathing. Her legs cramp from exercise, but that’s nothing to the pain in her gut. She wipes clammy sweat from her face and drags her fingers through the curling cowlicked mess of her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter waits by the back door, even though she’s early. Hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched, eyes flitting back and forth—he looks like a really bad spy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should start smoking,” she says, moving out of the dark. “It’d look more natural.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerks, presses his back to the door. The smell of his fear cuts through the muggy night and Sephie’s stomach growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—” He swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing. “Come inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe always invites her in; he’s read too many books. She follows him down the corridor, down the stairs to the morgue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air smells of chemicals and death, and she rubs her arms against crawling goosebumps. Her sweat gels in the cold, sticking her shirt to her back. A body lies on a metal table, and her stomach clenches again. Peter glances at her, blue eyes narrowing, like he thinks she’ll start gnawing on an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s not sure what would happen if he weren’t here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens a refrigerator, takes out a lidded plastic bowl. “It’s heart, and liver, and some other things . . . A car crash, so I could take a little more than usual.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This guy?” She nods toward the corpse in his funeral suit, wrinkled face coated in makeup that can’t simulate living color, no matter how skillfully it’s applied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, he had a heart attack. The accident was a few days ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSephie smiles, close-lipped. “Thank you.” She tugs a roll of bills out of her pocket, trades it for the container. He tried to give the money back, once, but she makes him keep it. She’s afraid he’ll ask for something else if she doesn’t. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-with-the-pack/page-48.html","bookId":2622,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:49 PM"}
