Jiuhua,\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Milky Way hung within black waters, with nine lovely lotuses appearing within.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI wish to wave my hand about, who is willing to follow me?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSir, you are the host of this party, and thus now I lie relaxed amidst the clouds.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eLi Bai\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMt. Jiuhua was forty li southwest of Anhui province’s Qingyang city. It was next to where the two cities of Jingxian and Lingyang were during the Han dynasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Wu kingdom established the Lincheng county. After the Sui dynasty collapsed, the Tang dynasty created the Qingyang prefecture. The mountain had already become famous and was considered part of Chizhou prefecture. The mountain was five li north of the county, past the Plum Family Ridge and bordered by Guichi province.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMt. Jiuhang was north of Linyang, east of Qiupu, was five small streams south of Datong, and bordered the Twin Dragon-Mouth Peaks to the west. In ancient days, it was named Mt. Jiuzi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tang dynasty’s Li Bai toured Mt. Jiuzi. When he saw the mountain peak, which appeared like a blooming, nine-petaled lotus, he changed its name to Mt. Jiuhua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is recorded in books that “the old name was Mt. Jiuzi. The Tang dynasty poet saw that the nine peaks of the mountain appeared like they had been whittled into the shape of lotus petals, and thus changed the name to Mt. Jiuhua.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also recorded in the annals of Qingyang province that “the mountain is forty li west of the county. There are forty eight famous peaks, fourteen crags, five caves, eleven ridges, eighteen springs, and two river sources. There are a number of other different, unique stone platforms, ponds, ravines, and brooks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Knowing and Doing Becoming One’, Wang Yangming, once studied within the reaches of this mountain. Throughout the ages, the place has held equal fame with Li Bai’s study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe god of poetry, Li Bai, ‘changed Mt. Jiuzi to Mt. Jiuhua’ in an orderly fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e“…the Grand Historian’s tour of the south was described but not recorded. This matter definitely happened as the old men say, but no virtuous man of ability recorded it. Celestial spirits inspired and moved his pen, causing him to scratch out the old name and bestow the new one, Mt. Jiuhua. Next, he paid a visit to the men nearby, travelling with them to Xiahou Hui’s home. They sat down upon the snow from the pines, and left behind two or three lines for posterity.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was their poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eThe amazing west is divided in two, Mt. Lingshan opens to Mt. Jiushan.\u003c/i\u003e” – Li Bai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eThe layered mountain holds back the tardy sun, half the cliffs are covered with bright, rosy clouds of dawn\u003c/i\u003e.” – Gao Ji.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eThe accumulated snow gleams across the gully, and the joyful sun flies across the cliff\u003c/i\u003e.” –Wei Quanyu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eThe dazzling, jade-like trees, a vast mist floats about\u003c/i\u003e.” – Li Bai\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mt. Jiuhua wasn’t just a place for poets. It was also chief amongst the places where Buddhists held their sacred rites to honor Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sutra of the Ten Wheels of Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha: “Tranquil endurance as still as the earth. Quiet pondering as deep as a deep depository.” Thus, the name taken was ‘Ksitigarbha’, meaning ‘earth depository’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was recorded in the Mahayana sutras: “Upon a request by the World Honored One, Ksitigarbha pledged that until he had saved all the living things of the Six Paths, he would not become a Buddha. He often submerged his own body into hell, and had saved countless lives from torment. Thus, he is called the ‘Patriarch of the Nether World.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two rolls to the sutra of the Original Vows of the Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha. It is very difficult to interpret this Tang scripture, but within it, this was recorded: “The Buddha ascended to Trayamatrimsa Heaven to expound on the dharma to his mother. Next, he called Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha to him and made him the eternal ‘Patriarch of the Nether World’, so as to eventually bring all the people in the world to ascend to the highest joy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sutra talked a great deal about hell and how to pursue merit to avoid it. It was a mourning sutra of Buddhism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sutra also discussed how Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha rescued countless souls and brought them to salvation. He did not make an empty vow when he promised to not become a Buddha until his great work was done. And thus, the name of this sutra was the ‘Original Vows of the Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, not only was the sword skill of the ‘Mt. Jiuhua Sword Sect’ exquisite, it also possessed the romanticism of poets and the mysterious secrets of Buddhism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were seven great sword sects in the martial world. Mt. Jiuhua wasn’t actually one of them, because they were always very few disciples of the Mt. Jiuhua sect, and even more rarely did they travel abroad in the martial world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong ago, the martial world conflated the Mt. Jiuhua Sect with the Netherworld Sect. Both of them worshipped the same two founders. The first was Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha. The other the dissolute man of poetry and wine, the eternal, unmatchable Li Bai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was said that the lay Buddhist Qing Lian was not only a god of poetry, but that also a god of the sword. The Mt. Jiuhua Sword Technique was passed down from him. After hundreds on hundreds of years, another amazing hero appeared in the martial world, Li Mubai. He was also a direct descendant of the Mt. Jiuhua sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese legends made the Mt. Jiuhua sect even more mysterious and mystical in the hearts of the people of the martial world. The whereabouts of the disciples of the Mt. Jiuhua sect became even more secretive, and in recent years, they seemed to have vanished from the martial world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut none of these things were the reason for Fu Hongxue’s shock. What shocked him was Master Ruyi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi wore a white robe, and was barefoot in grass shoes. A bald head, a solemn expression, and light radiating from the pupils. Master Ruyi was, without a doubt, a Buddhist of extremely great learning. A female Buddhist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as though she were already in middle age. Her figure was moderately covered, her appearances was upright, her bearing was respectable and polite. There was nothing particularly attractive about the solemn expression on her face, and even less was there something which should surprise people. No matter who looked at her, they would only see a middle-aged nun who strictly followed Buddhist rules, who was not one bit different from the thousands on thousands of other nuns in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in Fu Hongxue’s eyes, the situation was totally different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough her appearance was ordinary and sedate, her jade-white hands were as beautiful as spring scallions, so soft as to appear boneless. She was barefoot in grass shoes, not wearing any socks, revealing a pair of feet which were as white as the snow, so beautiful they could dazzle. Her white Buddhist robe was spacious and soft, without a speck of dust on it, concealing a large part of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one would fantasize about what the body and figure of a middle-aged nun would be like, underneath her Buddhist robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fu Hongxue couldn’t help but think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spotlessly white Buddhist robe on the railing. The beautiful, lush body in the bathing pool. The groans and moans in the darkness. The warm, smooth embrace. And those two hands which brought him into the dream world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, he actually couldn’t separate this outwardly-moral appearing nun with the ripe woman, filled with longing, from last night. Although he forbade himself from thinking about it, he still couldn’t help himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had already become indifferent to all things, unmoved and untouched, but this extremely solemn, rule-abiding nun caused his heart to be thrown into chaos. He could already feel his lips go dry, his heart rate increase, as though there was no way for him to control it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi only dully glanced at him. Her dignified, solemn face did not reveal a single trace of an expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue almost couldn’t resist rushing over there, tearing open her Buddhist robe to see if she was that woman from last night. But he still managed to force himself to stay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to hear her ask, “So this would be the world famous benefactor, Fu Hongxue?” [Benefactor is a term which monks and nuns use to address secular people.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to hear his own voice reply, “Yes. I am Fu Hongxue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo looked at them. The expression in her eyes was crafty and sly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she already know about them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly laughed. “Master, you have been stationed long at Mt. Jiuhua. I didn’t imagine that even you would have heard of Hero Fu’s name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “Although this humble nun is located in distant lands, I am not totally unaware of the matters of the martial world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Master, didn’t you meet him before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi mumbled to herself, then actually nodded. “It seems that I saw him once. Only, at that time, it was already very dark, and I did not see him clearly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo laughed. “But although you did not see him clearly, master, he definitely saw you very clearly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo’s laughter became even more mysterious. “Because this Hero Fu has perfect night vision. Even in the darkness, he can clearly perceive each hair on an animal’s body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as though a strange expression had appeared on Master Ruyi’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s heart was sinking as well. Last night, in the dark room, he hadn’t actually seen her clearly. He had only faintly seen the outlines of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t realized this up til now. Only now did he realize that his eyesight had unknowingly suffered damage. That must have happened after he saw the old man in the iron cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that within that old man’s eyes, there was a power which could make others slow and sluggish? Why wouldn’t he allow Fu Hongxue to see the woman in the darkness? Why was she waiting for him in the darkness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last two witnesses were also invited in by Gongzi Yu, but Fu Hongxue actually didn’t notice who they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart was thrown in turmoil again. He couldn’t forget the events of last night, nor could he turn a living woman into a tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoss Chen’s grief and pain and Ni Baofeng’s hatred-filled gaze suddenly became intolerable to him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that scarlet red sword. How could this sword be in Gongzi Yu’s hands? If the sword was in his hands, where was Yan Nanfei?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat type of mysterious relationship was there, exactly, between these two? Why was it that Gongzi Yu, up to this very moment, was still refusing to reveal his true features?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe torch fires rose up high. The stone platform was as bright as daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue finally walked on to the stone platform. He tightly gripped his sabre, even more tightly than normal. When he was sorrowful, vexed, suffering, or helpless, only this sabre had the power to stabilize him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo him, this sabre was far more important than a blind man’s walking stick. There was already a strange emotional bond between him and the sabre, one which no person in the world could ever understand. Not only did they understand each other, they also trusted each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu stared at him. One word at a time, he slowly said, “You can draw your sabre at any time, now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the sword was already in his hand. Anybody could tell that he had even more confidence than Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue unexpectedly said, “You can’t just wait a bit longer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cynical look appeared in Gongzi Yu’s eyes. “I can wait. Only, no matter how long I wait, victory and defeat will not be affected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not listen to his words. He suddenly turned around, left the stone platform, and walked to Master Ruyi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi lifted her head up to look at him, appearing surprised and uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Master, from whence do you come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “I come from Mt. Jiuhua.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Where did the Prince come from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “He came from Silla.” [Part of modern Korea.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Why did he give up his riches and honor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “To abandon all to study Buddhism.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Since he sacrificed everything to study Buddhism, why did he vow not to become a Buddha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “Only to bring all life to salvation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression had become peaceful, and her expression had become even more solemn. But others couldn’t understand at all what they were talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was, when the emperor of the Tang dynasty sent out troops to help quell a rebellion in Silla, the prince of Silla, Jin Qiaojue, gave up his glories and came to China to study Buddhism. By himself, he scaled Mt. Jiuhua, where he cultivated himself and meditated. All the deeds he had done in his life were identical to those done by the Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha. In the eleventh year of Emperor Tang Dezong’s reign, he ascended to Parinirvana. Before departing, his appearance was exactly the same as that of the original appearance of the Bodhisatvva Ksitigarbha. According to legends, he left behind his flesh to future generations, as his body became a pagoda at the peak of the mountain. The pagoda was exquisitely made in all aspects, resplendent in gold and jade, with copper vases in each corner, the colors of cinnabar and jadeite. Within them, there was holy oil which can grant people peace and and tranquility. The disciples of the Mt. Jiuhua sect carried this oil with them at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue asked again, “Where is the Prince now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi said, “He is still at Mt. Jiuhua.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “The Prince will bring all life to salvation. How about you, Master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruy said, “This humble nun has that desire as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Since that is the case, I hope that you, master, will give me your blessing and allow my heart to become pure and tranquil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi’s hands folded together. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really did remove a small wooden vase from her clothes, poured out a few drops of holy oil, gently rubbing it against Fu Hongxue’s face and hands. She also repeatedly murmured Buddhist prayers, then asked again, “What desires do you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue chanted, “To be as stable and unmoving as the earth, as peaceful and as deep as an earth depository.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi lightly tapped him on the crown of his head with the palm of her hand. “Alright. Go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes. I go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head. His pallid face was already gleaming with light. It wasn’t the light of oil. It was a holy light of serenity and peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe once more ascended to the stone platform, then walked to stand in front of Madame Zhuo. He suddenly said, “Now, I already know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Know what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Know it was you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo’s face suddenly changed. “What else do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I know everything which I should know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhu said, “You…how could you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Quietly pondering deep secrets, like an earthen repository.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked onto the stone platform. Facing Gongzi Yu, not only did he seem as calm as a huge boulder, he really did seem as unshakable as the earth itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeins had already appeared on the hand with which Gongzi Yu gripped his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue looked at him. He suddenly said, “You have already been defeated once. Why must you insist on being defeated again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu’s pupils contracted. Suddenly, with a loud shout, his sword left the sheath. Scarlet sword light flashed like a rainbow lightning bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly people with extremely strong eyesight could see that there seemed to be a faint flash of sabre light within in the rainbow lightning bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a ‘ding’, all movement seemed to coalesce. All things and all creatures on the earth came to a halt in that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s sabre had already entered his sheath again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu’s sword was only an inch away from his throat, but he didn’t pierce him through. His entire body seemed to have suddenly stiffened. And then, the bronze mask on his face slowly split apart, revealing his own face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA handsome, spirited, and attractive face, but one filled with shock and terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat ‘ding’ was heard again as the mask fell to the floor. The sword fell to the floor as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis person was actually Yan Nanfei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire light was still flickering without pause, but the great audience hall was as deathly silent as a tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei finally spoke. “When did you find out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Not long ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “When you drew your sabre, you already knew it was me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “So you were already certain of victory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because my heart was already orderly and unmovable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei let out a long sigh. Dispiritedly, he said, “Of course you should have been certain, because I should have died to you already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted up the long sword, then offered it forwards with both hands. “Please. Please finish it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him. “Now, is your deepest desire ended?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue dully said, “Then you are already a dead man. Why should I bother to kill you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around, not sparing Yan Nanfei another glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly to hear a sigh coming from behind him. A drop of blood splashed towards him, falling near his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still didn’t turn around, but an indescribable, unescapable sorrow appeared on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew this result. Some results, nobody could ever change. Some people’s destinies were the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about his own destiny?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first to welcome him was Master Ruyi. Smiling, she said, “Benefactor, you won.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Master, do you truly act freely and as you wish?” [Ruyi means ‘as one wishes’.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Since you, master, aren’t truly free and act as you wish, how can you know that I have truly won?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Ruyi let out a light sigh. “Well said. Victory or defeat, acting as one wishes or being restrained, who can truly tell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her hands together, quietly murmured a Buddhist prayer, then slowly walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Fu Hongxue lifted his head up, the only person left in the great hall was Madame Zhuo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking at him. When he turned his head over, she slowly said, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Victory is victory. The victor gains everything, the defeated perishes. This can’t be faked in the slightest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a sigh. “Now, Yan Nanfei is already dead. You, naturally, are already…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue interrupted her words. “Yan Nanfei is already dead. How about Gongzi Yu?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Yan Nanfei is Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “He truly is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Can it be that he is not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “He definitely is not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo laughed. She suddenly stretched her hand out and pointed behind her. “Take another look. What is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smooth, flat stone platform behind her suddenly split open. An enormous bronze mirror was slowly rising from beneath the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “A bronze mirror.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “What else is in the mirror?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a person in the mirror. Fu Hongxue was standing in front of the mirror. His reflection was in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “What do you now see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I see myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Then you have seen Gongzi Yu, because now, you are Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was silent. She said he was Gongzi Yu, but he was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough sometimes silence is a form of soundless protest, most of the time, it was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “You are extremely intelligent. From the hand which Master Ruyi used to anoint you with oil, you could guess that the woman from last night was not her, and was me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was still silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Thus, by now, you definitely understand why you are Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly said, “Now, I really am Gongzi Yu?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “At least, you are for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “When will I no longer be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “When an even stronger person in the martial world appears. At that time…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “At that time, I will be like today’s Yan Nanfei.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Right. At that time, not only will you not be Gongzi Yu, you will also no longer be Fu Hongxue. At that time, you will be a dead man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. Her laughter was tender and sweet. “But I believe that within the next ten years, there definitely will not be anybody in the martial world stronger than you. Thus, for now, everything is yours. You can enjoy all your wealth and fame, and you can enjoy me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue tightly gripped his sabre. “You will always be Gongzi Yu’s woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at her. His hand tightened even further, drawing out his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly drew his sabre. A flash of sabre light. The bronze mirror split in half, just like how the bronze mask on Yan Nanfei’s face split in half. When the bronze mirror fell apart, it revealed a man within it. An old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small, exquisite room behind the mirror, with a small but magnificent couch in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis old man was reclining on the couch. He was already a very, very old man, but his eyes must have long ago received all the blessings and benedictions of all the spirits of heaven and ghosts of hell, because they had retained their youth. These two eyes were the eyes which Fu Hongxue had seen in the iron cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two eyes were staring at him right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s sabre entered the sheath. Staring at him with blade-sharp eyes, he said, “Only one person knows who the real Gongzi Yu is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man said, “Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man said, “Why would I know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because you are the real Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man laughed. Laughter wasn’t necessarily a denial. At least, his type of laughter definitely was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “The fame and wealth which Gongzi Yu has, definitely was not easily acquired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no such thing as reaping without sowing in the world. Especially when it comes to fame, wealth, and power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “A man will find it very difficult to part with things which he already owns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll people were like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Unfortunately, you are already old, and your physical strength is failing you. If you want to preserve everything you have, you must find someone to take your place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Naturally, you must find the strongest person, and so you found Yan Nanfei!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu smiled. “He definitely was very strong, and also very young.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Thus, he couldn’t resist your lures and became your substitute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Originally, he was a very good one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Unfortunately, at the Phoenix Market, he was defeated by my sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “To him, that truly was a great pity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “And to you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “The same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “The same?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Since there was already a stronger person to replace him, why should I use him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “But I promised him that if he could defeat you within this year, he could still have everything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe once more reiterated, “I wanted him to defeat you, not to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because you want the strongest person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “He believed that the most fearful part of my sabreplay is my drawing of the sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “So he bitterly trained in drawing his sword. Unfortunately, after a year, he still wasn’t certain of beating you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “So that made him want the Sorrowful Book and the Peacock Plume all the more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “So he was wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “This was his mistake as well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Because he didn’t know that these two things had long ago fallen into my hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shut his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “He also didn’t know that these two things simply weren’t as terrifying as the legends made them out to be. Even if he had obtained them, he still wouldn’t be assured of victory against you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegends made everything in them better than they actually were. Fu Hongxue understood this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “I could tell long ago that you were stronger than him, because you have a strangely tough and resilient sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained, “You can resist pain which others cannot endure, and can withstand attacks which others cannot handle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “So you hoped that I would win this battle from the start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “So I had Zhuo Zi keep you company. I didn’t want you to be too tense before the final battle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shut his mouth again. Now, he finally understood everything. All of the unexplicable mysteries suddenly became very simple in the blink of an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at him, Gongzi Yu said, “And so, you are now Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I am only Gongzi Yu’s body double.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “But you already have everything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No one can truly have this ‘everything’. This ‘everything’ will forever be yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Therefore…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Therefore, right now I am still Fu Hongxue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu’s pupils suddenly contracted. “You aren’t willing to accept everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pupils contracted, and his hand tightened again. The hand with which he drew his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long time, Gongzi Yu suddenly laughed. “You can already tell that I am an old man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue admitted to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You are thirty-five or thirty-six years old this year, yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Thirty seven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Do you know how old I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Sixty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very strange laugh, one filled with an indescribable cynicism and sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You aren’t sixty yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “This year, I am thirty seven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him in shock, looking at the wrinkles on his face and his snow-white hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t believe it. But he knew that a decrepit-looking person wasn’t necessarily decrepit because of the passage of years. Many things could make someone old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonging could make one old. Sadness and pain could as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Do you know what aged me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue knew. If a person lusted after too much, he would age very soon. Desire is the greatest pain which man can know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew, but he did not say it. Since he already knew, why say it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu did not explain either. He knew that Fu Hongxue definitely understood his meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was precisely because I desired too much that I aged. It is precisely because I am old, that I am stronger than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke very tactfully. “If you will not be Gongzi Yu, then you will no longer be Fu Hongxue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I will be a dead man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue sat down, on top of a low table in front of the short couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was very tired. After going through that earlier battle, anybody would feel tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his heart was very energetic. He knew that there must be another battle, and that this battle must be more dangerous than the earlier one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You can consider it a bit longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I don’t need to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu was sighing. “You certainly know that I am very unwilling for you to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue knew. To find another body double such as he, definitely would not be very easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Unfortunately, I already no longer have any room to do otherwise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Neither do I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You have nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue couldn’t deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You don’t have wealth, you don’t have power, you don’t have friends, and you don’t have loved ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I only have my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You have one more thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Your reputation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again. “If you refuse me, not only will I take your life, I will destroy your reputation. I have many ways!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You seem to have everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu did not deny it either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You have wealth, you have power, and the experts under your banner are innumerable like the clouds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “To kill you, I might not need them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You have everything, save for one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You no longer have joy in life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu was laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Even if Gongzi Yu’s fame shall last into perpetuity, you yourself are already a dead man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu’s hands tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Without joy in life, one does not have a fighting spirit. So if you were to fight with me, you would be defeated without question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu was still laughing, but his laughter had become very stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “If you dare to stand up and fight me, and if you can defeat me, I will give my life to you without any complaints.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked, then continued, “But you don’t dare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fixed his gaze upon Gongzi Yu. There was a sabre in his hands. There was a sabre in his eyes. And there was a sabre in his words as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu truly did not stand up. Was it because he truly could not stand? Or was it because of Madame Zhuo’s hand? Her hand had already pressed down on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had already turned around. He slowly walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu watched him walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis walking posture was still as clumsy, as stupid as ever, but when others watched him, their eyes would still be filled with reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter who watched him, it would be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand tightly clenched the sabre the entire time, but he did not draw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not going to kill you, because you are already a dead man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a person’s heart died, even if his body was still fine, it would be of no use.

In her heart, there was only one, real, Gongzi Yu. No one could ever replace him. Regardless of if he became old, or if he died, no one could ever replace him. So she was willing to do anything for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he understand this? When would he understand this? Why was it that the silkworms of spring were only able to release their silk after dying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun set in the west. Fu Hongxue stood before the setting sun, in front of the ruins of the Peacock Manor. The twilight was cold and mesmerizing, revealing wounds and trauma everywhere around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out a white letter and placed it in front of the graves of his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snow-white letter. Deathly black words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Gongzi Yu’s obituary notice. It was an obituary notice which had spread around the entire world, and without question, stunned the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust to dust, earth to earth. People will always die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a long sigh, then raised his head to look at the sky. Dusk had began to darken, and night was about to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly felt an inexpressible peacefulness in his heart, because he knew that just before the darkness arrived, the bright moon would rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine was within his cup. The cup was within his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu placed the cup facing the window. Outside the window, there were green hills, emerald gorges, and water flowing underneath a small bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of hands pressed down on his shoulder. So beautiful. So gentle and soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lightly asked, “When did you make up your mind to do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I really understood everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is the purpose of life?” His hand lightly pressed on top of hers. “The purpose of a person’s life is to be happy and content. If he doesn’t even have joy in life, even if his fame, wealth, and power shall forever endure, what’s the use?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. Such sweet, warm, gentle laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that he really had understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough others believed him to be dead, he was still alive. Truly alive. Because he had learned how to enjoy life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a person truly understood how to enjoy life, even if he could be alive for but a day, it would be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that Gongsun Tu and the others shall not be alive long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I have already sown poisonous seeds in their heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poisonous seeds?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My wealth and my power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believe that they will die due to fighting for these things?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again. Her laughter was even gentler, softer, and sweeter than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew why he was doing this. It was because he was atoning for his crimes for her. He whole-heartedly hoped for their joy and peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, everything had succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised the cup to the wine sky, but no longer asked where the bright moon was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already knew where his bright moon was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lonely little room. A lonely woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer life was lonely and arduous, but she didn’t blame heaven, because her heart was at peace. She already was able to use her strength to make a living for herself, and no longer needed to sell herself. Perhaps she wasn’t happy, but she had learned how to endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many things in life which are not as one wishes. Everyone should learn how to endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother day had passed, a very dull day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrying a basket of clothes, she walked to the head of a small stream. She definitely had to wash these clothes before she could rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore two small jasmine flowers on her own clothes. They were her one and only luxury items. The creek’s water was clear and clean. She lowered her head down and gazed into it. Suddenly, she saw that someone had appeared in the clear, clean water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lonely man. A lonely sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart began to jump. She lifted up her head and saw a pallid face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart immediately seemed to stop moving. She had long since no longer hoped for any more happiness in her life, but now, happiness had suddenly appeared in front of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey silently stared at each other for a long, long time without opening their mouths. Happiness came to life between their mingled gazes, like a flower coming to bloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment in time, what words could possibly suffice to express their happiness and contentment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this time, the bright moon rose up in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is the bright moon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo long as your heart is alive, the bright moon is within your heart!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e \n\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNext Chapter\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-23\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-24","bookId":1505,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM"}
