The endless yellow sand buried the bones of strange and unusual beasts, looking bleak and desolate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis place seemed like a death trap, but as Lin Ming saw this scene he actually let out a sigh of relief. They had finally escaped the Paradise Reborn lands that they had fled into.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming only had a basic understanding of the dao field traces left behind by the Asura Road Master in the jade pendant. But, by using this little bit of knowledge he was able to emerge from Paradise Reborn. Moreover, by verifying the terrain with the jade pendant map, he obtained an even more profound understanding of the emperor jade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I must say… Lin Ming.” Xiao Moxian smirked as she spoke, a playful tone in her voice. She had called Lin Ming by his true name and not Lin Lanjian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What?” Lin Ming asked Xiao Moxian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ah… how come you don’t have any reaction at all? Although your identity is already obvious, if I suddenly call you by your name shouldn’t you at least be shocked or surprised?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter suppressing it for such a long time, Xiao Moxian was finally able to tear down Lin Ming’s secret identity. She was originally anticipating seeing the surprise on his face; that would at least give her a little bit of a sense of accomplishment. However, Lin Ming’s reaction was far too calm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was like someone doing their best to correctly guess a riddle, but the riddler themself wasn’t affected at all. This made Xiao Moxian feel a bit unhappy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Didn’t you know a long time ago? Moreover… I already knew that you knew.” Lin Ming faintly smiled as he indifferently spoke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Well, that was boring.” Xia Moxian spread her arms wide in defeat. “What do you plan on doing next? Not only are you being chased down by a World King but you also have to face the perilous God Burying Ridge, a land of almost certain death. And, what is worse is that the World King and his group have guides to lead the way while we are like headless flies in this chaos. No matter how you look at it, we’re going to die without a doubt.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If you knew you were going to die then why would you follow me?” Lin Ming said, smiling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I said that I owe you a life, and since I saw you about to die soon I thought I should lend you a hand, but… you seemed pretty confident so you must have a plan of some kind. Why don’t you tell me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shook his head. “I have yet to think of a good plan. Frankly speaking, God Burying Ridge isn’t too threatening to me. The greatest threat is from that World King powerhouse chasing me down. Now, what I have to do first is to feel out the specifics of God Burying Ridge’s dao field and verify it with what I know in my heart. If I can familiarize myself with the environment here then I can control the landscape and the advantage. Only then will I have the ability to contend with a World King.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming casually said. But as Xiao Moxian heard this she was secretly surprised.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout a guide to lead him through God Burying Ridge, Lin Ming actually said that God Burying Ridge didn’t pose too great a threat to him. Did he have something he could rely on?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat shocked Xiao Moxian the most was that Lin Ming said he wanted to familiarize himself with God Burying Ridge’s environment and use this advantage to contend with a World King. This was simply incomprehensible to her. If it weren’t for Lin Ming acknowledging his true identity just now, Xiao Moxian might have suspected he was someone else who had inherited the legacy of some God Burying Ridge guide.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhile Xiao Moxian was basking in her amazement, Lin Ming was searching the jade pendant with his sense, looking for a place where he could hide himself and prepare for a guerilla battle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut at this time, Lin Ming suddenly felt a light sense wash over him, lasting for only the most fleeting moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis caused Lin Ming to be startled. Although this sense was incomparably vague, his intuition wasn’t wrong. Someone was using some arcane searching technique to find his location in God Burying Ridge!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn Heavendevil City there were innumerable martial artists. As long as he used an appearance changing technique there was no search technique that would have any effect on finding him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now he was in God Burying Ridge, a land where there wasn’t anyone within 10,000 miles. As long as someone found him with their searching technique, regardless of whether or not he had changed his appearance, they would still find him. This other party clearly knew what happened to him after he entered God Burying Ridge and was looking for him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We’ve been discovered!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming sucked in a deep breath. Without Lin Ming mentioning it, Xiao Moxian had also noticed that faint detection sense sweep over them just now. “If someone dares to recklessly use a searching technique like this in God Burying Ridge they must really not fear any evil beings they might draw in. It seems your guess was right; we really are being chased down by a World King powerhouse.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian couldn’t smile at this time. They were stuck in a danger zone and also being hunted down by a World King!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Follow me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming turned towards a direction and used his movement technique, instantly launching forwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e…………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time several hundred miles away, Imperial Prince Naqi and his group of people were surrounded by a mob of ghosts, engaged in a fierce battle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the Spider Brothers to guide them and also force fields to hide them, Naqi and his group could have easily ventured deep into God Burying Ridge and obtained all sorts of treasures.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, as soon as they entered the inner ridge, Mister Zhou and the others had used all sorts of searching techniques like the Heaven Spying Art, making them shine like a lighthouse at night, This caused all of the surrounding evil beings to come hurtling towards them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“How troublesome!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi frowned as his halberd smashed through a corpse devil. With two World King level powerhouses present, there was no threat from these evil beings. Even so, this undoubtedly hindered their speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time from beside Naqi, Tian Mingzi suddenly said, “We should divide our group into two.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi looked towards Tian Mingzi.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It is far too inefficient to search for them as we are now. If we split up it will be much quicker.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn their group they had two World Kings and their searching techniques overlapped to a great extent. If they could divide their group in half it would indeed be much faster.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi and Mister Zhou looked at each other, and then Mister Zhou said, “Alright.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith Tian Mingzi’s Great World King cultivation he simply didn’t need a guide to walk through God Burying Ridge.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Great World King was only inferior to an Empyrean. Unless he ventured into the few absolute death zones in God Burying Ridge, there was nothing here that was a threat to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, the premise for all this was that they didn’t enter Tragic Death Valley. Tragic Death Valley was a place where even Empyreans would die!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi nodded. He launched his movement technique and readied himself to fly away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“But… I hope that I can leave a tracking rune on your body. This is also for your own safety. How about it?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust as Tian Mingzi was about to leave, Mister Zhou stopped him with some words. A tracking rune appeared on his fingertip. This was one of the Asura Road’s god runes and symbolized the Laws of the Asura Road. Once this rune marked his body then it was impossible for even someone of Tian Mingzi’s cultivation level to remove.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi frowned. He didn’t like to be followed, but after a moment’s hesitation he nodded his head in assent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMister Zhou flicked his fingers and the rune shot into Tian Mingzi’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, Tian Mingzi didn’t delay any further. He turned and flew away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLooking at Tian Mingzi’s vanishing back, Imperial Prince Naqi said, “If that fellow suddenly proposed to divide into two groups, he must have some other reason to do so.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi was someone who believed everyone was plotting something, and Tian Mingzi was someone who was particularly good at scheming. If he suddenly wanted to split up the group, he was definitely trying something.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He might have discovered something. Perhaps he wishes to explore a lucky chance by himself, or perhaps he found Lin Ming and is in a hurry to kill him so he can plunder the secrets from his body for himself!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Mister Zhou spoke these words, Naqi wrinkled his eyebrows. “Yet you still let him leave. Even a tracking mark is useless; it will only take an instant to kill Lin Ming with the difference in their cultivation. At that time, all the secrets on Lin Ming’s body will be taken by him.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMister Zhou said, “Imperial Prince Your Highness, you can’t have your cake and eat it too. Lin Ming has a great destiny on his body, and even if all of us join together and attack him now, killing him won’t be easy. Even Tian Mingzi only guarantees our chances to be higher. If Tian Mingzi can really kill Lin Ming then even if he takes all of Lin Ming’s secrets for himself we will also have gained.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I suppose.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi would certainly be happy if he didn’t need to pay any price to kill Lin Ming. Of course, this was based on the fact that he simply didn’t know what secret Lin Ming had on him. If he knew about the existence of the Magic Cube, then perhaps even the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign would personally tear apart God Burying Ridge; he might even engage in all-out war with the soul race for that reason alone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMister Zhou’s guess was correct. Whether it was in strength or sensing ability, Tian Mingzi surpassed Mister Zhou. Even Mister Zhou’s Heaven Spying Art was unable to compare with Tian Mingzi.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA moment ago Tian Mingzi had already found Lin Ming’s location. A man and a woman travelling alone; that was undoubtedly Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe reason he proposed to divide the group into two was because he wanted to have sole possession of Lin Ming’s secrets.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming… the end of your days has come. Everything that you have will be mine!” Tian Mingzi’s eyes shimmered with an ominous light. He had waited for this day for far too long!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe desperately wished to kill Lin Ming! As Tian Mingzi’s sense passed over Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian, it was even clearer than it was a moment ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s mind chilled and he stopped where he was. “There is no need to continue running. The enemy has arrived, and he is much faster than we are…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1479\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1481\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1480","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM"}
