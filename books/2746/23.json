That\u0027s messed up.\" Then Macey let out a low, soft laugh, pushed off from the wall and studied me. \"I hope he\u0027s worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped just before she passed me. \"Really? He is? \u0027Cause I don\u0027t see what\u0027s so special about him that you\u0027d risk losing what you\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good question. A great question, especially if you\u0027re Macey McHenry and everything in life has been given to you but nothing has been earned. If the world looks at your slick, plastic shell and expects there to be nothing but candy inside. If this is your one and only shot at being part of a family—despite your famous last name. Yeah. Then that\u0027s a really good question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just…\" I tried, wanting to say \"sweet\" or \"caring\" or \"funny\"—because they\u0027re all totally true. But instead, I said, \"He\u0027s just a normal boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmph,\" Macey scoffed. \"I know lots of normal boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her. \"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh was supposed to meet me at the gazebo, but he wasn\u0027t in sight. In fact, no one was in sight. I glanced toward the movie theater—nothing. The lights were off in all the stores, and as a scrap of orange paper blew across the deserted town square, I was reminded of a scene from just about every apocalypse movie ever made (and at least three episodes of Buffy).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a little freaked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Operative surveyed the area, assessing possible threats and exit routes and whether or not that really cute purse in the Anderson\u0027s Accessories store window ever would go on sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a minivan turned onto the street. I guess I was too busy staring at its MY CHILD IS AN HONOR STUDENT AT ROSEVILLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL bumper sticker to notice who was driving, because I didn\u0027t realize it was Josh until he parked and got out and stood there in the middle of the empty street, holding a wrist corsage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right. You read that correctly—flowers on a stick (or, well, flowers on a stretchy band thingy).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked toward me slowly, as I said, \"That\u0027s a wrist corsage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said, blushing. \"Well, it\u0027s a special occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, is this an inside joke thing or a your-mom-made\u0027 you-buy-it thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned down to kiss me but stopped halfway. \"You wanna know the truth?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a quick peck on my check, then he said, \"Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt approximately 18:07 hours The Subject presented The Operative with a vital piece of (floral) evidence. Macey McHenry later determined this to be an eight on the overall \"lameness scale.\" The Operative, however, thought it was sweet and kind of funny, and decided to wear it with pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look great,\" he said, but I totally didn\u0027t. I mean, I looked movie okay or bowling okay. I soooo didn\u0027t look wrist-corsage okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged at my skirt. \"So what is this special occasion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he laughed. \"You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d remember, did you?\" he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember what? the girl in me wanted to scream, but the spy in me just smiled and said, \"Of course I knew you\u0027d remember.\" Total lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\"—Josh went to open the door—\"shall we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to protocol, an operative should never allow herself to be transported to a secondary location. However, because of her history with The Subject and the fact that she once tossed him to the street like a sack of potatoes, The Operative thought it was probably safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never been in a minivan before. It was like the roadtrip portion of my great small-town experiment—with cup holders. Take it from someone who is highly interested in gadgetry on both a personal and professional level—the modern-day espionage world has nothing on the good folks at General Motors when it comes to cup holder design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saving for a car, you know?\" he said, like he\u0027d thought I was being sarcastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really,\" I hurried to say. \"It\u0027s… roomy, and it\u0027s got these great… I just like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe wrist corsages cut off circulation to the brain? I mean, is that why so many girls do stupid things on prom night? I was really going to have to investigate this further, I decided. Then I caught a glimpse of Josh in the dashboard lights, and he was, in a word, beautiful. His hair was longer now, and I could see the shadow of his long eyelashes on his cheekbones. The more I was around him the more I saw the little things—like his hands or the small scar at the edge of his jaw where (he says) he got cut in a knife fight, but where (according to his medical files) he fell off his bike when he was seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have scars, too, of course. But Josh can never hear the stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh?\" I said, and he glanced at me. We were almost out of town, and the trees were growing heavier overhead as the road curved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he asked softly, as if secretly fearing something was wrong. He turned off of the highway and onto a winding bit of blacktop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so there are two basic things I know for a fact about the good citizens of Roseville. One: they honestly have no clue about what really goes on at the Gallagher Academy. None. You\u0027d think there would be a few government conspiracy theories floating around about what takes place behind our ivy-covered walls, but I never heard a single one (and I had reason to listen).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second thing about Roseville is that it takes its small-town-ness seriously. As if the gazebo and town carnival hadn\u0027t been enough to tip me off, I saw a man with a reflector vest and a flashlight directing traffic as soon as Josh pulled into a pasture. Yeah, that\u0027s right, crowd control in pastures is key to small-town life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe parked at the end of a line of cars, and I looked at Josh. \"What\u0027s going—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see.\" Then he walked around to open my door. (I know—totally sweet!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe followed the gentle strains of music that floated out toward us, riding on a wave of light that filtered between the slats and through the sliding doors of a huge old barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I cried, \"that looks just like our barn—\" He looked at me quizzically. \"—in Mongolia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the fall harvest dance,\" Josh explained. \"It\u0027s a Roseville tradition from back when almost everyone farmed. But now it\u0027s just an excuse for everyone to get drunk and dance with people they\u0027re not married to.\" He stopped and looked at me. \"We can do whatever you want to do, but when I heard this was tonight I kinda thought you might want to come,\" he said. \"I mean…it\u0027s okay if you want to go do something else. We could…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut him up with a kiss (a basic technique that, I\u0027ve been told, even non-spy girls have used with great success). \"Let\u0027s dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I just say that doing the tango with Madame Dabney had totally not prepared me for what actual dances are like? Sure, if I ever have to infiltrate an embassy party, I\u0027ll probably be glad I\u0027ve had C\u0026amp;A, but I could tell as soon as we walked into the barn that I didn\u0027t have the training for this. Streamers hung from the rafters above us. Twinkling lights formed a tentlike dome. A flatbed trailer sat along the south wall, and a band was playing an old country song while what looked like the entire population of Roseville danced around in circles. I saw a hayloft above us at the far end of the barn, but where we stood there was nothing above us but rafters and lights. Old women sat on bales of straw, clapping, keeping rhythm as the deputy chief of police (I recognized him from the dunk tank) picked up a fiddle and started to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle girls danced by, standing on their fathers\u0027 feet, and Josh led me to a folding table that was draped with crepe paper. \"Well, hi there, honey,\" said the woman sitting behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Shirley,\" Josh replied as he reached for his wallet. \"Two, please,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honey,\" she said, \"your momma already took care of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh looked at me, panic in his eyes, as every ounce of blood in my body turned cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re here already?\" Josh asked, but before Shirley could answer, I heard someone cry, \"Josh! Cammie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deputy chief of police put down his fiddle, and everyone clapped as the kid who works the ticket booth at the movie theater picked up a saxophone. Everyone on the floor picked up their tempo—especially the thin, immaculate woman who was rushing toward us with her arms outstretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh! Cammie!\" Her ivory sweater set and light-colored trousers were just begging for a stain in the dusty barn, but she didn\u0027t act like she cared as she pushed her way through the tide of dancing couples—a tall, thin man trailing dutifully behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Josh whispered as he pulled me away from Shirley and toward the stampeding couple. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027m so sorry. We only have to say hi to them. I thought I\u0027d have time to warn—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie, darling!\" the woman cried. \"Well, if you aren\u0027t just the cutest thing?\" And then she hugged me. Oh, yeah, a complete stranger actually hugged me—something the Gallagher Academy had totally not prepared me for. She gripped me by the shoulders and stared into my eyes. \"I\u0027m Mrs. Abrams. It is so nice to finally meet you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she hugged me again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce deep inside enemy territory, The Operative met with high-ranking officials in the organization. She was NOT prepared for this development, but any diversionary tactics would SERIOUSLY compromise the entire operation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Mrs. Abrams said, \"I see you\u0027re wearing your corsage.\" And then she fingered the flowers. \"Isn\u0027t that lovely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Josh in his neatly pressed khakis and his button-down shirt, and I suddenly understood why he always dressed less like a high school boy and more like a … pharmacist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, young lady,\" the man said, once his wife released me. \"I\u0027m Joshua\u0027s father, Mr. Abrams. And how are you finding our fair town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t good, I thought, realizing I was surrounded. I didn\u0027t belong here, and it wasn\u0027t going to take Josh\u0027s parents long to realize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about my options: A) fake a medical condition and rush outside, B) pick up the pen with which Shirley was writing receipts and do some damage before getting gang tackled by some well-meaning townspeople, or C) think of this as my most deep-cover assignment yet and milk it for all it was worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a very nice town,\" I said, extending my hand to the man. \"Mr. Abrams, so nice to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was tall and had wavy hair like Josh\u0027s. He wore wire-rimmed glasses and relished in waving at the people who passed by. \"Hi, Carl, Betty,\" he said to one couple. \"Got those new bunion-removing pads you like, Pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our family\u0027s run this town\u0027s pharmacy since 1938,\" Mrs. Abrams told me proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mr. Abrams asked, \"Has Josh told you about our little business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"He has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not a person in this room I haven\u0027t medicated,\" Mr. Abrams said, and beside me, I felt Josh choke on the punch his mother had handed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s …\" I struggled for words. \"…impressive.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-23.html","bookId":2746,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM"}
