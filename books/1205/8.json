Therefore persuade her to fly; I will furnish you with the means of flight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"At the head of your bed, behind a curtain upon which are embroidered the arms of the lords of Cambes, to whom ?le Saint-Georges formerly belonged,—Monsieur le Vicomte de Cambes, my late husband, presented it to the king,—you will find a door to which this is the key. It is one of the entrances to an extensive underground passage which passes beneath the bed of the river, and comes out at the manor of Cambes. Persuade Mademoiselle Nanon de Lartigues to fly through that passage—and, if you love her, fly with her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I answer for her safety upon my honor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Adieu. We are quits.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"VICOMTESSE DE CAMBES.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles read and re-read the letter, shivering with fear at every word, growing paler with every reading; he felt that a mysterious power, which he could not fathom, enveloped him, and directed his actions. Might not this same underground passage, from his bedroom to the Chateau de Cambes, which was to serve to assure Nanon\u0027s safety, serve equally well, if the secret were generally known, to deliver Saint-Georges to the enemy?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Vibrac followed, upon the governor\u0027s expressive features, the emotions which were reflected there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bad news, commandant?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it seems that we are to be attacked again to-night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The fanatics!\" said Vibrac. \"I should have supposed we had given them a sufficient dressing-down, and were not likely to hear of them again for a week at least.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no need to enjoin the strictest watchfulness upon you,\" said Canolles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have no fear, commandant. Probably they will try to surprise us, as they did before?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no idea; but let us be ready for anything, and take the same precautions that we took before. Finish my round of inspection for me; I must go to my room; I have some orders to give.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Vibrac touched his hat and strode away with the soldierly indifference to danger often exhibited by those whose profession brings them face to face with it at every step.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles went to his room, taking every possible precaution not to be seen by Nanon; and having made sure that he was alone, locked himself in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the head of his bed were the arms of the lords of Cambes, upon a tapestry hanging surrounded by a band of gold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles raised the band, which was not attached to the tapestry, and disclosed the crack of a door. With the aid of the key which accompanied the viscountess\u0027s letter, he opened the door, and found himself confronted by the gaping orifice of a subterranean passage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment Canolles was struck dumb, and stood motionless, with the sweat pouring from his brow. This mysterious opening into the bowels of the earth terrified him in spite of himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He lighted a candle and prepared to inspect it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First, he descended twenty steep stairs, then kept on down a gentler slope farther and farther into the depths.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon he heard a dull, rumbling noise, which alarmed him at first, because he could not think to what cause to attribute it; but as he went forward he recognized it as the roar of the river flowing above his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The water had forced its way through the arch in divers places at one time or another, but the crevices had evidently been detected in time and filled with a sort of cement, which became harder in course of time than the stones it bound together.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For about ten minutes Canolles heard the water rolling over his head; then the noise gradually died away until it was hardly more than a murmur. At last even the murmuring ceased, to be succeeded by perfect silence; and after walking a hundred feet or more in the silence, Canolles reached a staircase similar to the one by which he had descended, and closed at the top by a massive door which the united strength of ten men could not have moved, and which was rendered fire-proof by a thick iron plate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now I understand,\" said Canolles; \"she will await Nanon at this door and help her to escape.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He retraced his steps beneath the river-bed, ascended the staircase, re-entered his room, replaced the gold band, and betook himself deep in thought to Nanon\u0027s apartments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48669.html","bookId":1205,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:56:02 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:56:02 AM"}
