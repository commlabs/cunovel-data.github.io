You got this or do you need an intervention?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"No, I got this. She\u0027s there, dude. Jane doesn’t want her to get better. She wants her broken and sick so I\u0027ll be broken and sick too. Sarah is almost back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m giving you the day and then I\u0027m coming in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand I love you but I don’t trust this shit. I know how you get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chuckle slips from my lip, \"I know. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be cool,\" he hangs up and I look at the sleeping girl. She looks so peaceful until a whimper slips from her lips. She cries and scrambles a little bit. I see her moving and feeling around. She\u0027s panicking, and I almost take back everything I\u0027ve thought about her being better, but she does the thing she needs to. She self soothes and comforts herself. She keeps away the lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not in the hole. I\u0027m not in the hole,\" she whispers and shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light comes on again from the cell phone. She messages me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I want to go home. I don’t want your money and help. I just want to be free.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where will you go?\u0027 I frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Women\u0027s shelter? Convent? Anywhere I can to get away from you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh to myself, she\u0027s getting saucier. \u0027That\u0027s hurtful considering I am the only person in the world you have.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I would laugh. If I weren’t sitting in the dark smelling my own piss and feeling disturbed and disgusted at the thought of what you\u0027ll do to me next.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to play this game anymore. She\u0027s ready and I don’t need to scare her anymore. She needs the truth. The thing Jane doesn’t want me to do. I dial and speak in the voice that is mine, the real me. The one she doesn’t remember but knows better than any of the other faces I have shown her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answers, looking dark and fuzzy on FaceTime. I smile, \"Hi. Where will you go without me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I need to go. Please. I can\u0027t do this anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Go to the door and wait. I will come and get you. It\u0027s almost New Year\u0027s Eve.\" I shouldn\u0027t tell her what day it is. We need her to think she has been here for so much longer than she has. We need her to be lost in every way. But I gave her the cell phone, she must have looked at the date already. I turn off the phone and place it on the table, leaving it there. We will need to be alone, completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the door, pressing my hand on the handle and taking a deep breath. She needs the truth, no matter how badly it will hurt, she will need it. I place my hand into the open space of the door and wait for her to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything should trigger her, it\u0027s that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe places her weak little hand in mine and I pull her to the bathroom, \"Clean up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates and then steps into the bathroom alone, maybe not completely seeing the freedom she is being given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean against the wall and watch the light under the door move as she does. Finally she comes out, frowning, \"Were you there the entire time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowls even more at me, \"Scared I\u0027d get away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and stay just being me. I don’t need to intimidate her anymore. I shake my head, \"No. I stayed in case you were scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer apprehension of the real me is a bad feeling but I understand. I just hope she will too. She gives me a wide-eyed look, \"Is this place like a whole floor of a building? It\u0027s weird with all the hallways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost laugh but the dread of the things I\u0027m about to say are too thick in my throat. I put my hand out for her. She takes it and I resist the urge to lift it and kiss her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring her to one of the actual sleeping rooms for the people like me who help Jane out. It\u0027s a nice room, sort of girlie and soft. I think it\u0027s the best choice for her. I turn and leave the room. I press my back against the closed door and try to imagine how I am going to say what I have to. I close my eyes and imagine the conversation. I shake away the thought that she will end up catatonic. She can do this. She is ready, I am sure. Pretty sure. I go back into the room to find her lying on the bed. I crawl up next to her. I look at her for a minute and smile. I take a breath and just say it, \"There is something important we need to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I\u0027m too tired. If you\u0027re going to kill me, just do it. I don’t care anymore. I\u0027m done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re prepared to die?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I am dead. You have killed everything inside of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever feared I would kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lies, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles but I keep going, \"If you had one wish, what would it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer is fast and always the same, \"I don’t know. To be normal, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss the top of her head, whispering in my head that I am about to give her that, if only she can let me get it all out. I don’t say that to her though. I whisper, \"You wanted to know why I cared what your name was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and a tear slips down my cheek, \"My sister was named Emalyn. The Spicers were the couple that kidnapped us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe freezes completely and then whispers back, \"You are the boy in the hole? From the house? Eli? That was your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, holding back my sobs but the tears will not be contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality hits her like a ton of bricks, \"You saved me. I killed your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap around her and hold her as the dam breaks and the flood of emotions and painful reality break their way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no going back. From here, there is only truths and harsh realism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her shifting on the bed but I keep my eyes closed. I\u0027m exhausted from staying awake and waiting to see if the lonely comes to claim her. She moves, and for some reason, I feel her eyes on my face. I smile a little and sigh, \"We haven’t slept beside each other in fourteen years and it still feels the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes and kiss her sweet face. The tears are flooding her eyes. I kiss the one that gets away. I can\u0027t help but be completely me with her now. I don’t have any acts left in me. I just want to be real. I kiss her whole face except the place I really want to. It\u0027s not the right time for that kiss and I haven’t earned my way into her heart. I probably won\u0027t ever. I whisper, \"You\u0027re safe now. You remember it all. You\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is still in shock and I know all the walls are crumbling, leaving a haze in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never blamed you. I saw what was happening. I saw you make the choice to try to save her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I can\u0027t do this. Put me back in the cell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold her tightly, \"No. You need to tell me the things you remember. I know you remember them now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Grand Canyon.\" The words sound like they actually hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t give up, I keep going, \"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dirty house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes her eyes, \"My name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see why I brought you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t answer, I don’t think she can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I ask forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loses it a little, \"To punish me for helping them. For killing her. For stealing her name and pretending to be her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer instantly breaks me inside. I grab her face and make her look at me, \"No. No, you\u0027re missing the point.\" I let her go and get up. I don’t know how to take the shame of what she is feeling. I pace, \"Don’t you see? All of it was so obvious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes, both her head and body. I feel the pity for her leaving me. I grab the bed and shake it, losing my hold, \"GOD DAMMIT! I\u0027M TRYING TO SAVE YOU! I\u0027M TRYING TO FREE YOU!\" It takes me a minute to get the control over my rage back. I take a deep breath, \"All of this has been planned to free you. You were never going to get better. You were always trapped in that house. You never left it. You took her life and never lived it. She would have wanted you to live, Sarah. You\u0027ve hidden it all away and punished yourself for something that was never your fault. Don\u0027t you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t realize I\u0027ve said her real name until I see her start to freak out even more. She yanks at the covers and twitches. I point at her, \"You will tell me the story. Now you choose how you want it. By the fire, in the dark cell, in the tub, or in the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and hold a hand out for her. She gets up and takes it. I drag her to the cell and close us both in with the smell of her urine. I can\u0027t sit. I\u0027m wired and scared, and this is the part I have dreaded more than anything else in the world. I pace and shake my head. My lips quiver when I see it all again. We are about live through the whole visual and the dark of the cell, and the smell of the corner is making it more real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the dead look is in her eyes when she talks. She sounds dead inside, \"I think they had been doing it a long time. I don’t know if I was their kid or if they took me. I don’t have very many memories before you came. I remember other kids at the house though. They would stay for a short time and then be gone, and Randy would start to get edgy and angry. I was in the hole before we met you and Emalyn. She pulled back the lid and dragged me out. Said we were going for a car ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear her break as she speaks. She takes a breath and continues, \"We got to the Grand Canyon the next day, but I never got to see anything. They dragged me around the whole time. Pulling me after them. He picked her. He asked me if I wanted her too. I did. I said I did. I didn’t want to be alone anymore. I never saw you, just her. She was shiny and pretty. Then they dragged me back to the car. Laura took me home and Randy stayed at the Grand Canyon. The next day you guys were there, with me at the dirty house. She was allowed to play with me for a couple days. I shared my bed with her and my dolls but she didn’t want them. She cried. She cried all the time.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-17.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
