A Giggle Box, a Leaky Faucet, and a Foghorn 咯咯机、漏水龙头以及大喇叭","content":"Every day after lunch Mrs. Jewls read a story to the class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana hated stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The last book Mrs. Jewls had read was a story about a pig and spider. The pig was real cute and the spider was very wise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana thought it was a horrible book. It made her laugh too much. Everyone else laughed too, but the problem was that Dana always kept laughing long after everyone else in the class had stopped. It was very embarrassing. And sometimes she broke out laughing at a part that wasn\u0027t even funny because she remembered something funny that had happened earlier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John called her a giggle box.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That only made her laugh harder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once she broke up laughing in the middle of an arithmetic test because she remembered something funny the pig had said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There goes the giggle box,\" said John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She hated John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But that wasn\u0027t the worst part of the book. In the end, the spider died.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana couldn\u0027t stop crying. And she thought it was so silly, too, because in real life she didn\u0027t even like spiders! She squashed them all the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John called her a leaky faucet. \"Somebody better call a plumber to fix the leaky faucet,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She laughed through her tears. She hated John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once in music, they had learned a song about a dragon. When the song begins the dragon is very brave, but then he loses his only friend, so he isn\u0027t brave anymore. He just goes back to his cave, where he is sad and lonely for the rest of his life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The song always made Dana cry. Every recess John\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 73\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and Joe would chase after her, singing it. She\u0027d run across the playground with her hands over her ears and tears streaming down her face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bell rang. Lunch was over. Dana nervously walked up the stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. Mrs. Jewls would start a new book today. She hoped it wouldn\u0027t be funny or sad. She hoped Mrs. Jewls would read a boring story with no jokes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she got to class, John and Joe were standing by her desk waiting for her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Happy birthday, Dana,\" said John. He was holding a present. It was wrapped in green paper and had a pink bow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it\u0027s not my birthday,\" said Dana.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s okay,\" said John. \"You can have it anyway. Since I\u0027m always teasing you.\" He and Joe snickered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana eagerly tore off the wrapping paper. Maybe John wasn\u0027t so bad after all, she thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a box of tissues.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John and Joe laughed hysterically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not funny!\" said Dana. She raised her fist and started to chase after them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell, and all the children settled quietly in their seats.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are ready to begin a new story,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She held up the book. \"It\u0027s called \u0027Stinky.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 74\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana laughed at the title, then quickly covered her mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s about a cute and playful skunk,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no!\" gasped Dana. She knew animal stories always made her cry. The animal\u0027s mother would get shot by human hunters. Or else humans would build a shopping center and destroy the animal\u0027s home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She hated humans. But she knew that was silly, because she was a human, and so were all her friends. The only human she really hated was John, and she didn\u0027t think he was even human!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls read:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was such a beautiful day, Stinky and his mother went for a walk across the forest. \u0027Hi, Stinky,\u0027 said Charlie the chipmunk. \u0027Hi, Charlie,\u0027 said Stinky. \u0027Come along, Stinky,\u0027 called his mother. Stinky hurried after her. They came to a road. Suddenly Stinky heard a noise he had never heard before. It was very loud, like thunder. A car, driven by humans, was speeding toward him! \u0027Look out!\u0027 shouted his mother. Stinky stopped in the middle of the road and stared at the onrushing car. He had never seen a car before. His mother pushed him out of the way just in time. He was safe, but unfortunately, the car ran over his mother. \u0027Mama, Mama,\u0027 he sobbed over and\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 75\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e over again, but his mother didn\u0027t answer. She was dead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Uh-oh, there goes the leaky faucet,\" said John. He and Joe laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana sniffled and wiped her eyes, but the tears wouldn\u0027t stop. She just kept thinking about poor Stinky. What would he do without his mother? she wondered. Maybe he could go live with Charlie the chipmunk, she hoped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She pulled a tissue out of the box John had given her and loudly blew her nose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There goes the foghorn,\" said John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana laughed into her tissue. She blew her nose again, even louder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It must be a very foggy day,\" said John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day after lunch Dana hurried up the thirty flights of stairs before the bell rang, so she could talk to Mrs. Jewls before class started.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Dana?\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can I leave the room when you read today?\" asked Dana.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because I hate stories,\" said Dana. \"They make me laugh and cry too much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t hate stories, Dana,\" Mrs. Jewls told her. \"You love stories. I wish everybody laughed and cried as much as you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Really?\" asked Dana. She couldn\u0027t believe it. All\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 76\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e this time she thought she hated stories when really she loved them. She was glad she really loved stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly she made a face. \"Oh, yuck!\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What if I really love John, too?\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56870.html","bookId":626,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:29 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:29 AM"}
