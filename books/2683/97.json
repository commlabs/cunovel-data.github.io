The sommelier I\u0027d befriended by ordering a $200 bottle of semi-decent red wine asked if I wanted to join the Mashioki family at the captain\u0027s table instead of sitting alone and I told Bernard that I simply couldn\u0027t, hinting at an indiscretion I\u0027d committed with the Mashiokis\u0027 eldest daughter, a fat, dour teenager who was always wandering near the ship\u0027s kennels wearing an UP WITH LIFE T-shirt, visiting her \"cat.\" The sommelier nodded gravely, brought me another small tin of Beluga, recommended the foie gras, went back to the business of his life while I slipped into my noncommittal dining mode. Afterwards, I dropped another grand of Palakon\u0027s at the 21 table and found the cinematographer, Felix, at the Captain\u0027s Bar, hunched over a giant snifter of brandy and chain-smoking Gauloises. I sidled up next to him and we had the obligatory \"ominous\" conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the story?\" I asked, after ordering a split of champagne, maybe my tenth on that particular evening. \"You\u0027re the guy shooting this, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could say that,\" Felix said in a thick, not-quite-traceable accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did,\" I pointed out. \"How\u0027s it going? I just want your professional opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is going better than the last one I did,\" Felix muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A picture called Shh! The Octopus.\" He paused. \"It was the third part of a soon to be completed quartet funded by Ted Turner that began with Beware! The Octopus, which was followed by Watch Out! The Octopus. The fourth part is called, tentatively, Get the Hell Away from That Octopus.\" Felix sighed again, distracted, and stared into his snifter. \"The third one had a good cast. A very bitter Kristin Scott Thomas, an equally bitter Alan Alda, and Al Sharpton had signed on to play Whitney Houston\u0027s extremely bitter father-the bitter harpoonist.\" Felix paused. \"David Hasselhoff is the first victim of the octopus.\" Pause. \"Isn\u0027t it ironic, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause occurred while I tried to process this information. Confused, I broke it hesitantly. \"So-o-o... the octopus\u0027s name was... Shh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix glared at me, then finally sighed, waved to the bartender for another, even though he hadn\u0027t finished the brandy sitting in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How am I doing?\" I asked expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027ll do,\" he sighed and then paused before phrasing carefully: \"You have a... kind of... nonspecific... fabulosity-oh my god...\" He groaned as his head dropped onto the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was looking around, not paying attention to all the faux-angst emanating from the cinematographer. \"This isn\u0027t exactly what you\u0027d call Babesville, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about time you gave up your foolish dreams, Victor,\" Felix said sternly, lifting his head. \"Your world\u0027s a little limited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s that, bro?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you read the rest of the script?\" he asked. \"Don\u0027t you know what\u0027s going to happen to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh man, this movie\u0027s so over.\" A semi-restlessness was settling in and I wanted to take off. \"I\u0027m improvising, man. I\u0027m just coasting, babe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just be prepared,\" Felix said. \"You need to be prepared.\" He gulped down the rest of his brandy and watched intently as the bartender set the new snifter in front of him. \"You need to pay attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This really isn\u0027t happening,\" I yawned. \"I\u0027m taking my champagne elsewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" Felix said. \"Things get mildly... er, hazardous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying, Felix?\" I sighed, sliding off the barstool. \"Just make sure I\u0027m lit well and don\u0027t play any colossal tricks on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried that the project is... ill-conceived,\" he said, swallowing. \"The writers seem to be making it up as it goes along, which normally I\u0027m used to. But here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking my champagne elsewhere,\" I sighed, tossing him a $100 chip from the casino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think things will be getting out of hand,\" he said faintly before I wandered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn bed I finally had the sense to just smoke a large joint while listening on my Walkman to a bootleg Nirvana tape that Jerry Harrington had loaned me, and the live feed of the ship heading straight into darkness on the TV was the only light in the cabin as a dead guy sang me to sleep, dreams intervening, peaking with a voice shouting out, then fading, hello? hello? hello? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-97.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
