He kept his sailboat moored there but couldn’t remember the last time he’d taken her out. The air was crisp and clean, and he breathed deeply as he strolled over to the waterfront. Sailboats and motorboats of various sizes were secured in their slips, bobbing gently, peacefully, in the dark-green waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of his name, he turned to see his father walking toward him. Seth smiled. He’d always been close to his family. He and his father had once been partners in a fishing enterprise, which took them to Alaska for a number of months each year. The money was good, but the work was dangerous, and when Justine came into his life, Seth knew it was time to make a career change. His father’s help had been instrumental in starting the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You spoke with the sheriff?” Leif Gunderson asked when he joined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth nodded. He hadn’t mentioned this to his father, which meant Leif had been talking to Justine. “There’s nothing new to report about how the fire was set—we already know that—or by whom. The inspector found a pewter cross in the ashes. That’s the biggest news. But I have no idea who it belongs to and we can’t be sure it’s even connected to the arsonist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeif frowned, as if pondering this latest bit of information. They sat on a park bench outside the marina. “How are things at home?” his father asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth figured his wife had given him an earful. Then again, it wasn’t like Justine to share their personal problems with others. “What makes you ask?” Seth murmured. He reached down and picked up a pebble and threw it into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father picked one up, too, and tossed it toward the cove. “I didn’t mean to pry. It’s just that you looked like you wanted to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once Seth realized he did need to confide in someone. Someone who knew him well, yet could maintain a perspective on the whole situation and everyone involved. Someone whose advice he trusted. Who else but his father? Sighing deeply, Seth braced his elbows on his knees. “Justine and I had an argument this morning. It wasn’t over anything important. We’re both on edge these days with the fire and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father didn’t respond for a moment. “That doesn’t sound good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The problem is, I don’t know what to do with myself these days. I wanted to start rebuilding as soon as possible. Then, a couple of weeks ago, Justine dropped this bombshell about not being sure rebuilding was such a good idea. She seems to believe we should just forget about the restaurant.” Seth lowered his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sucked in his breath and waited for his father’s reaction. He assumed Leif would react the same way he had—with shock and disbelief. The fact that he didn’t immediately say anything surprised him. “So, what do you think?” Seth pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father leaned back, closing his eyes. “Did she give you a reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth had been too shocked to take in much of what Justine had said. At the time, he’d figured it was simply her way of dealing with the aftermath of the fire. “My wife is talking nonsense,” he said. “We need the restaurant. It’s how we make our living. Okay, she’s right—I do put in a lot of hours and the work is demanding. The profit margin isn’t exactly what we’d hoped, but we were doing pretty well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at his father, but Leif still didn’t give any indication of what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s total nonsense,” Seth insisted a second time. “Of course we should rebuild!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you plan to do while you’re waiting for everything to come together?” his father asked instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Seth had the answer to that, he wouldn’t be hanging around the marina. “I don’t know.” This gave the matter of rebuilding top priority in his mind. Filling his days with the reconstruction project would ease his depression. Seth had been raised with a strong work ethic; he’d worked summers and after school from the time he was thirteen. He didn’t know what to do with himself when he wasn’t working. Outside of his role as a husband and father, his identity, his sense of who he was, came from what he did. Without work, he had no purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeif quirked a brow in his direction. “Do you love Justine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat question came as another shock. “More than my life.” Seth had loved her when they were in high school and he’d carried a torch for her years afterward, too. She’d gone off to college and he’d half expected her to marry some rich boy there. But she’d returned to Cedar Cove, starting work at the bank. He’d never believed she would love him, didn’t even think it was a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might listen to her, then,” his father advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do listen, but she’s talking foolishness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might be listening, but you’re not hearing her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that, Seth turned to stare at his father. “You’re saying I should let all those years of work go down the drain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’m saying you need to listen to your wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What am I supposed to do?” Seth flared. Everyone seemed to have an opinion but no one had offered him a solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father didn’t answer. A moment later, he casually continued the conversation. “I was talking to Larry Boone the other day,” Leif said as he tossed another pebble in the water. “You remember Larry, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth nodded. His father had purchased a fishing boat from the other man. Seth had owned a half interest in the boat and when they sold it, they’d invested that money in the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Larry’s looking for a salesman and asked if I’d be interested in coming out of retirement. The way he figured it, I’d been around fishing and boats all my life. He’s selling pleasure crafts, too, and offered me a commission that sounded almost too good to be true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth thought his father was probably glad of an excuse to go back to work. Adjusting to retirement hadn’t been as easy as he’d assumed it would be. “Are you going to do it?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I considered it,” his father said, grinning. “But then I talked to your mother, and she was dead set against it.” Leif rubbed the side of his face. “She’s been waiting all these years for us to travel. She’s got her heart set on buying one of those RVs and driving across the country. She isn’t about to let me take up a second career at this stage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth chuckled, understanding his father’s advice. “So that’s the reason you’re telling me I need to listen to my wife. You’re listening to yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father chuckled, too. “You know your mother. When she wants something, she makes sure I hear about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth did know and love his mother, and he had to agree she generally found ways of getting what she wanted. He loved the give and take of his parents’ marriage, and their ability to compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t much like the idea of driving one of those battleships,” Leif admitted, “but I’ll do it, and by the time we get back, my guess is I’ll be able to park that thing as slick as any boat I ever steered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth didn’t doubt it for an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I phoned Larry this morning,” he went on, “and told him I had to refuse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was he disappointed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was,” Leif said, “so I gave him your number and suggested he call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” Seth asked. “You think I can sell boats?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? You know as much about fishing as I do, and what you don’t know about pleasure crafts you can learn. The money’s good, and it’ll help you fill in the time until you decide about the restaurant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth needed to talk to Justine. This idea suddenly seemed right to him, but he wanted a few days to mull it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat with his father a while longer, chatting companionably about friends and neighbors, then headed home. Justine was vacuuming when Seth walked in and didn’t hear him. He stopped to admire her as she worked. Her long hair flowed unrestrained down her back and her lithe body moved gracefully as she pushed the vacuum cleaner. Justine’s concentration on any task was always complete; it was one of the many traits he loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regretted their argument and was sorry for the things he’d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned and saw him standing just inside the door, she jumped, startled. “Seth!” She switched off the vacuum cleaner. “When did you get home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just now.” He walked toward her. “Where’s Leif?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Preschool. I need to pick him up in half an hour.” Her gaze didn’t meet his as she swept the hair away from her face. “Did the sheriff have any news?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “He showed me a picture of a pewter cross. You might take a look and see if you recognize it, although there’s no guarantee it’s connected to the arsonist.” He paused. “If the sheriff doesn’t get any leads from that, I feel we should contact Roy McAfee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine didn’t respond to any of those statements. “I’m sorry about this morning,” she murmured instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am, too.” He walked toward her, and she stepped into his embrace. “We need to talk,” he said, holding her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about if I take you and Leif out for lunch,” he said. “I ran into Dad, and he had a suggestion I want to discuss with you.” He went on holding her. For the first time, he saw clearly that his anger was putting their marriage at risk. He loved Justine and his son. Dammit! He wasn’t going to lose them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia Lockhart-Griffin wondered if job shadowing was such a good idea. The high-school guidance office had contacted her a couple of weeks earlier to make the arrangements, and in a moment of weakness she’d agreed. The high-school girl sitting in front of her looked terribly young, but her eyes glowed with sincerity and keen interest. Olivia had believed in the justice system as a girl of that age, and she did now. The difference was that years of experience had shown her its weaknesses as well as its strengths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’d like to be an attorney?” Olivia glanced down at the girl’s name on the sheet of paper. “Allison?” she added. Allison Cox. Cox. That name sounded vaguely familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Judge, I would,” Allison said, her back straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any particular reason?” Olivia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl nervously flipped a strand of dark hair over her ear. “I’m hoping to learn how to use the law to help someone who doesn’t have a lot of options.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia nodded. It sounded as if the girl had a personal agenda; however, there wasn’t time to delve into that now. She needed to get to court. “I’ll be spending the morning in court, listening to a variety of cases. You can sit in the jury box near the court reporter. We’ll take a short break midmorning, and then stop for lunch around noon. I have a luncheon engagement with my mother. You’re welcome to join us if you’d like, and then we’ll return to court about one-thirty.” She smiled at the girl, who nodded. “Depending on the cases, I generally stop for the day at four. I stay a bit longer to read case files for the next day, but you’ll be free to go then.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/6-rainier-drive-cedar-cove-6/page-11.html","bookId":1947,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM"}
