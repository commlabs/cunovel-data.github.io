There came nights when he didn\u0027t appear at all. The boys said he had gone on most important errands. The house must run as if he were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slept in his empty bed, and no one questioned me. I searched the house for any personal trace of him. Questions plagued me. I feared he would never come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he always came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he came up the stairs, I flew into his embrace. He caught me, held me, kissed me and only then let me fall gently against his hard chest. My weight was nothing to him, though I seemed to grow taller and heavier every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would never be anything but the seventeen-year-old boy you see now, but how could a man so slight as he heft me with such ease? I am not a waif and never have been. I am a strong child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked it best-if I had to share with the others-when he read to us aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurrounding himself with candelabra, he spoke in a hushed and sympathetic voice. He read The Divine Comedy by Dante, the Decameron by Boccaccio, or in French The Romance of the Rose or the poems of Francois Villon. He spoke of the new languages we must understand as well as we understood Greek and Latin. He warned us that literature would no longer be confined to the classic works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence around him, on pillows, or on the naked tile. Some of us stood near him. Others rested back on their heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes Riccardo played the lute for us and sang those melodies he\u0027d learned from his teacher, or even the wilder ribald tunes he\u0027d picked up in the streets. He sang mournfully of love and made us weep over it. The Master watched him with loving eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no jealousy. I alone shared the Master\u0027s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, he even had Riccardo sit outside the bedroom door and play for us. Obedient Riccardo never asked to come inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart raced as the curtains closed around us. The Master pulled open my tunic, sometimes even ripping it playfully, as if it were no more than a castoff thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank into the satin quilted down beneath him; I opened my legs and let my knees caress him, numbed and vibrating from the graze of his knuckles against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I lay half asleep. The air was rosy and golden. The place was warm. I felt his lips on mine, and his cold tongue move serpentlike into my mouth. A liquid filled my mouth, a rich and burning nectar, a potion so exquisite that I felt it roll through my body to the very tips of my outstretched fingers. I felt it descend through my torso and into the most private part of me. I burned. I burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master,\" I whispered. \"What is this trick now which is sweeter than kissing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid his head down on the pillow. He turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it to me again, Master,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did, but only when he chose, in droplets, and with red tears he now and then let me lick from his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think a whole year passed before I came home one evening, flushed from the winter air, dressed in my very finest dark blue for him, with sky blue stockings and the most expensive gold enameled slippers that I could find in all the world, a year before I came in that night and threw my book into the corner of the bedroom with a great world-weary gesture, putting my hands on my hips and glaring at him as he sat in his high thick arch-back chair looking at the coals in the brazier, putting his hands over them, watching the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now,\" I said cockily and with my head back, a very man of the world, a sophisticated Venetian, a prince in the Marketplace with an entire court of merchants to wait on him, a scholar who had read too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now,\" I said. \"There\u0027s a great mystery here and you know it. It\u0027s time you told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he asked obligingly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you never . . . Why do you never feel anything! Why do you handle me as if I were a poppet? Why do you never...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time ever I saw his face redden; I saw his eyes gloss and narrow and then widen with reddish tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, you frighten me,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it you want me to feel, Amadeo?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re like an angel, a statue,\" I said, only now I was chastened and trembling. \"Master, you play with me and I\u0027m the toy that feels all things.\" I drew nearer. I touched his shirt, sought to unlace it. \"Let me-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my hand. He took my fingers and put them to his lips, and drew my fingers inside his mouth, caressing them with his tongue. His eyes moved so that he was looking up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite enough, said his eyes. I feel quite enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d give you anything,\" I said imploringly. I put my hand between his legs. Oh, he was wonderfully hard. That was not uncommon, but he must let me take him further; he must trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his unaccountable strength he drew me back with him to the bed. You could hardly say he\u0027d risen from the chair. It seemed we were there one moment and now fallen amongst our familiar pillows. I blinked. It seemed the curtains closed around us without his touching them, some trick of the breeze from the open windows. Yes, listen to the voices from the canal below. How voices sing out and up the walls in Venice, the city of palaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo,\" he said, his lips on my throat as they\u0027d come a thousand times, only this time there came a sting, sharp, swift and gone. A thread stitched into my heart was jerked all of a sudden. I had become the thing between my legs, and was nothing but that. His mouth nestled against me, and again that thread snapped and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dreamed. I think I saw another place. I think I saw the revelations of my sleeping hours which never stayed for me when I awoke. I think I trod a road into those bursting fantasies I knew in sleep and sleep alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what I want of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you must have it,\" I said, words propelled to the near forgotten present as I floated against him, feeling him tremble, feeling him thrill to it, feeling him shudder, feeling him whip these threads from inside me, quickening my heart and making me nearly cry out, feeling him love it, and stiffen his back and let his fingers tremble and dance as he writhed against me. Drink it, drink it, drink it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke loose and lay to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I lay with closed eyes. I felt my lips. I felt the barest bit of that nectar still gathered on my lower lip, and my tongue took it up and I dreamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breathing was heavy and he was somber. He shivered still, and when his hand found me it was unsteady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" I said smiling still, and kissing his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hurt you!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, not at all, sweet Master,\" I answered. \"But I hurt you! I have you, now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo, you play the devil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want me to, Master? Didn\u0027t you like it? You took my blood and it made you my slave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"So that\u0027s the twist you put on it, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm. Love me. What does it matter?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never tell the others,\" he said. There was no fear or weakness or shame in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned over and drew up on my elbows and looked at him, at his quiet profile turned away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would they do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"It\u0027s what they would think and feel that matters. And I have no time or place for it.\" He looked at me. \"Be merciful and wise, Amadeo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time I said nothing. I merely looked at him. Only gradually did I realize I was frightened. For one moment it seemed that fear would obliterate the warmth of the moment, the soft glory of the radiant light swelling in the curtains, of the polished planes of his ivory face, the sweetness of his smile. Then some higher graver concern overruled the fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not my slave at all, are you?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, almost laughing again. \"I am, if you must know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened, what did you do, what was it that-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid his finger on my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think me like other men?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, but the fear rose in the word and strangled out the wound. I tried to stop myself, but before I could I embraced him and tried to push my face into his neck. He was too hard for such things, though he cradled my head and kissed the top of it, though he gathered back my hair, and let his thumb sink into my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some day I want you to leave here,\" he said. \"I want you to go. You\u0027ll take wealth with you and all the learning I\u0027ve been able to give you. You\u0027ll take your grace with you, and all the many arts you\u0027ve mastered, that you can paint, that you can play any music I ask of you- that you can do already-that you can so exquisitely dance. You\u0027ll take these accomplishments and you\u0027ll go out in search of those precious things that you want-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want nothing but you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-and when you think back on this time, when in half-sleep at night you remember me as your eyes close on your pillow, these moments of ours will seem corrupt and most strange. They\u0027ll seem like sorcery and the antics of the mad, and this warm place might become the lost chamber of dark secrets and this might bring you pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember then that it was love,\" he said. \"That this indeed was the school of love in which you healed your wounds, in which you learnt to speak again, aye, even to sing, and in which you were born out of the broken child as if he were no more than an eggshell, and you the angel, ascending out of him with widening, strengthening wings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if I never go of my own free will? Will you pitch me from some window so that I must fly or fall? Will you bolt all shutters after me? You had better, because I\u0027ll knock and knock and knock until I fall down dead. I\u0027ll have no wings that take me away from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a study of me for the longest time. I never had such an unbroken feast on his eyes myself, and had never been let to touch his mouth with my prying fingers for such a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he rose up next to me and pressed me gently down. His lips, always softly pink like the inner petals of blushing white roses, turned slowly red as I watched. It was a gleaming seam of red that ran between his lips and then flowed through all the fine lines of which his lips were made, perfectly coloring them, as wine might do, only it was so brilliant, this fluid, that his lips shimmered, and when he parted them, the red burst as if it were a curled tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head was lifted. I caught it with my own mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world moved out from under me. I listed and drifted, and my eyes opened and saw nothing as he shut his mouth over mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, I die from this!\" I whispered. I tossed under him, seeking to find some firm place in this dreamy intoxicating void. My body churned and rolled with pleasure, my limbs tightening then floating, my whole body issuing from him, from his lips, through my lips, my body his very breath and his sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came the sting, there came the blade, tiny and sharp beyond measure, puncturing my soul. I twisted on it as if I\u0027d been skewered. Oh, this could teach the gods of love what love was. This was my deliverance if I could but survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlind and shaking I was wed to him. I felt his hand cover my mouth, and only then heard my cries as they were muffled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my hand around his neck, pressing him against my throat all the harder, \"Do it, do it, do it, do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I awoke, it was day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was long gone, as was his infallible custom. I lay alone. The boys had not yet come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out of bed and went to the high narrow window, the kind of window which is everywhere in Venice, locking out the fierce heat of summer and sealing off the cold Adriatic winds when they inevitably come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unbolted the thick glass panels and looked out on the walls across from my safe place as I had often done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common serving woman shook her cloth mop from a far balcony above. Across the canal, I watched her. Her face seemed livid and crawling, as if some tiny species of life covered her, some rampage of ants. She didn\u0027t know! I laid my hands on the sill and looked ever more keenly. It was only the life inside her, the workings of the flesh in her that made the mask of her face seem to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut horrid her hands seemed, knuckled and swollen, and the dust from her broom engraving every line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. She was too far from me for these observations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a faraway room, the boys talked. Time for work. Time to get up, even in the palazzo of the night Lord who never checks or prods by day. Too far away for me to hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this velvet now, this curtain made of the Master\u0027s favorite fabric, this was like fur to my touch, not velvet, I could see each tiny fiber! I dropped it. I went for the looking glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had dozens of them, great ornate mirrors, all with fancified frames and most replete with tiny cherubs. I found the tall mirror in the anteroom, the alcove behind warped yet beautifully painted doors where I kept my clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light of the window followed me. I saw myself. But I was not a seething corrupt mass, such as this woman had seemed. My face was baby smooth and starkly white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want it!\" I whispered. I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is when he came that night. I ranted and paced and cried out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t give me long explanations, no sorcery or science, either of which would have been so easy for him. He told me only I was a child still, and there were things to be savored which would be lost forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried. I didn\u0027t want to work or paint or study or do anything in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s lost its savor for a little while,\" he said patiently. \"But you\u0027d be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At how much you\u0027ll lament it when it\u0027s gone utterly, when you are perfect and unchangeable like me, and all those human mistakes can be triumphantly supplanted by a new and more stunning series of failures. Don\u0027t ask for this, not again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have died then, curled up, black and furious and too bitter for words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wasn\u0027t finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo,\" he said, his voice thick with sorrow. \"Say nothing. You don\u0027t have to. I\u0027ll give it to you quickly enough when I think the time has come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that I went to him, running, childlike, flinging myself at his neck, kissing his icy cheek a thousand times despite his mock-disdainful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last his hands became like iron. There was to be no blood play this night. I must study. I must make up the lessons I had scorned by day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to see to his apprentices, to his tasks, to the giant canvas on which he\u0027d been working, and I did as he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut well before morning, I saw him change. The others had long gone to bed. I was turning the pages of the book obediently when I saw him staring, beastlike, from his chair, as if some ravener had come into him and banished all his civilized faculties and left him thus, hungry, with glazed eyes and reddening mouth, the glittering blood finding its myriad little paths over the silky margin of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose, a drugged thing, and came towards me with a rhythm of movements that was alien and struck the coldest terror in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers flashed, closed, beckoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to him. He lifted me in both hands, clutching my arms ever so gently, and tucked his face against my neck. From the soles of my feet up my back through my arms and my neck and scalp, I felt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere he flung me I didn\u0027t know. Was it our bed or some hasty cushions he found in another closer salon? \"Give it to me,\" I said sleepily, and when it came into my mouth, I was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-3.html","bookId":2214,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:56 PM"}
