After all, his existence was one of even more leisure than before. Whether it was the construction of the imperial city, or the various arrangements with the Saint-Emperor Dynasty and the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, it was all handled by subordinates.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter the bedraggled Prince Ur-Demon and Reverend Devourer were released and sent back to the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, an even greater influx of Heavenspan Realm cultivators arrived.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavenspan Realm’s immortal domain was becoming a very busy and bustling place. Cities were popping up left and right, and mountain ranges were being raised up everywhere to create defensive borders.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun wanted to go talk things over with Hou Xiaomei, but she was being watched like a hawk by Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, and had been assigned a whole retinue of servants by the Grand Heavenmaster, who treated her like an official imperial concubine. Unfortunately, she was a lot less free than when she had been with Gongsun Wan’er.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHou Xiaomei was not very happy with how things were going, and that was made worse by the bellies of Zhou Zimo and Song Junwan. Therefore, she intentionally ignored Bai Xiaochun, and continued to try to come up with a plan about what to do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bai Xiaochun realized that Hou Xiaomei was avoiding him, he went to Gongsun Wan’er to ask her for her opinion. But Gongsun Wan’er was a celestial, a lofty status that required a certain level of decorum. Furthermore, she had been severely injured recently, and had already gone into secluded meditation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It’s definitely better to have only one wife!” Bai Xiaochun thought, sighing bitterly. The entire immortal domain was abuzz with activity, with the exception of Bai Xiaochun himself, who sat alone in his grand hall, sighing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, things didn’t stay like that for long. A month later, as the population continued to rise, the imperial city was finally finished!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a grand and magnificent location, which from a distance appeared to be like nine mountain ranges all meeting together in a central location! In the spot where they joined together, there was a huge statue.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe statue depicted Bai Xiaochun, wearing imperial robes. In his left hand, he held an enormous city, and in his right hand was a gigantic globe of water!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat was no ordinary water; it was water from the Eternal Sea!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, that counted for almost nothing compared to what the Grand Heavenmaster and other powerful members of the senior generation had done. They had scoured all of the Eternal Immortal Domains, including the sea itself and the Eternal Island, to find the bits of rubble and rocks that were actually the flesh and blood of the first generation Arch-Emperor, whose body had exploded when the original Heavenspan Realm was destroyed! It was all an effort to commemorate that first generation Arch-Emperor!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they couldn’t find every last bit of rubble, they found quite a bit, all of which became part of the huge statue of Bai Xiaochun. As a result, that statue had strange and wondrous powers!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnyone with the blood of the Heavenspan Realm that got close to the statue would feel their blood surging. It would make cultivation easier, and would provide a boost to both their battle prowess and their spirit enhancement abilities!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe most eye-catching thing about the statue was the imperial city held in its left hand!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven from a distance, it looked large and majestic. It could house millions upon millions of cultivators, and was filled with countless buildings and streets.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJust being in the city itself would provide great benefit to anyone with the blood of the Heavenspan Realm. Of course, the Grand Heavenmaster and his contemporaries wouldn’t forget the defenses of the city. There were numerous spell formations built into the statue to protect it and the city. Although the spell formations were not quite as powerful as those in Vile-Emperor City or Saint-Emperor City, they were still the type that celestials couldn’t easily do anything to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of that was definitely astonishing, but there was something else that was even more so. In the forehead of the statue of Bai Xiaochun… was his Heavenspan Dharma Eye!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, it looked like a radiant, violet crystal. If one got closer, though… it was possible to see that it wasn’t a crystal, but rather, a convergence of dazzling violet light!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithin that shocking violet light was… a violet imperial palace!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was exquisite and luxurious, and also pulsed with an energy that would inspire awe in anyone who laid eyes on it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Bai Xiaochun was sitting on the Dragon Throne in the grand hall. Arranged one level lower than his throne were three Phoenix Chairs, where Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo, and Hou Xiaomei all sat. The three of them would occasionally size each other up, and occasionally look over at him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Bai Xiaochun looked out at the hundred or so people who were currently standing around the main hall, arguing with each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me! We need to call it Emperor Bai’s Dynasty!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“No, that name won’t do. How could that be passed down to successive generations? We should call it Emperor Heavenspan’s Dynasty!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Have you people forgotten that our founding ancestor was the Arch-Lord? We should continue to honor him, and call it the Arch-Emperor Dynasty!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmong the people arguing in the hall were the Grand Heavenmaster, the Giant Ghost King, the Nine Serenities King, the Spirit Advent King, the War Champion King, and the demigods from the eastern and northern Heavenspan region. There were also a dozen or so demigods who had defected from the other two imperial dynasties.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Wan’er was present, but didn’t partake in the discussion. However, everyone else did, even Patriarch Spirit Stream. Because of his unique status, many people gave a lot of weight to what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly Li Qinghou hadn’t given his opinion yet. Given his special connection to Bai Xiaochun, anything he said would be taken very seriously, even by the Grand Heavenmaster, and therefore, he decided to wait.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun sighed as the arguments over the name of their nation went on for two days without anyone coming to an agreement.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had their own ideas, and everyone had different ways of trying to get Bai Xiaochun to agree with them. After all, now that the Heavenspan Realm had control of an immortal domain, it was definitely important to officially establish the dynasty.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot doing so would have adverse effects on the populace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes glittered, and he slowly raised his hand and began waving it back and forth to get the attention of the crowd. He didn’t need to use any cultivation base power; although everyone was involved with the discussion, they were also keeping their eye on Bai Xiaochun to see if he would say something.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye… the ruckus faded into silence, and everyone looked over at Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was used to being the center of attention now, and therefore, looked out at the crowd and began to speak in a calm voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Before the previous Arch-Emperor passed away… he passed on his legacy to me….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“We’re all people of Heavenspan. We’ve risen up through countless deadly struggles, all to reach this point of stability. We should honor the Arch-Emperor’s wishes, and honor the founding Arch-Lord!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Enough with the arguing. As of today… the glory of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty has been restored. Daoist Heavenspan changed the fate of our home, but now, we will return things to how they should be!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“We arrived in the Eternal Immortal Domains tens of thousands of years late, but… we still got here!” By the time he finished his speech, he had risen to his feet. As of this moment everyone realized… that the Arch-Emperor Dynasty was being reestablished!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had their own ideas, but right now, Bai Xiaochun occupied the ultimate position of authority. What he said was law!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo one dared to disagree, and in fact, everyone had to admit that what he said made sense. The Grand Heavenmaster was the first to step forward, his face a bit flush, his eyes sparkling. In his heart, he was fully convinced that all his efforts over the years were not in vain!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eClasping hands, he bowed to Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Arch-Emperor!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNext, the Giant Ghost King, the Nine Serenities King, the northern and eastern demigods, and all of the other powerful experts likewise clasped hands and bowed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Arch-Emperor!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun didn’t even unleash a scrap of his cultivation base. Gongsun Wan’er, Zhou Zimo, Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei were all moved by his glory, and bowed deeply to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Spirit Stream and Li Qinghou were moved, and understood that from this moment on, Bai Xiaochun was the Arch-Emperor, one of the three emperors of the Eternal Immortal Domains. Taking deep breaths, they bowed deeply!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs their voices echoed out, the millions and millions of Heavenspan Realm cultivators who had been watching the grand hall closely could hear what was being said. All of them dropped to their knees to kowtow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Arch-Emperor!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Arch-Emperor!!!” Soundwaves rolled out from Arch-Emperor City in all directions as countless cultivators joined their voices together. Soon, the sound filled the entire immortal domain!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven the Vile-Emperor and the Saint-Emperor were now looking in the direction of Arch-Emperor City!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe celestials, demigods, and devas from the other two imperial dynasties, as well as countless other cultivators, were all deeply shaken. Everyone could tell that a new dynasty had risen to power!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven the mysterious Eternal Mother… seemed to open her eyes and look… at the third of her sons, who had finally returned!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1212\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1214\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1213","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
