My sex rippled frantically around him, grasping at the wide head of his penis with ravenous greed. Every withdrawal left me empty, every thick hot slide forced pleasure through my veins like a drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva. Christ.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon loomed over me in the moonlight, a darkly sexual fallen angel. His beautiful face was hard with lust as his eyes gleamed down at me. His arms strained with unappeased need, his torso chiseled by the tension in his muscles. “You keep sucking on my dick with that tight cunt of yours and you’ll make me come. Is that what you want, angel? You want me to fill you up before you take it all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” I exhaled in a rush, willing my core to relax its eager tightening. He rolled his hips, stroking into me, his breath hissing as I took more of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, Eva. Your cunt loves my cock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for the headboard, Gideon stretched over me, my legs trapped between us. Fully exposed and tilted back for his pleasure, I was helpless to do more than watch as he straightened his hips and sank the last few inches of his penis into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound that left me was a harsh wail, the pleasure so intense it hurt. Distantly, I heard Gideon curse, felt his powerful body shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You good?” he bit out, his teeth grinding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to catch my breath, my lungs expanding as much as they were able.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva.” He growled my name. “Are. You. Good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to speak, I reached for his hips, my fingers catching in his boxer briefs. I had a moment to think how hot that was, that he hadn’t bothered to undress either one of us …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he started fucking, his hips pistoning in a relentless tempo, his long thick cock plunging and withdrawing from root to tip in rapid-fire thrusts. Supporting his weight entirely with his arms and the tips of his toes, he powered into me, his rigid penis nailing me straight into the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came so hard my vision went black, my body seized with pleasure so intense I was locked in it, suspended in the powerful waves of erotic sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was inundated by the ferocious surge of my climax. My skin tingled from head to toe. Gideon paused on a downstroke, grinding into me, giving my body the steely length of his penis to grasp. My sex spasmed ecstatically around that delicious hardness, gripping him hungrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” Gideon bit out, “you’re milking my dick so hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook violently, fighting to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment I sagged into the mattress, replete, Gideon pulled his cock out of my trembling slit and left the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBereft, I lifted a hand to him. “Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hang on.” He shoved his boxer briefs all the way off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still hard, his cock rising high and proud, slick from my orgasm—but I wasn’t wet with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t come.” I was too languid to help when he stripped me of my underwear. Sliding a hand beneath my back, he lifted me and whipped my shirt over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips brushed over my brow. “You wanted fast and rough. I want slow and sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe levered over me again, this time settling into the cradle of my open arms and legs. The moment I felt his weight, his heat, his desire, I realized how much I wanted slow and sweet, too. The tears came then, finally, freed by the heat of his passion and the warmth of his love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re everything to me,” I cried, the words choked with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting his hips, Gideon tucked the tip of his penis into my cleft and pushed forward gently, taking time and care to fill me. His lips moved against mine, the stroke of his tongue somehow more erotic than the slide of his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold me,” he whispered, his arms curved beneath my shoulders and his hands cupping the back of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tightened my grip on him. His buttocks flexed against my calves as he drove into me, his sweat slicking my palms as I caressed his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” he murmured, his fingertips brushing my tears. “Do you feel it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the pleasure drift over his face as he moved within me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held him as he groaned, his body quivering in orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed the tears away when he cried silently along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I let go of my grief in the shelter of his arms, knowing that whether in joy or pain, Gideon was one with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t get over this place.” Cary set his hands on the railing that surrounded the wraparound deck and looked out over the water. Sunglasses shielded his eyes while the wind played with his hair. “This house is awesome. I feel like we’re miles from anyone. And the view … un-fucking-believable.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-140.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
