Before he could reassert himself, Verity scrambled on top of him, straddling him the way she would a stallion. He realized she was going to take matters into her own hands and he laughed triumphantly at her overwhelming excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, honey, I get the message. Just let me get these jeans off and I\u0027ll take care of everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Verity ignored him. She reached down to where his shaft sprang eagerly from the unbuttoned denims and grasped him. Then she lowered herself, trying to force him into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas groaned in frustration as she fumbled awkwardly. His desperate manhood collided with her thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help you,\" he growled, reaching down between her legs. He found her damp, tight opening with one hand and guided himself quickly to the entrance with the other. \"Now,\" he ordered, his voice thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Take me into you now. Show me what you want to do to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s fingers splayed wide on his chest and her head tipped back as she slowly started to ease herself down onto him. He barely survived the torture. He knew he wouldn\u0027t last more than a few seconds once he was inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dug his fingers into her round derriere and forced her to complete the union. She gasped as he invaded her fully. She rose and fell twice, three times, and then her nails sank deep into his skin as she cried out and convulsed around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet hell,\" Jonas whispered, and then he exploded with white-hot violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions came later. Much later. Jonas lay with one arm around a drowsing Verity and stared at the shadow pattern on the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wise man did not look a gift horse in the mouth, he told himself. He was fortunate to find himself in the middle of a torrid affair with a woman who wanted him so much she had practically raped him tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had made love to her on only three occasions but she seemed to have become addicted to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically, he should be thanking his lucky stars that he was the man who had awakened the sleeping tigress, and who was now in a position to enjoy the pleasures of tiger taming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jonas was experiencing an inexplicable uneasiness. He had never trusted much in luck. He was a believer in the iceberg theory of the universe: never take anything at face value. Regardless of what showed on the surface, you could bet there remained a lot of unexplained territory underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow as he lay physically satiated beside Verity he found himself questioning what had not been evident during the passionate interlude that had just taken place. He was grateful for the experience, but he had to wonder just what had prompted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had responded to him as if she had just taken a potent aphrodisiac. She had come out of that psychic corridor this time as aroused and ready for sex as he was. Possibly even more so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\" Verity shifted against him, stretching like a contented cat. She opened her eyes and smiled dreamily up at him. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on his side and propped himself on one elbow, trying to read her expression. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful. How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drained,\" he admitted wryly. \"You take a lot out of a man, boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" She patted his shoulder and yawned hugely. \"You\u0027ve got a lot of resources to call upon in emergencies.\" She glanced at the clock. \"Good grief. Look at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re getting ready to kick me out again, forget it. I want to talk to you tonight, Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s start with sex,\" he suggested, feeling mildly aggressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we just finished with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save the cute remarks. I want to know what turned you on so completely tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled slyly and tapped one finger against his lower lip. \"That should be obvious. Feel free to take full credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to, but something tells me there was a little more involved than just my great charm and large muscles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile slipped and her eyes turned speculative. \"I know what you mean. I had the same impression the last two times you made love to me. There is a pattern here, isn\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at her, confused. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, the action causing her ni**les to push against the sheet. \"I\u0027m talking about the fact that the only times you\u0027ve ever made love to me were after a trip into that damn corridor. It seems to have a distinct effect on your libido. You haven\u0027t shown any interest in me outside of those two occasions, unless you count that kiss in the spa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was stunned. \"Are you telling me that your libido got overcharged tonight due to that test we ran?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her gaze toward the ceiling and pretended to yawn. \"This is going to be one unusual affair if it turns out the only time we get sexually excited is after a trip into the corridor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage flared in Jonas. \"I told you I wanted you that first night down in Mexico. I wanted you that night we kissed in the spa. And I\u0027ve wanted you every night in between.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Then how come we only wind up in bed on the nights you play psychic time voyager?\" she asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably because those are the times when my self-control is at its weakest,\" Jonas grated. \"The rest of the time I\u0027ve tried to take things easy and not push you. Don\u0027t you understand? Going into the corridor doesn\u0027t by itself make me horny. I never got a hard-on during all those tests at Vincent. My physical reaction is connected with you, not the psychometry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" She looked dubious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right. What about you? What was it that got you so excited tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relief, I suppose,\" she said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relief at getting through the test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head on the pillow. \"No. Relief that you didn\u0027t get shot inside that corridor.\" The wary, teasing tone was gone from her voice. Verity\u0027s expression was very serious as she stared up at the ceiling. \"I thought you were going to get killed in there. When we got out, all I wanted to do was throw myself on top of you and reassure myself that we were both all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas pondered her answer. \"I told you, I wasn\u0027t in any danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drummed his fingers impatiently on her sheet-covered thigh. \"You\u0027re saying you jumped on me out of a sense of relief after what we\u0027d gone through in the tunnel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. I\u0027m not sure I can explain it completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve been assuming I get turned on enough to take you to bed only after I\u0027ve been into the corridor?\" he persisted, wanting to get the facts straight before he decided what to do next. \"You think this affair of ours is dependent on frequent use of my psychometry?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-60.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
