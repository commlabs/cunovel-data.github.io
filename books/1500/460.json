Su’s body easily moved out of the way, at the same time sending his foot towards the manager’s calf, making him lose balance and fall onto the ground.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe last thing this manager reflected from his eyes was the edge of the heavy sword. The heavy sword in Madeline’s hand was raised, slicing up in reverse, directly cutting the manager diagonally in half.

The manager was still saying something with an unclear voice, his four limbs aimlessly moving about. Even though he was already no longer a threat, Su and Madeline who were looking at the cut simultaneously frowned slightly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the enormous cut across the manager’s body, there were unexpectedly only a few drops of dark purple liquid that seeped out. This already proved that his body was nearly devoid of water content!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWater was the source of all life, something that had already been deeply engraved in this world’s general knowledge. However, right now, this normal reasoning was being toppled right before Su and Madeline’s eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter observing for a bit, Su shifted his attention from the manager’s corpse to look around this room. He wasn’t a biochemistry specialist, nor was he an abnormal life form specialist, and neither was Madeline. This strange waterless manager was better off being given to a more suitable person, for example, Helen, to deal with. Of course, this would only be possible if they made it out from this place alive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu reached out his hand, removing a sticky note from the wall.

It is already summer on the surface, yet I can only sit here, pretending all day that the fluorescent light is sunlight, constantly enduring the coldness and gloominess. However, a month later, I will have fulfilled three years of work, and will have one month of vacation!

However, there were still a few notes that drew Su’s attention. After carefully reading them a few times, Su put them in order by time before reading them one more time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“... damn it, they cancelled my vacation, and they didn’t tell me when exactly I can take a vacation!

In the past, I was allowed to head down to the second floor at most… however, they still haven’t told me when I could go on vacation!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“... a rather easy week with not much work to do at all.

All of the organs that a human should have within his body disappeared, replaced with a dark purple organ that filled up his entire chest cavity. Fine tentacles reached out from this organ and extended to various parts of the body, all the way down to his fingertips. It seemed like it was these tentacles that were controlling the manager’s movements. However, the interior of that enormous organ was hollow, and from the manager’s lower back, a torn opening could be seen, as if something had left through this location.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu then carefully searched through this room, but he didn’t find anything valuable. He gave the manager’s dissected body a look before muttering, “Seems like he has become the host of some type of larva. We have to be a bit more careful, especially mindful of conserving stamina.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Don’t worry, I am going to have a new fifth level ability soon,” said the young lady.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter walking out from the manager’s work room, they found that the entire storeroom was extremely quiet. Aside from those flesh tubes that were rhythmically wriggling about, they didn’t see a single abnormal beast, as if they had all gone into hiding. Even those egg clusters that contained embryos stopped moving, as if out of fear of drawing Su’s attention.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu reviewed what he knew about the base’s layout, and then he walked towards the storehouse’s emergency exit. This small side door connected to two different passages, a maintenance elevator, as well as an emergency staircase. This complex terrain was, without a doubt, advantageous to Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu produced a steel wire from who knew where, winded it about the entrance, and then he reached his hand out to push open the side door. When the side door opened, he immediately dodged to the side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe wide open security door suddenly released a powerful blast of air, and then an abnormal creature threw itself into the storeroom with a speed that couldn’t be detected by the naked eye! It had clearly been hiding for a long time, waiting for prey to fall into its trap before adding a fatal blow! However, this charge of stored power instead landed it right in Su’s trap. Its body slammed ferociously into the two thin steel wires, the ferocious assault completely deforming the steel wiring, and then causing it to collapse. Even though its body was sturdy, after this full on collision, the steel wire still inflicted tremendous damage on its body. Its head was almost sliced in half, and the steel wire that entered its chest sliced through its sharp and powerful forelimbs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe strange creature released large amounts of blood as it collapsed onto the ground.
