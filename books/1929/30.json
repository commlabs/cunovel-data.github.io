As strange as it seemed, this was just what I wanted, what I needed, after that confession. There was no better way for him to show me that it hadn’t changed the way he felt for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worked himself in slowly, the pressure different, more intense, at this angle. He had to drag himself slowly out, then push back in a few times, adjusting the slant of my hips, before he began to pump into me in earnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands fisted in the sheets, my cheek flat to the bed, as he worked me from behind, his breathing heavy and harsh, loud enough to be heard even over my own uneven pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worked me so hard that his hips began to slam into me, making a slapping noise against my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a little shocked that there was no pain, only a pleasure building that was so big I wasn’t sure I could handle it. It was coming over me like a tidal wave, the sensations overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too—too much, Tristan,” I stammered, trembling with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sweetheart,” he panted, still driving into me, not even pausing. “Just let go. Let go for me, Danika.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let go. I let go of that thing inside of me that always wanted to cling to every ounce of control, and just let the waves of sensation wash over me, seeping into every pore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went over the edge trembling, gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tristan,” I nearly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danika,” he said softly, that one word full of intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rocked deep into me twice more before he came inside of me, shaking against my back, and repeating my name raggedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay on my back, his weight pushing me down. Softly, and oh so sweetly, he kissed my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat weight on me, at one time such a terror, was now just a solid reassurance. It was absolutely flooring what trust could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to suck your dick,” I said into his ear, deliberately crude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have been worn out. We both should have, but we couldn’t seem to get enough of each other. A few bouts of the best sex of my life had only made me hungry for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in the cards tonight,” he whispered back, confirming once and for all that he had superhuman control, since I could see that he was clearly hard. Again. “No more selfless acts from you. I couldn’t stand it if I realized at the end that you were just suffering through it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I pulled out my winning hand. “I’ve never done it before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went absolutely still, not moving or speaking for a solid minute. “Excuse me?” he finally said, pulling back to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked my lips slowly, drawing his attention there. “I’ve never sucked a cock before, and I’d like to suck yours. What do you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is that possible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The other…we just didn’t, and the two guys I’ve dated didn’t do oral, so I’ve never done it either…It only seemed fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s making the whole thing seem pretty fucking calculated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged one shoulder. “Am I wrong? Why should I do something they weren’t willing to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t talking about that. I was talking about this right here, with us. Are you only offering because I’ve done it for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slowly, my eyes never leaving him. “I want to. I want to know what you taste like. I want to feel you coming in my mouth. I want to make you feel good. You were upset with me earlier, when I got you off with no thought to myself, but I love doing that for you. It’s almost as good as when you do it for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You swear you want to do it? This isn’t some power play?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me hated that he knew me well enough to act like that, to know just the way my mind worked, but another part of me loved it. There was something so comforting in the certainty that someone knew about your biggest flaws and was still willing to stick around. “I swear it’s not. I’d like to try it.” I smiled my best siren’s smile, and I knew by the heat in his eyes that it was a good one. “Pretty please, may I suck your big cock?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t hold back his smile. “Now, how could I turn that down? You said pretty please, so I’m pretty sure I have to let you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True story,” I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still smiling as he came to his feet on the side of the bed, his own smiling face turned serious and harsh with intensity in a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get on your knees,” he said thickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, curious and puzzled as to what he planned, but very content to let him do the planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to him, which brought my face very close to his erection, and meant that his plan wasn’t all that complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fisted my hair, moving his velvety hard tip to rub along my bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open,” he told me, his breath hitching when I obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the tip in, and then a little more, filling my mouth. I started to tense as he reached the back of my throat, but his hand stroked over my hair, and his voice was soothing as he instructed me. “Relax. Just breathe through your nose and relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI calmed, his reassuring, confident tone all it took for me. My mouth was so full of him that, even with my mouth open wide, I still felt my teeth scraping against him as he pushed into the back of my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Careful there, sweetheart, I don’t mind a bit of pain, but easy on the teeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my lips over my teeth as he pushed himself in deeper, my mind distracted by the idea of him not minding a bit of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out and stroked into my mouth, and I was amazed at how much of him I could take, though he was careful not to gag me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t let up with the dirty dialogue for a second, his voice low and gravelly with need, which I found that I loved. “Your mouth feels so good. I’m not gonna last two minutes watching those gorgeous lips on my cock. Yeah, that’s it, take it deeper. Suck, baby, that’s right, suck it hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged one of my hands up from the bed, gripping it hard at his thick base. “Stroke me. Hard. Jack me off into your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, panting hard, as I obeyed, gripping his thick base hard, loving the feel of the hard smooth flesh in a way I’d never thought I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t forget the sight of you like this, on your hands and knees, your mouth filled with my cock, for as long as I live. You’re the hottest fucking thing on the planet, Danika.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name turned to a moan as he came in my mouth, warm liquid shooting down my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t pull out until he’d given me every shiver inducing spasm, but the second he did, he was pushing me to my back, his mouth burrowing between my legs, his magical hands busy everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan was the opposite of a selfish lover. Whatever he got, he gave back in spades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re loud,” he told me, when he’d wrung another glorious orgasm out of my system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried my best to muster up a decent glare. “So are you. You talk the whole time, when your face isn’t buried in my…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pussy? You draw the line at saying pussy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And yes, I talk the whole time. Quietly. Or at least, I’m not shouting loud enough to bring the house down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” I told him again, blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just grinned, pushing down until his bare chest was rubbing against mine. “You tired, boo? Do you need some rest?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. “Don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Eventually…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean? We couldn’t possibly…not again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hitched up one muscular shoulder in a shrug, circling his hips to let me feel that, unbelievably, he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just ate you out for ten minutes. It’s hard to stay unaffected by that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hooked my legs around him, grinding against him. We were skin on skin, him teasing at my entrance, and it felt amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned loudly as he pushed in that first perfect inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out just as quickly, going for another condom, having to dig through the covers to find one. I watched him roll it on like he did it every day, which he probably did, which I didn’t let myself think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved back into position, easing into me, whispering rough, dirty, sweet things to me all the while. “You feel so good. So fucking tight. I’ll let you rest after this time, but don’t be shocked when you wake up with my dick inside of you sometime in the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped, my only reaction to his words, since I wasn’t coherent enough to actually speak as he rocked in and out of me, the strokes long and perfect, and so smooth, considering he stretched me with his every movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pounded into me, harder and harder, not letting up, proving to me that I did like it rough, if Tristan was doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming. Are you close?” he demanded, pulling up to look at me, his face pained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmmm,” was the closest thing I had to an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached between us, his finger finding and circling my clit with unerring accuracy. It was impressive, how familiar he was with the female body, and impossible to get upset about how he’d gotten so familiar as he rocked my world, yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came, a gasping, toe curling orgasm, and he was right there with me, biting my lower lip, and then moving to growl rough compliments into my ear that made my whole body flush with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I didn’t wake up with Tristan inside of me. We never got the chance, as tiny fists started beating on the locked door of my bedroom before six a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat straight up, my eyes immediately shooting around the room, looking for clothes. I was decent by the time Tristan sat up, sheet falling to his waist, leaving his drool-inducing torso bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got this,” I told him. “You can go back to bed. I just need to go make the boys breakfast, and turn on a show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rushed into the bathroom before he could respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exited the bathroom through the rarely used hallway door, being considerate, in case Tristan had already fallen back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t, and no sooner had I found a TV station with cartoons than he was in the kitchen, starting in on breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got Mat settled, and approached the kitchen. I leaned a hip into the counter as he got about thirty ingredients out of the fridge, going all out as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the eggs near the oven, strode to me, grabbed me by the hips, and lifted me onto the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast a quick glance in Mat’s direction before slipping his hips between my legs. He pressed against me, and dipped his mouth down for a long, hot, drugging kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back when we were both out of breath, straining hard against each other. “First chance I get,” he rasped into my ear, “I’m going to bend you over the nearest piece of furniture, and make you lose your mind again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back on my hands, eyes closed, as I let myself process that. So this wasn’t over. There was more to come…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to the food, a grin on his face that would have been completely infuriating if it wasn’t also totally irresistible. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-things-tristan-danika-1/page-30.html","bookId":1929,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM"}
