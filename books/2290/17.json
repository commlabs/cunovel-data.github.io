I don\u0027t know what youthink you know, but I can guarantee you\u0027re wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really are,\" Maggie murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean set a hand on his wife\u0027s shoulder. \"Maggie,\" he cautioned, \"they need to solve this themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Solve it themselves?\" Maggie protested. \"His solution is to kill her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica didn\u0027t think Bryan had heard a word anyone had said since Sean had spoken her true name. He just stared at her. She felt an iciness, a fear she hadn\u0027t known in years. Not a physical fear. Something deeper. An attack against the remnants of her soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all jumped when, from up stairs, they heard a little-girl voice call out, \"Mommy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica made an instant decision. She turned to Maggie and Sean. \"We\u0027ve got to get out of your house and talk this out between one another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica, I can\u0027t let you leave here with him,\" Maggie insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be all right,\" Jessica said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie started to protest, but her husband cut her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You twodo need to work this out. Because we have a deadly situation on our hands. This Master has to be stopped, and both of you need to think about that before anything else. Am I making myself clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan turned to Sean. \"You\u0027re right.\" He looked at Maggie. \"Jessica has nothing to fear from me. At the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the moment!\" Maggie said, ready to do battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Jessica said, walking over to give her friend a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica slipped an arm casually through Maggie\u0027s, walking her toward the stairwell. \"I swear to you, I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be fine,\" Maggie whispered back. \"You\u0027re in love with him. You were before, you are now. And he\u0027ll lull you and seduce you-and kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Maggie. I\u0027m not that foolish. I\u0027ve survived this long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he hasn\u0027t known who or where you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, it works both ways,\" Jessica reminded her. \"I could kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could, but you won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, go take care of your daughter. I promise you, I\u0027ll be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie started up the stairs just as Sean and Bryan came up behind them. She paused, looking down in anger. \"You need to find new accommodations,\" she told Bryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie,\" Jessica said, \"Forget that for now. We need to focus on stopping the Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be back here by three this afternoon,\" Sean said. \"I\u0027ll have gathered what and who I can by then. We need a better plan than just waiting to see what he does next. Or,\" he added softly, \"who dies next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, back by three,\" Jessica said. She started out the door. Bryan followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have your car, I see,\" he commented, walking around to the passenger side. \"Is it your customary mode of transportation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mycustomary mode of transportation? Are you asking me if I can turn into mist? If I can shape-shift?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m assuming you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I? Yes. Do I? Not often. Only when necessary. I actually love my car. So get in, and let\u0027s get out of here,\" she said pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" she murmured a moment later, glancing casually his way as she pulled out of the driveway, \"what about you? Are you some superhero? Can you leap tall buildings in a single bound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only when necessary,\" he mocked. He was staring ahead at the road, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica, someone close to you has to be in on this with the Master. How well do you know Stacey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you even dare suggest it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? She knows you, knows your every move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica shook her head. \"You don\u0027t understand. I met Stacey through my church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yourchurch? \" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You reallydon\u0027t know anything, do you?\" she said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, but I\u0027ve come across very few vampires through the centuries who go to church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many have you asked?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not Stacey,\" she said heatedly. \"Stacey and Gareth have looked out for me for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, features drawn. \"Jessica, don\u0027t be such a fool. Years mean nothing to the Master.\" He was quiet for a moment. \"Dear God!\" he exploded. \"His hatred for me in life was madness. He didn\u0027t just want you dead, he wanted to turn you into pure evil simply because I loved you. Now his hatred for you is more powerful than any hunger. I blame myself for where we are now,\" he added bitterly. \"I should have known he was here. I should have watched over Mary myself from the minute she was bitten.I shouldn\u0027t have failed in Transylvania.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled by his pained tone, by the fact he seemed far angrier with himself than with her. He had spoken almost as if they could be allies again, almost as if he believed that there could be those who, though touched by the hand of evil, could still resist it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m to blame, not you,\" she said. \"Although blaming ourselves right now won\u0027t help anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So...who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is close to you and is helping the Master to carry out his plans? Let\u0027s say its not Stacey, nor Gareth, even though they\u0027re closest to you. And human. Just how long have you known them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the road. \"Gareth has been with me for a decade. Stacey, several years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bobby Munro,\" he said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bobby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I know him. He\u0027s always in my house, he loves Stacey. He\u0027s a good cop. You might as well suggest Big Jim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled when he remained silent. \"No, no, no,\" she said. \"He\u0027s one of the best men I\u0027ve ever met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Bryan was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, there\u0027s still the possibility we\u0027re looking for a stranger,\" she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. \"True. As we both know,\" he added dryly, \"almost anything ispossible . But it\u0027s not probable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t understand. I know the people around me. I\u0027ve been...I\u0027ve been around for centuries. I\u0027ve learned how to judge human nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of us ever really knows anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For an angel of goodness, you\u0027re quite a cynic,\" she informed him icily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not an angel,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. A warrior. For the forces of good. You might want to accept that there could be a little goodness in others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached her house; she pulled into the drive, turned off the engine, and they sat for a minute. He stared straight ahead, then finally he looked at her. \"I\u0027ll grant you this, the place is well vampire-proofed. So how come you\u0027re able to enter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t understand anything at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got out and headed straight for the porch, shoulders squared, indignant. He followed instantly, grabbing her arm, spinning her around. She was about to tell him where to go when she realized he wasn\u0027t even looking at her. He was staring at the house. \"Even here, you have to be careful.\" He frowned, jaw locked as he looked for danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a vampire here, and I don\u0027t mean you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set a hand on his arm before he could go racing in. \"Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right. We have her under control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"She has to be destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Look, I would have killed her myself the night she turned-you know that. Even I was convinced that she was evil. But she\u0027s not, Bryan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare go telling me again that there is no such thing as a good vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started in again, but he called her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying. Honest to God. But you\u0027d better warn Mary and all your little friends that one wrong move and theywill be eliminated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And may I suggest that if you act against any us without provocation, I can be equally ruthless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t doubt it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gritted her teeth, damning herself for feeding right into his beliefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize you\u0027re in even greater danger, now that you\u0027ve let Mary in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary will be sound asleep all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can enter her dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze, staring at him. Yes, the Master could enter dreams. He had entered hers, while she had foolishly imagined that it was Bryan who had somehow caused the nightmares of the past to plague her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in very serious danger here,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right-from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t lie. I said I wouldn\u0027t kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just a paragon of virtue,\" she taunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was surprised when he actually laughed. \"I wouldn\u0027t go that far. But my word is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued up the porch steps to the house. Stacey opened the door, and stared first at Jessica, then at Bryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything all right here?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey nodded, still looking anxious. \"Mary is as secure as...as secure as I know how to make her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is very secure,\" Jessica said firmly, a warning in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And I saw to it that she was completely stuffed. I mean, if she feels like she\u0027s just eaten an entire turkey dinner, she\u0027s less likely to fall prey to his call, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, she seems to have done a very good job of fighting him already. I haven\u0027t seen that happen before,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ithas happened before,\" Stacey said. \"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan made a skeptical sound in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Gareth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watching over Mary, Jeremy and Nancy. No matter how much Jeremy objects, if Mary makes any trouble, Gareth will take care of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, I\u0027m going to get some sleep,\" Jessica said. \"Stacey, make sure to wake me up by about two, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening now?\" Stacey asked worriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sean and Maggie are working a few angles,\" she said, and set a hand on Stacey\u0027s arm. \"They know what they\u0027re doing,\" she said softly. She spun and stared at Bryan. \"I\u0027m going to bed. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, she started up the stairs. When she reached her room, he was behind her. She turned on him heatedly. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really trust Stacey and Gareth so completely?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared back at him, shaking her head. \"Yes, I do. How have you managed to live so long without learning that sometimes you have to believe in other people? We don\u0027t exist alone. I don\u0027t. Iwon\u0027t .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into the room and started to close the door, but he had followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and I won\u0027t leave you. You\u0027re in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him. \"Maggie is certain that you are the greatest danger I\u0027m facing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s here for you,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked around the room, looking in the closet, the bathroom and under the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryan, he\u0027s hardly likely to be hiding under the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose. \"Nice bed. No coffin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one sleeps in a coffin anymore,\" she said. \"Well, all right, some do. But not the...the vampires I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"The old trunk under the bed? Scottish soil, I assume?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer turn to shrug. \"I\u0027m surprised you haven\u0027t already ripped my room to shreds to see what you could find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really didn\u0027t know at first,\" he admitted. \"My mind was on...other things. I should have known, though. Even after all these years...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no idea,\" she told him. \"Time...well, time can heal a lot of wounds. Except...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have known, she thought. I should have known when I felt...something I had never felt before or since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought the ridiculous desire to burst into tears. She had survived this long. But she had never thought she would see him again. She had been sure he was dead, but now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her expectantly for a moment, but when she didn\u0027t say anything more, he stepped out onto the balcony and stared up at the sky. After a moment, she joined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded gravely. \"He was, though. I thought it was my imagination that I was so intent on my pursuit I was conjuring him up, but it was real. It seems, however, that he can\u0027t enter.\" He looked at her. \"Either that, or he hasn\u0027t chosen to yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the first is correct,\" she said. \"Myfriends , the people who care about me, are very good at keeping me safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, but did they keep you safe from me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing could have kept me safe from you, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a vampire,\" she said dryly. \"Anyway, it\u0027s daytime. He has to rest now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he? You don\u0027t always rest by day, and you\u0027re both ancient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some women might take that the wrong way,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored the thrust. \"The point is, you\u0027re both strong, with powers few others will ever attain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. We\u0027reboth strong. He\u0027s not the only powerful one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still fear for you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fear for me-or fear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head but didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started back into the bedroom. He followed her, carefully locking the balcony doors. He took a long moment, staring at the garlic strings and intricate crosses that were strung there for protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever pause to think that if there is a supreme being who strives for peace that in the heart of every sentient creature, there is both evil and goodness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her by the shoulders, looking into her eyes. \"I know what I have seen,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But faith means believing in what wecan\u0027t see,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem to have much faith in me tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve admitted that one of your key aims in life is to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ve said I won\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to defeat the Master. For good, this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were still on her shoulders, his face close. Those eyes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had she not recognized those eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinct had told her what memory had failed to see, but when she trembled now, was it because of Maggie\u0027s warning or from passion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to resist him, dared not take a chance. But then he touched her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she told herself, she would have resisted but for a single whispered word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Igrainia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA name. And in that name, she heard a longing and poignancy that had outlasted the ages, the joy of what they had shared, what they had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t have turned away then even if he had aimed a stake straight at her heart. He cupped her chin in his hands, his fingers moving with an infinite tenderness over her cheeks. She didn\u0027t even realize she had moved, but she was suddenly pressed against him. He bent slowly, and his lips moved over hers. It was a full, slow kiss, lips parting, the fire of the ages evoked in the play of their tongues. Passion, simmering, slow but explosive, awoke. She reached up, her fingers winding through his hair, and they kissed with a growing madness. She never knew how clothing found its way to the floor. It seemed the kiss never broke, but it didn\u0027t matter, because they were naked in each other\u0027s arms. Nothing, nothing at all seemed to matter, except the heat that infused their flesh, melded them together so they could sate the frenzied hunger that seized them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen their lips at last parted, she kissed his throat, feeling the pulse there, then his collarbone, the rippling expanse of his chest. His fingers stroked her hair as she moved against him, remembering, discovering, showering him with liquid caresses. She moved ever lower, reveling in the feel of hard muscle and sleek skin, noting a scar here, there....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if time washed away. She felt a Highland wind as surely as if it touched her in truth. She drew her fingers around his hip, over his buttocks, and it was as if the colors of a distant valley lived with her again in springtime. She felt the roar of a storm, the crashing of the waves against the cliff, the hunger of innocence, trust...love....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stroked and caressed with fingers, lips and tongue. She teased mercilessly, those distant memories rising in her with the shuddering of his flesh, each tensing of his fingers as they brushed her hair and shoulders. She took him in her hands, in her mouth; she felt him tremble, and then she was in his arms, lifted and carried, then lying on the cool sheets, but in her mind and heart she might have lain in an age-old field of mauve and green. Where she had teased lightly at first, she was met now with urgency and raw desire, his hands and mouth moving over her as if everything that had come before was but a prelude for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had always been a magnificent lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he proved again, mouth upon hers, upon her body, raggedly teasing her breasts, her belly, between her thighs. Then he was atop her, within her, and the world beyond them was a storm, the sky blue and thunderous gray, the sheets a poignantly remembered wool, cast upon the rugged ground, and theirs was the passion of youth, of a love that had grown, flown and entwined them forever....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn life, in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet this was the now, and what he did to her was raw and carnal and explosive. The sheets beneath her were real, the sun high, and he was flesh and thunder within her. When sensation reached the point of eruption, she felt a climax shake her as if she had died again, this time in a rapture and sheer physical ecstasy that was staggering. She clung to him, amazed at the joy that continued to grip her so sweetly as she seemed to drift on silver clouds, down to earth, down to the bed, the sheets, the room in the house on Bourbon Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to him, beside her, there on the bed. Holding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then...the pain. Oh, God, the pain. Tears that stung her eyes. Tears she could not shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke softly. \"Perhaps, if you\u0027re going to do it, you should do it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he rose above her, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am avampyr . And you are a warrior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at her for a long time. \"Sometimes,\" he said at last, a rueful smile curving his lips, \"we have to go on faith, to believe that which we cannot see, hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased back beside her, pulling her against him. She lay still, thinking that if he were to kill her now, it wouldn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would happily die in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt his kiss brush her head, felt his fingers stroke through her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only...\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could stay like this forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn\u0027t. They both knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to speak, but he pressed his fingers to her lips, drawing her closer still. \"We have to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. She didn\u0027t dare move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had thought him dead and herself alone. She had fended for herself, made herself strong, and she had learned that she could face any danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he was here. Alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer greatest threat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his arms were around her now, and she felt, as she hadn\u0027t since they had last lain so, that she was cherished, protected, that...he would die for her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut tonight...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the future brought, she intended to savor the sensation, the belief, that she was loved, cherished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay secure in his arms, desperately tired. And finally she slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo dreams plagued her, only his whisper as he moved against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Igrainia.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kiss-of-darkness-alliance-vampires-7/page-17.html","bookId":2290,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM"}
