In the past, Blood Moon had done a favor for Eunuch Liang and there was even some friendship between them. The reason that Blood Moon came to Marvel Blue Imperial Palace was also because Eunuch Liang brought both sides together. Although Blood Moon could be said to be on a mission, the truth was that this was more a form of asylum. In Marvel Blue Imperial Palace, Blood Moon would be able to obtain some protection. Even so, she would have to return to Heaven’s Net sooner or later. That was where she had placed so much effort in these years to establish her own business and foundation, and there was also something there she needed to retrieve.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBefore Blood Moon entered the harem, Eunuch Liang had referred to her as ‘miss’.

He had even attempted to open the final smelting trial of the Asura Road, but, he had been too old and wasn’t able to obtain the qualifications to enter. Then, the Marvel Blue Emperor had gathered a group of top masters to explore one of the forbidden death zones of the inner Asura Road – the Forbidden Divine Barrens.

However, if Lin Ming’s master wasn’t willing to help, then just a junior like Lin Ming alone wouldn’t be of any assistance to her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThus, the second time that Lin Ming came to Full Moon Hall, she had only politely summoned him. She had a young eunuch lead Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian to a side hall and basically didn’t see him at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLike this, five days passed. Lin Ming still hadn’t seen Blood Moon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnd in Full Moon Hall, Lin Ming wasn’t even able to walk as he pleased. After all, there were women everywhere and if he wasn’t careful he would see far too much of their bodies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThings continuing like this was not a plan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Lin Ming was clear that if he couldn’t put out some sort of condition that could move Blood Moon, it was simply impossible for him to borrow her transcendent divine might for any period of time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThus, Lin Ming didn’t even mention the matter of the Celestial Tyrant Manual. He peacefully stayed at Full Moon Hall, either meditating, dual cultivating with Xiao Moxian, or practicing his divine runic arts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSlowly, a dozen some days passed. In the blink of an eye, Lin Ming had stayed in Full Moon Hall for half a month.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the early morning, a maid slammed the doors open to put down a basin of wash water. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian. As she saw their lazy and fulfilled appearances in bed, her eyes flashed with contempt.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe didn’t have to be a genius to know what the two of them had been doing last night.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe young maid also acknowledged that Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian could be considered a dragon and phoenix amongst humans, a match made by the heavens. But, they had freely eaten and slept here without any meaning or intention of leaving Full Moon Hall, and they had done so for half a month. Since it was her job to manage their daily needs she naturally wasn’t feeling happy that she had to do these extra duties.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMoreover, she could see that her master didn’t care too much about this young man and woman. Thus, she had faintly regarded Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian as simple freeloaders.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I must say… sir, miss, how long do you plan on living here?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis young maid was quite interesting. If she managed to be chosen to enter the Imperial Palace, she naturally wasn’t ugly. Rather, with her teenage appearance, she seemed quite pure and naïve.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming faintly smiled. He easily knew what this young maid was thinking. “What, are you in such a hurry to kick us out?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter having her thoughts revealed, the young maid wasn’t embarrassed. She said, “This is the harem; men usually cannot enter here. Although Imperial Concubine Moon has a special status that gives her the privilege to bid you enter and leave, you cannot stay here forever. Aren’t these the common rules of a palace?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That makes some sense.” Lin Ming smiled and nodded, still having no intention of leaving.
