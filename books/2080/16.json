Her mother didn\u0027t even miss her yet, didn\u0027t know she was gone. But by tomorrow she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould. Tomorrow was May first, Hannah\u0027s birthday, and Chess would give her mother the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess, of course. Hannah wished now that she\u0027d spent more time saying goodbye to Chess, that she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexplained things better. Chess would have been fascinated. And she had a right to know she was an Old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Winfield. That was strange-she\u0027d only known him a week. But he\u0027d tried to help her. And at this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoment, he knew more about Hannah Snow than anyone else in Montana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope he doesn\u0027t start smoking again if he rinds out I\u0027m dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that was probably how she would end up. Hannah had no illusions about that. She had a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweapon-but so did Maya, and Maya was much faster and stronger. She was no match for Maya under\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe best of circumstances, much less when she was weak and feverish. The best she could hope for was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto get Maya to kill her while she was still human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about the Circle Daybreak members. They were good people. She was sorry she wouldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave the chance to know them better, to help them. They were doing something important, something she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einstinctively sensed was necessary right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she thought about Thierry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027ll have to go wandering again, I guess. It\u0027s too bad. He hasn\u0027t had a very happy life. I was starting to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink I could take that sadness out of his eyes....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she heard a noise at last, she thought it might be her imagination. She held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It\u0027s footsteps. Getting closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shifted position. She had stationed herself near the mouth of the cavern; now she took a deep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreath and eased herself into a crouch. She wiped her sweaty right palm on her jeans and got a better\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrip on her stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe figured that Maya would shine the flashlight toward the pole where Hannah had been tied, then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emaybe take a few steps farther inside the cavern, trying to see what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll come out of the darkness\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind her. Jump and skewer her through the back. But I\u0027ve got to time it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath as she saw light outside the mouth of the cavern. Her greatest fear was that Maya\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuiet... quiet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light came closer. Hannah watched it, not moving. But her brain was clicking along in surprise. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t the slanted, focused beam of a flashlight. It was the more diffuse pool of light from a lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s brought another one. But that means...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya was walking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking quickly-and not pausing. She couldn\u0027t shine the light onto the pole yet. And she didn\u0027t seem\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanxious to-apparently it didn\u0027t occur to her that she needed to check on Hannah. She was that confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah cursed mentally. She\u0027s going too far-she\u0027s out of range. Get up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer plan in ruins, she flexed her knees and stood. She heard a crack in her knee joint that sounded as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eloud as a gunshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Maya didn\u0027t stop. She kept going. She was almost at the pole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs silently as she could, Hannah headed across the cavern. All Maya had to do was turn around to see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya was at the pole. She was stopping. She was looking from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow was the time. Hannah\u0027s muscles could feel how she had to stab, to throw her weight behind the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrust so that the stake went in under Maya\u0027s left shoulder blade. She knew how to do it. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t stab somebody in the back. Somebody who wasn\u0027t menacing her at the moment, who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t even know they were in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God! Don\u0027t be stupid! Do it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my Goddess! a voice echoed back in her head. You\u0027re not a killer. This isn\u0027t even self-defense!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated almost to the point of hysteria, Hannah heard herself let out a breath. It was wet. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arm drooped. Her muscles collapsed. She wasn\u0027t doing it. She couldn\u0027t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya slowly turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked both beautiful and eerie in the lantern light. She surveyed Hannah up and down, looking in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparticular at the drooping stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked at Hannah\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the strangest girl,\" she said, in what seemed to be genuine bewilderment. \"Why didn\u0027t you do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were smart enough to get yourself out and make yourself a weapon. Why didn\u0027t you have the guts to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinish it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was asking herself the same thing. Only with more expletives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am going to die now, she thought. And maybe die for good-because I don\u0027t have guts. Because I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t kill somebody I know is completely evil and completely determined to kill me. That\u0027s not ethics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s stupid. \"I suppose it\u0027s that Egyptian temple training,\" Maya was saying. \"Or maybe the life when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou were a Buddhist-do you remember that? Or maybe you\u0027re just weak.\" And a victim. I\u0027ve spent a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouple thousand years being a victim-yours. I guess I\u0027ve got my part down perfect by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well. It doesn\u0027t really matter why,\" Maya said. \"It all comes down to the same thing in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow. Let\u0027s get this over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stared at her, breathing hard, feeling like a rabbit looking at a headlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody should live as a victim. Every creature has a right to fight for its life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t seem to get her muscles to move anymore. She was just too tired. Every part of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehurt, from her throbbing head to her raw fingertips to her bruised and aching feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya was smiling, fixing her with eyes that shifted from lapis-lazuli blue to glacier green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be a good girl, now,\" she crooned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to be a good girl....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya reached for her with long arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch her!\" Thierry said from the cavern mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s head jerked sideways. She stared at the new pool of light on the other side of the cave. For\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe first few seconds she thought she was hallucinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, no. He was there. Thierry was standing there with a lantern of his own, tall and almost shimmering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith coiled tension, like a predator ready to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was that he was too far away. And Maya was too fast. In the same instant that it took\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah to make her brain believe her eyes, Maya was moving. In one swift step, she was behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah, with her hands around Hannah\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay where you are,\" she said. \"Or I\u0027ll break her little neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah knew she could do it. She could feel the iron strength in Maya\u0027s hands. Maya didn\u0027t need a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry put the lantern down and raised his empty hands. \"I\u0027m staying,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tell whoever else you\u0027ve got in that tunnel to go back. All the way back. If I see another person, I\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout turning, Thierry shouted. \"Go back to the entrance. All of you.\" Then he looked at Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah couldn\u0027t nod. Maya\u0027s grip was so tight that she could barely say, \"Yes.\" But she could look at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim, and she could see his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew, in that moment, that all her fears about him not wanting her anymore were groundless. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eloved her. She had never seen such open love and concern in anyone\u0027s face before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore, they understood each other. They didn\u0027t need any words. It was the end of misunderstandings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand mistrust. For perhaps the first time since she had been Hana of the Three Rivers, Hannah trusted him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout reservation. They were in accord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd neither of them wanted this to end with a death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Thierry took his eyes from Hannah\u0027s, it was to look at Maya and say, \"It\u0027s over, now. You have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto realize that. I\u0027ve got twenty people down here, and another twenty on the surface waiting.\" His voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecame softer and more deliberate. \"But I give you my word, you can walk out of here right now,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya. Nobody will touch you. All you have to do is let Hannah go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Together,\" Hannah said, coughing as Maya\u0027s hands tightened, cutting off her breath. She gasped and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinished, \"We go out together, Thierry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry nodded and looked at Maya. He was holding his hand out now, like someone trying to coax a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrightened child. \"Just let her go,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an unnatural sound, and it made Hannah\u0027s skin crawl. Nothing sane made a noise like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that way, I won\u0027t win,\" Maya said, almost pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t win anyway,\" Thierry said quietly. \"Even if you kill her, she\u0027ll still be alive-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I make her a vampire first,\" Maya interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Thierry was shaking his head. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" His voice was still quiet, but it was filled with the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eauthority of absolute conviction, a kind of bedrock certainty that held even Hannah mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if you kill her, she\u0027ll still be alive-here.\" He tapped his chest. \"In me. I keep her here. She\u0027s part of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme. So until you kill me, you can\u0027t really kill her. And you can\u0027t win. It\u0027s that simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Hannah\u0027s own heart was twisted with the force of her love for him. Her eyes \" were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear Maya breathing, and the sound was ragged. She thought that the pressure of Maya\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehands was infinitesimally less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could kill you both,\" Maya said at last in a grating voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry lifted his shoulders and dropped them in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egesture too sad to be a shrug. \"But how can you win when the people you hate aren\u0027t there to see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded insane-but it was true. Hannah could feel it hit Maya like a well-thrown javelin. If Maya\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t have Thierry as her prize, if she couldn\u0027t even make him suffer, what was the point? Where was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe victory?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s stop the cycle right here,\" Thierry said softly. \"Let her go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so gentle, and so reasonable, and so tired-sounding. Hannah didn\u0027t see how anyone could resist\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim. But she was still surprised at what happened next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, very slowly, the hands around her neck loosened their grip. Maya stepped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah sucked in a deep breath. She wanted to run to Thierry, but she was afraid to do anything to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunbalance the delicate stalemate in the cavern. Besides, her knees were wobbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya was moving around her, taking a step or two in front of her, facing Thierry directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved you,\" she said. There was a sound in her voice Hannah had never heard before, a quaver. \"Why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t you ever understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry shook his head. \"Because it\u0027s not true. You never loved me. You wanted me. Mostly because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou couldn\u0027t have me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence then as they stood looking at each other. Not because they understood each other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoo well for words, Hannah thought. Because they would never understand each other. They had nothing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence stretched on and on-and then Maya collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t fall down. But she might as well have. Hannah saw the life go out of her-the hope. The energy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat had kept Maya vibrant and sparkling after thousands of years. It had all come from her need to win .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . and now she knew she\u0027d lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Hannah,\" Thierry said quietly. \"Let\u0027s go.\" Then he turned to shout back into the tunnel behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim. \"Clear the way. We\u0027re all coming out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya had been standing slumped, her head down, her eyes on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr on her backpack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, as Thierry turned away, she flashed one glance at him and then moved as fast as a striking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esnake. She grabbed the black stake and held it horizontally, her arm drawn back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah recognized the posture instantly. As Hana of the Three Rivers she\u0027d seen hunters throw spears\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Game over,\" Maya whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had a fraction of a second to act-and no time to consider. All she thought was, No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her whole weight behind the thrust, she lunged at Maya. Stake first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp wooden point went in just under Maya\u0027s shoulder blade. She staggered, off balance, her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrow \" ruined. The black stake went skittering across the rough stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was off balance, too. She was falling. Maya was falling. But it all seemed to be happening in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslow motion. I\u0027ve killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no triumph in the thought. Only a sort of hushed certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the slow-motion feeling ended, she found herself the way anybody finds themself after a fall. On\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe ground and surprised. Except that Maya was underneath her, with a stake protruding from her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s first frantic thought was to get a doctor. She\u0027d never seen someone this badly hurt before- not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein this life. There was blood seeping out of Maya\u0027s back around the makeshift stake. It had gone in very\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeep, the wood piercing vampire flesh like razor-sharp steel through a human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry was beside her. Kneeling, pulling Hannah slightly away from Maya\u0027s prone form, as if she might\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill be dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah reached for him at the same time, and their hands met, intertwined. She held on tight, feeling a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erush of warmth and comfort from his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Thierry gently turned Maya onto her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHair was falling across Maya\u0027s face like a black waterfall. Her skin was chalky white and her eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewide open. But she was laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Hannah and laughed. In a thick choking voice, she gasped. \"You had guts-after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah whispered, \"Can we do anything for her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was terrible. Maya\u0027s laugh turned into a gurgle. A trickle of blood ran out of the side of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emouth. Her body jerked. Her eyes stared. And then, finally, she was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt her own breath sigh out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s dead. I killed her. I killed someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery creature has the right to fight for its life-or its loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry said softly, \"The cycle is broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he let Maya\u0027s shoulder go and her body slumped down again. She seemed smaller now, shrunken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment Hannah realized it wasn\u0027t an illusion. Maya was doing what all vampires do in the movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was falling in on herself, her tissues collapsing, muscle and flesh shriveling. The one hand Hannah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould see seemed to be wasting away and hardening at the same time. The skin became yellow and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleathery, showing the form of the tendons underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Maya was just a leather sack full of bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah swallowed and shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right? Let me look at you.\" Thierry was holding her, examining her. Then when Hannah met\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes, he looked at her long and searchingly and said with a different meaning, \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah understood. She looked at Maya and then back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not proud of it,\" she said slowly. \"But I\u0027m not sorry, either. It just-had to be done.\" She thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother moment, then said, getting out each word\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseparately, \"I refuse to be ... a victim... anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry tightened his arm around her. \"I\u0027m proud of you,\" he said. Then he added, \"Let\u0027s go. We need to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget you to a healer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked back through the narrow passageway, which was no longer dark because Thierry\u0027s people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad placed lanterns every few feet. At the end of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epassage, in the room with the vertical shaft, they had set up some sort of rope and pulley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe was there, and Nilsson, and the rest of the CIA group. So were Rashel and Quinn. The fighters,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah thought. Everyone called and laughed and patted her when she came in with Thierry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over,\" Thierry said briefly. \"She\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked at him and then at Hannah. And somehow they knew. They all cheered and patted her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain. Hannah didn\u0027t feel like Cinderella anymore; she felt like Dorothy after killing the Wicked Witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she didn\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe took her by the shoulders and said excitedly, \"Do you know what you\u0027ve done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah said, \"Yes. But I don\u0027t want to think about it any more right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until they\u0027d hauled her up the vertical shaft that it occurred to her to ask Thierry how he\u0027d found\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. She was standing on an inconspicuous hillside with no buildings or landmarks around. Maya had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epicked a very good hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of her own people sold her out,\" Thierry said. \"He got to the house about the same time I did this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevening, and he said he had information to sell. He was a werewolf who wasn\u0027t happy with how she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etreated him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA werewolf with black hair? Hannah wondered. But she was too sleepy suddenly to ask more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equestions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home, sir?\" Nilsson said, a little breathlessly because he\u0027d just come up the shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry looked at him, laughed, and started to help Hannah down the hill. \"That\u0027s right. Home, Nilsson.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-16.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM"}
