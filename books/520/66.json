{"id":44732,"no":66,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 19th June","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m educated! My diploma is in the bottom bureau drawer with my\n\u003cbr\u003e two best dresses. Commencement was as usual, with a few showers\n\u003cbr\u003e at vital moments. Thank you for your rosebuds. They were lovely. \n\u003cbr\u003e Master Jervie and Master Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left\n\u003cbr\u003e theirs in the bath tub and carried yours in the class procession.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here I am at Lock Willow for the summer--for ever maybe. The board\n\u003cbr\u003e is cheap; the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life. \n\u003cbr\u003e What more does a struggling author wish? I am mad about my book. \n\u003cbr\u003e I think of it every waking moment, and dream of it at night. All I\n\u003cbr\u003e want is peace and quiet and lots of time to work (interspersed with\n\u003cbr\u003e nourishing meals).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Master Jervie is coming up for a week or so in August, and Jimmie\n\u003cbr\u003e McBride is going to drop in sometime through the summer. \n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0027s connected with a bond house now, and goes about the country\n\u003cbr\u003e selling bonds to banks. He\u0027s going to combine the `Farmers\u0027 National\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e at the Corners and me on the same trip.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You see that Lock Willow isn\u0027t entirely lacking in society. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027d be expecting to have you come motoring through--only I know now\n\u003cbr\u003e that that is hopeless. When you wouldn\u0027t come to my commencement,\n\u003cbr\u003e I tore you from my heart and buried you for ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Abbott, A.B.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59788.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
