(3)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each of the battle team’s rest houses, including the seeded teams, more than a hundred fiery gazes landed on Crow and Xixi. Their strength had surpassed all of their expectations… especially since Crow was the fourth person that the Heavenly Bow Battle Team revealed, and they even had the six-Jeweled Yun Li as well. In this moment, no one dared to underestimate the Heavenly Bow Battle Team anymore. Clearly, it was not an ordinary team, not one that could be underestimated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most dazzling was naturally Crow. The Skills that she had shown, warping to a sun-like presence, the Control Skill, her sheer strength… even the ZhongTian Empire Skill Storing Palace Master Shangguan Longyin could not recognize those Skills. Only Zhou Weiqing could vaguely guess that those Skills might have some connection to the Gold Crow Legendary Axes. As her strength grew, it seemed like the legendary weapon of the Gold Crow Tribe was able to burst forth with even greater strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Third match. Heavenly Bow Battle Team victory.” With some difficulty, the judge finally proclaimed the results of the third match. With the corresponding metallic screeches, Crow and Xixi took great strides down the stage, returning to the rest house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Li sat to the side, not speaking any longer, swallowing hard as he looked on. Thinking back to Zhou Weiqing’s words, he could no longer retort at all. The power that Crow had shown left his heart full of shock. Examining himself, he knew that he would also be unable to take those Skills head on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire ZhongTian Central Square was now rather noisy, a hubbub of voices as everyone was still eagerly discussing the previous fight, chatting about the surprise of the Heavenly Bow Battle Team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot far from the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, the members of the Kalise Battle Team had extremely ugly expressions, even slightly panicked. That was because in the next day’s fight, they would be facing off against the Heavenly Bow Battle Team. Looking at the terrifying weapons and armour of Ma Qun, Crow and Xixi, how could they not feel a chill down their spines? The Kalise Empire and Heavenly Bow Empire had long since reached a state of mortal enemies who would kill each other without question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing gave the returning Crow and Xixi a big thumbs up, as he slowly stood up. His gaze did not focus on the stage, instead looking at the panicking Kalise Battle Team, a cold smirk crossed his lips. Next, he turned to look at the Bai Da Battle Team in their rest house, and the cold killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only when the judge on the stage announced for the members for the fourth match to ascend the stage did Zhou Weiqing withdraw his gaze. In a single leap, he landed upon the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the six members of the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, four had already fought their battles. Only Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er remained. Naturally, he was not willing to let Tian’er fight, and thus he could only fight in this fourth match. [1. Technically Crow hadn’t fought her singles battle yet, so she could still have fought. Perhaps she expended too much power in the doubles fight]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s appearance also brought some surprised voices. The reason was simple this time - he was still wearing his bamboo hat and veil as he ascended the stage. Previously, due to their armour, Ma Qun, Crow and Xixi did not wear their bamboo hats, and Yun Li also did not wear his hat. However, Zhou Weiqing did not remove his; he did not wish to be recognized too easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Geritimo Battle Team member who would fight in this fourth match also ascended the stage at the same time as Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tall, well built youth with short spiky hair, having a grave, stable bearing. The first impression Zhou Weiqing had upon seeing him was like the first time he saw Lin TianAo so many years ago. Stable, stable, profound… with a greater dignity and majesty than Lin TianAo at that time. Indeed, a strange majesty that was definitely not normal at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both sides, introduce yourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Zhou Little Fatty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth from the Geritimo Battle Team said solemnly: “Yu Yun. Are you not planning to remove that hat of yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shook his head, saying: “No need, I am too ugly, and I’m too shy to show my face to scare others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Yun’s brow furrowed slightly, but his eyes were just as calm and steady as before. “The Heavenly Bow Battle Team is far stronger than I have expected. Although we have never thought of you as enemies, but we will not allow you to stall our advance. We cannot afford to lose here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Naturally I know who your enemies are, but my target is the final championship… so, I also cannot afford to lose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Yun started momentarily, at last a hint of surprise breaking the calm in his eyes. If anyone else heard Zhou Weiqing’s words, they would only think of him as arrogant and foolish. For example, the judge who was standing by the side. However, Yu Yun had the strange feeling that this youth in front of him was not just speaking nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well, let us use our own strength to speak then.” Yu Yun said solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge glanced at Zhou Weiqing with a hint of disdain before proclaiming the start of the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike all the other previous fights, when the judge moved back, both Zhou Weiqing and Yu Yun did not choose to attack at once. Instead, they both stood there unmoving, a vastly different sight from the previous sights where they would spring into action to gain first advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, any discerning viewer could tell that the fight between them had already begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the stage, the thick reverberation of Earth Attribute Heavenly Energies rose instantly. As compared to Yuling’s previous earthen yellow, the audience could clearly see that the current stage had turned a deep yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpiritual Body of Earth! Without question, this Yu Yun in front of Zhou Weiqing was the same as Yuling, also having the Spiritual Body of Earth! Furthermore, his cultivation level was even higher than Yuling… to the point where there was a qualitative change!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven sets of Heavenly Jewels appeared around Yu Yun’s wrists, an exact match to Yuling. However, having reached the Zong Stage, his aura and presence were far stronger than Yuling’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Yu Yun’s Low Level Zong Stage cultivation level, even the youth who was the leader in the Dan Dun Battle Team rest house had his brow furrowed deeply. In the eyes of most competitors, a seven-Jeweled cultivation level was already an amazing feat, but it was nothing much to them. The greatest surprise to them was that seven-Jeweled cultivation level was accompanied with the Spiritual Body of Earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick Earth Attribute Heavenly Energy began to force all the other Attributes out of the stage area. Although Yu Yun did not attack, as Zhou Weiqing stood there he could clearly sense the Earth Attribute Heavenly Energy begin to pressure upon him crazily. H knew that as long as he made any move, then the Earth Energies with Yu Yun as the central focus point would explode forth instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are no match for me, and I do not wish to hurt you. After all, in a certain perspective, my Heavenly Bow Empire and your Geritimo Empire are on the same battle-lines, sharing the same fates.” Even being surrounded by such a thick Earth Attribute Heavenly Energy, Zhou Weiqing still spoke calmly and in a relaxed tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust because Zhou Weiqing did not attack, Yu Yun did not relax. On the contrary, this youth with the bamboo hat gave him an unbelievably deep and profound feeling, as if he was facing a vast chasm that could swallow everything. This was also the reason why he did not activate his attack at first reason. He had been confident that his cultivation level, his power, was at the top echelons of this Heavenly Jewel Tournament, yet he was still unable to penetrate the opaqueness of this youth in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you only know how to talk glibly, I will not be courteous.” Yu Yun said coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Alright then, it is true that I have to show some things before I can be taken seriously… otherwise I will not have any chance in convincing you, right?” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing’s right foot suddenly tapped lightly on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis actions instantly struck a response in Yu Yun, and a thick, deep yellow light sprang forth from the entire stage. There was no actual attack, but this purest of elemental lashes was definitely powerful, and it had myriads of changes and possibilities. No matter what Zhou Weiqing did, Yu Yun was confident he could react in timely fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, soon Yu Yun realised he was very wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing’s right foot landed on the ground, a soft thud rang out, and the deep yellow Earth Energies that had been gushing out from below his foot was actually forced out of the area. Although it was still gushing out from the earth, it could only do so around Zhou Weiqing’s body, as if forming a yellow pillar of light around him, but not actually reaching him or hurting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the column of deep yellow light appeared, a strange grey glow erupted from Zhou Weiqing’s body. It was in that instant that shock appeared on Yu Yun’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, it was in the depths of his soul that he had sensed such a thing, but it had become truth. Zhou Weiqing’s body seemed to actually turn into a massive chasm, and the Earth energies that he had activated using his Spiritual Body of Earth was swarming into Zhou Weiqing’s body crazily, as if being thrown into a bottomless pit, vanishing as they did so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the single stomp of his foot, Zhou Weiqing did not make any other move. However, all that was left in Yu Yun’s eyes was pure unadulterated shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never met such a circumstance, even against opponents far stronger than he was he would at least still have some confidence in fighting to the end. However, in meeting such a strange situation, he couldn’t find the confidence within himself to continue holding out anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What thick and powerful earth energies, truly lives up to the name of Spiritual Body of Earth.” Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing was still able to speak in such a relaxed tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Yun’s forehead was already beading with sweat. Although he was able to use his Spiritual Body of Earth to activate the earthen energies, it still took his own Heavenly Energy to do so. Furthermore, as the large amount of Earth energies was being Devoured non-stop by Zhou Weiqing, his own Heavenly Energy was also being drained constantly. Facing Zhou Weiqing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing might seemed relaxed and having it easy, but in truth, this battle was one that he had racked his brains and painstakingly arranged so. He did not wish to reveal his identity too early. Facing a seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master with the Spiritual Body of Earth, if it were an ordinary fight, even for him it would be extremely tough, even if he was confident of winning in the end. However, in doing so, it would definitely reveal his own identity. After all, Shen Little Demon was very familiar with some of his powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, Zhou Weiqing had used a single drop of Saint Energy, and this time it was infused into his Demonic Attribute Devour Skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind his bamboo hat and veil, Zhou Weiqing’s face was smiling. The only thing in his mind now was… \u003ci\u003eI’m earning big now!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spiritual Body of Earth was indeed domineering, and the earth energies it was able to wield was unbelievably pure. As Zhou Weiqing Devoured the energies, in just a short period of time, he had already formed two drops of Saint Energy! Not only had he recouped his losses, he had even earned a drop! As such, he was not in any rush at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Yun gritted his teeth with all his strength, taking a swift step towards Zhou Weiqing in a short charge. The thick Earth Attribute Heavenly Energy around him causing his entire body to bulge up, turning into a massive stone giant as he sent a fist careening towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-216-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-217-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-216-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
