Built as a gambling club in the eighteenth century, White\u0027s was one of the oldest clubs in England, and the most exclusive. Members put their sons\u0027 names in for membership at birth, for there was a thirty-year waiting list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe facade of White\u0027s was the epitome of discretion. The wide bow windows looking out on St. James\u0027s Street were meant to accommodate those within rather than to satisfy the curiosity of the outsiders passing by. A short flight of steps led to the entrance but, aside from members and their guests, few people ever got past the door. The rooms in the club were large and impressive, burnished with the dark rich patina of time. The furniture was old and comfortable - leather couches, newspaper racks, priceless antique tables and deep stuffed armchairs that had held the posteriors of half a dozen Prime Ministers. There was a backgammon room with a large, open fireplace behind a bronze-covered rail, and a formal curved staircase led to the dining room upstairs. The dining room ran across the entire breadth of the house, and contained one huge mahogany table which seated thirty persons, and five side tables. At any luncheon or dinner the room contained some of the most influential men in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Alec Nichols, Member of Parliament, was seated at one of the small corner tables, having lunch with a guest, Jon Swinton. Sir Alec\u0027s father had been a baronet, and his father and grandfather before him. They had all belonged to White\u0027s. Sir Alec was a thin, pale man in his late forties, with a sensitive, aristocratic face and an engaging smile. He had just motored in from his country estate in Gloucestershire, and was dressed in a tweed sports jacket and slacks, with loafers. His guest wore a pinstripe suit with a loud checked shirt and a red tie, and seemed out of place in this quiet, rich atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They really do you proud here,\" Jon Swinton said, his mouth full, as he chewed the remains of a large veal chop on his plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Alec nodded. \"Yes. Things have changed since Voltaire said, \u0027The British have a hundred religions and only one sauce.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon Swinton looked up. \"Who\u0027s Voltaire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Alec said, embarrassed, \"A - a French chap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Jon Swinton washed his food down with a swallow of wine. He laid down his knife and fork and wiped a napkin across his mouth. \"Well, now, Sir Alec. Time for you and I to talk a little business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec Nichols said softly, \"I told you two weeks ago I\u0027m working everything out, Mr. Swinton. I need a bit more time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waiter walked over to the table, balancing a high stack of wooden cigar boxes. He skillfully set them down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mind if I do,\" Jon Swinton said. He examined the labels on the boxes, whistled in admiration, pulled out several cigars which he put in his breast pocket, then lit one. Neither the waiter nor Sir Alec showed any reaction to this breach of manners. The waiter nodded to Sir Alec, and carried the cigars to another table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My employers have been very lenient with you, Sir Alec. Now, I\u0027m afraid, they\u0027ve got impatient.\" He picked up the burned match, leaned forward and dropped it into Sir Alec\u0027s glass of wine. \"Between you and I, they\u0027re not nice people when they\u0027re upset. You don\u0027t want to get them down on you, you know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I simply don\u0027t have the money right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon Swinton laughed loudly. \"Come off it, chum. Your mom was a Roffe, right? You got a hundred-acre farm, a posh town house in Knightsbridge, a Rolls-Royce and a bloody Bentley. You\u0027re not exactly on the dole then, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Alec looked around, pained, and said quietly, \"None of them is a liquid asset. I can\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton winked and said, \"I\u0027ll bet that sweet little wife of yours, Vivian, is a liquid asset, eh? She\u0027s got a great pair of Bristols.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Alec flushed. Vivian\u0027s name on this man\u0027s lips was a sacrilege. Alec thought of Vivian as he had left her that morning, still sweetly asleep. They had separate bedrooms, and one of Alec Nichols\u0027 great joys was to go into Vivian\u0027s room for one of his \"visits.\" Sometimes, when Alec awakened early, he would walk into Vivian\u0027s bedroom while she was asleep and simply stare at her. Awake or asleep, she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. She slept in the nude, and her soft, curved body would be half exposed as she curled into the sheets. She was blond, with wide, pale-blue eyes and skin like cream. Vivian had been a minor actress when Sir Alec had first met her at a charity ball. He had been enchanted by her looks, but what had drawn him to her was her easy, outgoing personality. She was twenty years younger than Alec, and filled with a zest for living. Where Alec was shy and introverted, Vivian was gregarious and vivacious. Alec had been unable to get her out of his mind, but it had taken him two weeks to summon up nerve enough to telephone her. To his surprise and delight Vivian had accepted his invitation. Alec had taken her to a play at the Old Vic, and then to dinner at the Mirabelle. Vivian lived in a dreary little basement flat in Notting Hill, and when Alec had brought her home, she had said, \"Would you like to come in then?\" He had stayed the night, and it had changed his whole life. It was the first time that any woman had been able to bring him to a climax. He had never experienced anything like Vivian. She was velvet tongue and trailing golden hair and moist pulsing demanding depths that Alec explored until he was drained. He could become aroused simply thinking about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something else. She made him laugh, she made him come alive. She poked fun at Alec because he was shy and a bit stodgy, and he adored it. He was with her as often as Vivian would permit it. When Alec took Vivian to a party, she was always the center of attention. Alec was proud of that, but jealous of the young men gathered around her, and he could not help wondering how many of them she had been to bed with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the nights when Vivian could not see him because she had another engagement, Alec was frantic with jealousy. He would drive to her flat and park down the block to see what time she came home, and whom she was with. Alec knew that he was behaving like a fool, and yet he could not help himself. He was in the grip of something too strong to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized that Vivian was wrong for him, that it was out of the question for him to marry her. He was a baronet, a respected Member of Parliament, with a brilliant future. He was part of the Roffe dynasty, on the board of directors of the company. Vivian had no background to help her cope with Alec\u0027s world. Her mother and father had been second-rate music-hall artists, playing the provincial circuit. Vivian had had no education except for what she had picked up in the streets, or backstage. Alec knew that she was promiscuous and superficial. She was shrewd but not particularly intelligent. And yet Alec was obsessed with her. He fought it. He tried to stop seeing her, but it was no use. He was happy when he was with her, and he was miserable when he was without her. In the end he proposed to her because he had to, and when Vivian accepted, Sir Alec Nichols was ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis new bride moved into the family house, a beautiful old Robert Adam house in Gloucestershire, a Georgian mansion with Delphic columns and a long sweeping driveway. It was set amid the green of a hundred acres of lush farmland, with its own private hunting, and running streams to fish. At the back of the house was a park that had been laid out by \"Capability\" Brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of the house was stunning. The large front hall had a stone floor and walls of painted wood. There were pairs of old lanterns and marble-topped Adam giltwood tables and mahogany chairs. The library had original eighteenth-century built-in bookcases, and a pair of pedestal tables by Henry Holland, and chairs designed by Thomas Hope. The drawing room was a mixture of Hepplewhite and Chippendale, with a Wilton carpet, and a pair of Waterford glass chandeliers. There was a huge dining room that would seat forty guests, and a smoking room. On the second floor were six bedrooms, each with an Adam fireplace, and on the third floor were the servants\u0027 quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix weeks after she had moved into the house, Vivian said, \"Let\u0027s get out of this place, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, puzzled. \"You mean you\u0027d like to go up to London for a few days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean I want to move back to London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec looked out the window at the emerald-green meadows, where he had played as a child, and at the giant sycamore and oak trees, and he said hesitantly, \"Vivian, it\u0027s so peaceful here. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she said, \"I know, luv. That\u0027s what I can\u0027t stand - the fucking peace!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved to London the following week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had an elegant four-story town house in Wilton Crescent, off Knightsbridge, with a lovely drawing room, a study, a large dining room, and at the back of the house, a picture window that overlooked a grotto, with a waterfall and statues and white benches set amid a beautiful formal garden. Upstairs were a magnificent master suite and four smaller bedrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivian and Alec shared the master suite for two weeks, until one morning Vivian said, \"I love you, Alec, but you do snore, you know.\" Alec had not known. \"I really must sleep alone, luv. You don\u0027t mind, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec minded deeply. He loved the feel of her soft body in bed, warm against him. But deep inside, Alec knew that he did not excite Vivian sexually the way other men excited her. That was why she did not want him in her bed. So now he said, \"Of course I understand, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Alec\u0027s insistence, Vivian kept the master suite, and he moved into one of the small guest bedrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, Vivian had gone to the House of Commons and sat in the Visitors\u0027 Gallery on days when Alec was to speak. He would look up at her and be filled with a deep, ineffable pride. She was undoubtedly the most beautiful woman there. And then came the day when Alec finished his speech and looked up for Vivian\u0027s approval, and saw only an empty seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec blamed himself for the fact that Vivian was restless. His friends were older than Vivian, too conservative for her. He encouraged her to invite her young companions to the house, and brought them together with his friends. The results were disastrous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec kept telling himself that when Vivian had a child, she would settle down and change. But one day, somehow - and Alec could not bear to know how - she picked up a vaginal infection and had to have a hysterectomy. Alec had longed for a son. The news had shattered him, but Vivian was unperturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, luv,\" she said, smiling. \"They took out the nursery, but they left in the playpen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her for a long moment, then turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivian loved to go on buying sprees. She spent money mdiscriminately, recklessly, on clothes and jewelry and cars, and Alec did not have the heart to stop her. He told himself that she had grown up in poverty, hungry for beautiful things. He wanted to buy them for her. Unfortunately, he could not afford it. His salary was consumed by taxes. His fortune lay in his shares of stock in Roffe and Sons but those shares were restricted. He tried to explain that to Vivian but she was not interested. Business discussions bored her. And so Alec let her carry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had first learned of her gambling when Tod Michaels, the owner of Tod\u0027s Club, a disreputable gambling place in Soho, had dropped in to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have your wife\u0027s IOU\u0027s here for a thousand pounds, Sir Alec. She had a rotten run at roulette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had been shocked. He had paid off the IOU\u0027s and had had a confrontation with Vivian that evening. \"We simply can\u0027t afford it,\" he had told her. \"You\u0027re spending more than I\u0027m making.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been very contrite. \"I\u0027m sorry, angel. Baby\u0027s been bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had walked over to him and put her arms around him and pressed her body against his, and he had forgotten his anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had spent a memorable night in her bed. He was sure now that there would be no more problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks later Tod Michaels had come to visit Alec again. This time Vivian\u0027s IOU\u0027s were five thousand pounds. Alec was furious. \"Why did you let her have credit?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s your wife, Sir Alec,\" Michaels had replied blandly. \"How would it look if we refused her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll - I\u0027ll have to get the money,\" Alec had said. \"I don\u0027t have that much cash at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please! Consider it a loan. Pay it back when you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had been greatly relieved. \"That\u0027s very generous of you, Mr. Michaels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not until a month later that Alec learned that Vivian had gambled away another twenty-five thousand pounds, and that Alec was being charged interest at the rate of 10 percent a week. He was horrified. There was no way he could raise that much cash. There was nothing that he could even sell. The houses, the beautiful antiques, the cars, all belonged to Roffe and Sons. His anger frightened Vivian enough so that she promised not to gamble anymore. But it was too late. Alec found himself in the hands of loan sharks. No matter how much Alec gave them, he could not manage to pay off the debt. It kept mounting each month, instead of getting smaller, and it had been going on for almost a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tod Michaels\u0027 hoodlums first began to press him for the money, Alec had threatened to go to the police commissioner. \"I have connections in the highest quarters,\" Alec had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man had grinned. \"I got connections in the lowest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Sir Alec found himself sitting here at White\u0027s with this dreadful man, having to contain his pride, and beg for a little more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already paid them back more than the money I borrowed. They can\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton replied, \"That was just on the interest, Sir Alec. You still haven\u0027t paid the principal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s extortion,\" Alec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton\u0027s eyes darkened. \"I\u0027ll give the boss your message.\" He started to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec said quickly, \"No! Sit down. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Swinton sat down again. \"Don\u0027t use words like that,\" he warned. \"The last chap who talked like that had both his knees nailed to the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had read about it. The Kray brothers had invented the punishment for their victims. And the people Alec was dealing with were just as bad, just as ruthless. He could feel the bile rising in his throat. \"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" Alec said. \"It\u0027s just that I - I don\u0027t have any more cash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton flicked the ash from his cigar into Alec\u0027s glass of wine, and said, \"You have a big bundle of stock in Roffe and Sons, don\u0027t you, Alec baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Alec replied, \"but it\u0027s nonsalable and nontransferable. It\u0027s no good to anyone unless Roffe and Sons goes public.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton took a puff on his cigar. \"And is it going public?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s up to Sam Roffe. I\u0027ve - I\u0027ve been trying to persuade him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Mr. Michaels he\u0027ll get his money,\" Alec said. \"But please stop hounding me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton stared. \"Hounding you? Why, Sir Alec, you little cocksucker, you\u0027ll know when we start hounding you. Your fucking stables will burn down, and you\u0027ll be eating roast horsemeat. Then your house will burn. And maybe your wife.\" He smiled, and Alec wished he had not. \"Have you ever eaten cooked pussy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had turned pale. \"For God\u0027s sake - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinton said soothingly, \"I\u0027m kidding. Tod Michaels\u0027 your friend. And friends help each other, right? We were talking about you at our meeting this morning. And do you know what the boss said? He said, \u0027Sir Alec\u0027s a good sort. If he hasn\u0027t got the money, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll think of some other way to take care of us.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec frowned. \"What other way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now, it\u0027s not all that hard for a bright chap like you to work out, is it? You\u0027re running a big drug company, right? You make things like cocaine, for example. Just between you and I, who\u0027d ever know if you happened to accidentally misplace a few shipments here and there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec stared at him. \"You\u0027re insane,\" he said. \"I - I couldn\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s amazing what people can do when they have to,\" Swinton said genially. He rose to his feet. \"You either have our money for us, or we\u0027ll tell you where to deliver the merchandise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ground his cigar out in Alec\u0027s butter plate. \"Give my regards to Vivian, Sir Alec. Ta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jon Swinton was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Alec sat there alone, unseeing, surrounded by all the familiar, comfortable things that were so much a part of his past life, that were now threatened. The only alien thing was the obscene wet cigar butt in the plate. How had he ever allowed them to come into his life? He had permitted himself to be maneuvered into a position where he was in the hands of the underworld. And now he knew that they wanted more than money from him. The money was merely the bait with which they had trapped him. They were after his connections with the drug company. They were going to try to force him to work with them. If it became known he was in their power, the Opposition would not hesitate to make capital of it. His own party would probably ask him to resign. It would be done tactfully and quietly. They would probably exert pressure on him to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds, a post that paid a nominal salary of a hundred pounds a year from the Crown. The one barrier to being an M.P. was that you could not be in receipt of pay from the Crown or the Government. So Alec would no longer be allowed to serve in Parliament. The reason could not be kept secret, of course. He would be in disgrace. Unless he could come up with a large sum of money. He had talked to Sam Roffe again and again, asking him to let the company go public, to let the shares of stock be marketed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it,\" Sam had told him. \"The minute we let outsiders in, we have a lot of strangers telling us how to run our business. Before you know it, they\u0027ll take over the board, and then the company. What\u0027s the difference to you, Alec? You have a big salary, an unlimited expense account. You don\u0027t need the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Alec had been tempted to tell Sam how desperately he needed it. But he knew it would do no good. Sam Roffe was a company man, a man without compassion. If he knew that Alec had in any way compromised Roffe and Sons, he would have dismissed him without a moment\u0027s hesitation. No, Sam Roffe was the last person to whom he could turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec was facing ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reception porter at White\u0027s walked toward Sir Alec\u0027s table with a man dressed in a messenger\u0027s uniform, carrying a sealed manila envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Sir Alec,\" the porter apologized, \"but this man insists that he has instructions to deliver something to you personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Sir Alec said. The messenger handed him the envelope, and the porter led him back to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec sat there a long time before he reached for the envelope and opened it. He read the message through three times, then he slowly crumpled the paper in his fist, and his eyes began to fill with tears. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-5.html","bookId":2356,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:12 AM"}
