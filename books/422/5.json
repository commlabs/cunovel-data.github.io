How Siegfried warred against the Saxons","content":"\u0026nbsp;Then came to the land of Gunther tidings strange and dread; \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For out of a far, far country were heralds to Burgundy sped\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a tale of unknown warriors and the hate they bare to the king;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in passing great disquiet the brethren heard that thing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now these were they that had sent them:—the lord of the Saxon land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n King Lüdiger mighty in war-hosts, mighty in strength of hand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Lüdegast for his helper, the lord of the land of the Dane;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And warriors marched unnumbered ’neath the banners of these twain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they came to the land of Gunther, those bearers of threats of war,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even they whom his adversaries had sent forth from afar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And men looked on the unknown faces, and asked, “What tale do ye bring?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they led the heralds of war-storm to the presence of the King.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he gave to them courteous greeting: “Welcome to me be ye.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What man hath sent you hither not yet hath been told unto me:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Speak out and utter your message,” said the noble king war-wise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then sank their hearts, as they looked on the flame in Gunther’s eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If thou, O King, wilt suffer that we speak”—the heralds replied—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Unhindered all our message, no word from thee will we hide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So name we to you the princes who have laid on us this command:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, Lüdegast hitherward marcheth with Lüdiger unto your land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye twain have provoked their anger: in our ears was spoken the word,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How that ye in the hearts of our liege-lords deadliest hate have stirred;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they purpose to lead their battles unto Worms beside the Rhine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n See ye that your war-thanes help you! Lo, this is the warning-sign.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Within twelve weeks shall the thunder of the tramp of their hosts draw near.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If then ye have loyal vassals, let their fealty now appear:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let them ward the peace of the castle, let them keep unharried the field.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, here shall be fearful hewing of many a helm and shield!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 21}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or if haply for peace ye will pray them, now let us be certified,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or ever their ranks of battle across your marches ride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or ever your strong foes bow you in bitterness of soul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, many a champion shall perish when hither the war-waves roll!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ye shall tarry a little season—my mind shall ye know ere long—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While I ponder upon this matter,” spake Gunther the valiant and strong.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “O yea, I have loyal vassals; to them will I bear this word,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the tale of your war-defiance shall of all my friends be heard.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of a truth unto Gunther the mighty full heavy the tidings were,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his innermost heart was burdened by the message that it bare;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he bade to his presence Hagen and other his liegemen withal,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he sent to summon Gernot in haste to his council-hall:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So gathered his best, all vassals unto whom came that command;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake: “Lo, our foes be minded to march into Burgundy-land\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a mighty array—ye may well be indignation-stung\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the unprovoked defiance that these in our faces have flung!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “From these shall our swords defend us!” Prince Gernot’s voice rang high.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Men must die in the day of their dooming: in death e’en let them lie!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will never forget mine honour for dread of what may befall!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We will welcome our adversaries to the War-god’s festival!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then answered Hagen of Troneg: “O’er-hasty, I trow, are thy words;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the kings of the Danes and the Saxons be exceeding arrogant lords;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so few days cannot suffice us for our war-host’s mustering.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It were good,” said the valiant warrior, “that we told unto Siegfried the thing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they gave those war-denouncers for dwellings their city’s best,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How hateful they were soever, for such was the knightly hest\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of Gunther the noble-hearted—since thus fair honour bade—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till the friends should be known who would fail not to bring their battle-aid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the King in his heart was bearing a burden of sorrow and fear;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the hero, the swift war-helper, beheld him heavy of cheer,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he marvelled thereat, for he knew not why he went ’neath a load of care.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake, and he prayed King Gunther the cause thereof to declare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 22}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Exceeding sorely I marvel,” the hero Siegfried said,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wherefore thine olden joyance this day is utterly fled,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The gracious cheer that aforetime made the hearts that love thee light.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered and spake to him Gunther, that royal-goodly knight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In sooth may I suffer not all men in my sorrow of soul to have part:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I must keep my grief deep-hidden, I must bear it alone in mine heart:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto tried friends only and steadfast may a man unveil his pain.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then pale grew the face of Siegfried, and anon waxed crimson again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He spake to the King, and he answered: “Have I ever denied thee aught?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will help thee to cast the burden of thy spirit sorrow-fraught.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If ye seek for friends true-hearted, lo, such an one even am I:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will cleave unto thee and aid thee in honour till I die.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now God requite thee, Siegfried, for thy words as music ring!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, though thy might and thy valour no help unto me could bring,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even so should thy love’s assurance make glad mine heart this day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If I live on yet for a season, of a surety I will repay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thou therefore shalt hear the trouble wherewith mine heart is stirred:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mine adversaries’ heralds have brought unto me this word,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That their kings be marching to seek us here with their war-array;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such outrage never warriors have dealt to us unto this day!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let this not disquiet thy spirit,” spake the hero in answer thereto;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Speak peace to thine heart, and according to this my counsel do:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suffer me, even me, to win thee honour and goodly gain\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or ever thy foes to the marches of this thy land attain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, had those thy mighty foemen of battle-helpers arrayed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So many as thrice ten thousand, by me should their onset be stayed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had I at my side but a thousand. Commit thy cause unto me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake unto him King Gunther: “I am bounden for ever to thee!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Give charge that a thousand riders shall follow me forth to the fray,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Inasmuch as of mine own warriors no more can I set in array\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here, than my twelve war-fellows: so will I ward your land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And loyal service ever shall be done you by Siegfried’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 23}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea also let Hagen help us, and Ortwein fare to the fight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dankwart and Sindold, each man a well-belovèd knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therewithal shall ride in our war-host Volker the aweless one,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he shall be banner-bearer: better than he is none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And let those war-denouncers to their own lords’ land ride back,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And cause them to bear this message, that we follow hard on their track:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So safe shall our castles be warded, and their peace no foe shall mar.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the king bade summon the muster of his friends and his men of war.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So back to their lord went the bearers of Lüdiger’s command:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were well content to be faring thence to their own home-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Gunther the royal-hearted rich gifts on the men bestowed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And therewithal safe-conduct; and with blithe hearts thence they rode.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say ye to my mighty foemen,” thus spake Burgundia’s Lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Better for them unventured were their journey hitherward.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Howbeit, if here in mine own land to seek my face they be fain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So my battle-helpers fail not, they shall find their bitter bane.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then goodly gifts to the heralds his treasure-warders bare;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Good sooth, of the same had Gunther enow and withal to spare!—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Neither dared they refuse them, the bearers of Lüdiger’s command.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So took they their leave, and they journeyed with glad hearts forth of the land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So then when the heralds to Denmark from Burgundy had passed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And had spoken the tidings unlooked-for to their lord, King Lüdegast,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had told him the word of the dwellers by Rhine, that message grim,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For that haughty-hearted defiance was the soul made bitter in him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For they told him of many a valiant knight in the King’s war-band:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yea, one we beheld with Gunther, and he stood at the king’s right hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Siegfried they named him, a hero of Netherland.” Thus spake they.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Lüdegast’s heart at the tidings was filled with strange dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So then when the tale of their message was heard all Denmark o’er,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They hasted to win war-helpers, yea, more than theretofore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till their lord, King Lüdegast, under his banner beheld enrolled\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Warriors twice ten thousand, all war-thanes dauntless-souled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 24}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Lüdiger, lord of the Saxons, gathered his war-array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till his battle-muster was two-score thousand, yea, more than they,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who should join them with Denmark’s war-host, unto Burgundy to ride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But in that land also had Gunther the King sent far and wide;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To his kinsmen-friends and the war-host of his brethren he sent his hest\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the end they should follow his banner as battleward he pressed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with these came the knights of Hagen: yea, sore was their need that day;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the shadow of death already over many a warrior lay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They addressed them unto their journey; for nought was their march delayed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Volker was banner-bearer, Volker the unafraid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the day that they went forth riding from Worms by the waters of Rhine;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Hagen of Troneg marshalled Burgundia’s battle-line.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There in the ranks rode Sindold and Hunold the dauntless-souled,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such warriors as earn rich guerdon when war-kings lavish their gold;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rode Dankwart the brother of Hagen, and with these was Ortwein found.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they marched on the path of honour, they marched to be glory-crowned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lord King,” spake Siegfried, “I pray thee, at home do thou abide,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While the good knights after my banner forth to the battle shall ride;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stay thou, that the hearts of the weak ones may be strong in thy fearlessness;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And I will guard thine honour and thy wealth in the battle’s stress.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they that were fain to seek thee at Worms by the waters of Rhine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With them will I take such order, that nought shall they harm that is thine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, we into their own homeland so far will ride in our raid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That soon shall the overweening be with sorrow sore dismayed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From Rhine through the land of Hesse rode on that hero-host,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And over the Saxon marches, where the fight should be won and lost;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they drave the spoil, and they harried with flame the land of the foe:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, bitter straits and anguish did the robber war-kings know!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they came to the Saxon marches, and the vanguard pressed on still.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Siegfried the mighty champion asked of the chieftains’ will:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Whom now shall we make our warder of camp and of sumpter-train?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Ha, never of war-raid the Saxons suffered deadlier bane!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 25}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they said, “Let the henchmen that follow the wielders of spear and brand\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Be warded of Dankwart the valiant, of the swift death-dealing hand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So shall our loss be the lesser from Lüdiger’s plundering horde.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, leave with him Ortwein: our rear-guard shall these twain safely

out their array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Until I shall know of a surety where now their warriors are.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with speed fair Siegelind’s scion stood sheathed in his harness of war.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the host he committed to Hagen, or ever he rode on the quest,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even to him and to Gernot, the knight of the dauntless breast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So into the land of the Saxons rode he forward alone—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, to fashion a tale for the minstrels, a tale of glory won!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spied he onward-surging o’er the plain a host of war,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So huge that Burgundia’s warriors by these were outnumbered far;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For their tale was two-score thousand, yea, more than this, I trow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then leapt his heart and lightened his eyes with the battle-glow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now afront of the host of the foemen there rode a goodly knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To watch for a battle-token, in shining harness dight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Siegfried the hero beheld him, and on him that champion gazed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the eyes of each upon other with the fury of battle blazed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now who was the keen war-eagle that on watching pinions hung?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A gleaming shield all-golden from his leftward shoulder was slung.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n King Lüdegast was the warrior that thus o’er the host kept ward.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, the noble stranger-hero against him is spurring hard!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the wrath of the lord of the Danefolk by the battle-challenge is stirred,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the mighty steeds to the onset are racing fierily spurred.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In their strong grip over the shield-rims they couched their lances low—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, but the proud king knew not that he rode to his shame and his woe!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The war-steeds hearkened the spur-sting, and swift as arrows they leapt,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the kings clashed like unto breakers by a tempest-blast on-swept;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And knightly they wheeled to the onset their reeling steeds with the rein,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with swords they essayed the decision of strife, that terrible twain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 26}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At each stroke of the hero Siegfried far round the whole plain rung,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the helmet was flashing and flaming as with fire from a torch outflung;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even so were the red sparks leaping ’neath the sword in the hero’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lions both were the Dane-king and the Lord of the Nether Land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For with many a furious sword-stroke did the king of the Daneland smite;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, this one and that at the bucklers hewed with his uttermost might.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now their strife was beheld of thirty knights of the king’s war-band:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But or ever these might reach him victor did Siegfried stand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For with three wide-gaping gashes he made that war-king reel;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They sundered the shining harness, the welded links of steel;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the great sword’s cleaving lightning swift followed the rain of blood;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then groaned the king of the Danefolk in bitterness of mood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For his life must he make supplication: “I will pay for my ransoming,”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He cried, “the land of Denmark! I am Lüdegast the king!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But by this full nigh were his war-band, the knights that from far had seen\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Betwixt these two fore-scouters what deadly strife had been.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Siegfried would lead the vanquished away; but they fell forthright\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upon him, those thirty warriors, yet his hand by its single might\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aye guarded his princely captive with strokes that fell like hail;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And soon to that king’s defenders had he dealt yet deadlier bale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For he smote, that captive-warder, the thirty, till dead they lay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Save one that turned his horse-rein, and swiftly fled away,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And bare the bitter tidings of all to the host of the Danes,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his shattered helmet witnessed thereto with its bloody stains.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then were the knights of Daneland shame-stricken and bitter-souled,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the tale how their king was a captive that day in their ears was told.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they bare to his brother the tidings, and the storm of his wrath outbrake\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In madness of fury and anguish for his captive brother’s sake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now by this had the king of the Danefolk been led from the field of fight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Back to the host of Gunther by Siegfried’s resistless might;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to Hagen’s hand did he give him: glad were his friends for the word\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the King of the land of Denmark was the spoil of Siegfried’s sword!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 27}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then they cried through the host, “To the spear-staves bind ye the banners on!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Forward!” rang Siegfried’s war-cry: “great deeds this day shall be done\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere the evenfall, if my sinews fail not, if I lose not life!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This day through the land of the Saxons shall be rued by many a wife!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Heroes of Rhineland, whither I press before, take heed!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the heart of Lüdiger’s war-host cleaving your path will I lead:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye shall see brave hewing of helmets by many a hero’s hand!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere back from the battle we turn us, shall sorrow o’ercloud this land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now on their steeds have Gernot and the men of his war-band sprung;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the grasp of the warrior-minstrel is the battle-flag upflung;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Volker is bearing the banner afront of them all to the fray:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, the very hearts of the camp-folk leap to the onset to-day!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the host that they led to the war-shock in no more than a thousand was told,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Save for those twelve knights of Siegfried.

upon litters be borne: so led they away,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Captives unto the Rhine-flood, five hundred men from the fray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All empty-handed of triumph home rode each Danish knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nor yet had the Saxons borne them so stoutly in that fight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That their people should sing their praises: in sorrow and shame went they\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mid wailing for dear ones fallen in the slaughter of that day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now their needless armour Rhineward the sumpter-beasts might bear,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For Siegfried the strong and his helpers had rid the land of the fear\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of foes from border to border: so had he accomplished this\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That all King Gunther’s war-host must acclaim the deed for his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Straightway to Worms Prince Gernot hasted the messengers’ feet\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To bear unto friends in the homeland the tidings passing sweet,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That tale of the might triumphant of the Kings and their war-array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tale of the deeds of the valiant, of the dawn of glory’s day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fast, fast those victory-heralds sped, and the tale was told.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How leap their hearts for gladness that of late were sorrowful-souled,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For all those joyful tidings through the jubilant land that ring!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How instant are high-born ladies with eager questioning\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How had it fared with their dear lords in the King’s war-host who fought!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, into the presence of Kriemhild was a messenger straightway brought:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet the thing was done as in secret, and she would not that folk should know,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the Hero’s sake in whose keeping was her heart from long ago.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When stood that victory-bringer in her bower before her eyes,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kriemhild the lovely bespake him in exceeding gracious wise:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 31}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now tell me thy joyful tidings, and my gold shall thy guerdon be;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And, so nought of the truth be hidden, thou hast ever a friend in me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tell how hath my brother Gernot come forth of the battle-strife,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And other my friends and kinsmen. Be there many that lost their life?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who in that day triumphant was in prowess chief?—say on!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake the messenger true-hearted: “Sooth, battle-blencher was none;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But in that stern warrior-onset no champion rode so well,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O noble Daughter

of battle-prowess that were wrought by Siegfried’s hand!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What deeds soever the champions achieved in the battle-play,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even Dankwart and Hagen, and other of Gunther’s war-array—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their glory, their prowess, were even as an idle wind should sing,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Set by the deeds of Siegfried, the son of Siegmund the King.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O yea, in the storm of battle full many a hero they slew:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But whoso essayed could never tell all the marvels through\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That were wrought by the arm of Siegfried as he rode the surges of fight—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, many a lady for dear ones slain shall bewail his might!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Went down before his onset the beloved of many a bride;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His giant strokes on the helmets o’er the field rang far and wide,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And forth of the gaping gashes the blood flowed fast and free:—\n\u003c/div\u003e

slain:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thy brother withal to the foemen dealt the deadliest bane\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That ever in battle-tempest hath any champion

Burgundians found,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That shame shall touch them never: for aye are they glory-crowned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For they smote, and they saw before them many a riderless selle:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O’er the echoing field their war-glaives rang many a foeman’s knell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 32}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O yea, the knights of Rhineland rode through that stormy day\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In such wise that their foes repent them that ever they dared the fray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the valiant brethren of Troneg withal dealt deadly bane\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the war-hosts clashed, when the nations wrestled with desperate strain:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So many were then hurled earthward by dauntless Hagen’s hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thereof might a goodly story be told in Burgundia-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sindold withal and Hunold, ’neath Gernot’s banner who warred,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These wrought such deeds of prowess, with Rumold the dauntless lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That Lüdiger, king of the Saxons, to his latest hour shall repent\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The folly of that war-challenge to the Lords of Rhineland sent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet of all the mightiest war-deeds that ever on earth have been,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the least even unto the greatest that ever eye hath seen,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never were such as Siegfried hath wrought with resistless hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he bringeth royal

self-sought evils hath Lüdegast bitterly rued,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Lüdiger his brother, the lord of the Saxons, withal!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O noble Daughter of Princes, not yet have I told thee all;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For behold, these twain were captive taken by Siegfried’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never so many war-thralls have come into this our land\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As now his valour haleth hitherward unto the Rhine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —More welcome words had she hearkened never, ye well may divine—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Five hundred barons unwounded, nay more, be hitherward led,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O Queen, and of men sore

the more part smitten by dauntless Siegfried’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They whose pride overweening challenged the Lords of Rhine to the war\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now captives of King Gunther by sore constraint they are.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With joy to thy land that goodly prey do our warriors hale.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then flushed into rose the lily at the telling of that tale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, over her lovely visage for rapture the roses burned\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That out of the imminent peril alive and whole had returned\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 33}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her knight, her winsome Siegfried, of the young, heart-conquering eyes—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, she rejoiced for her kinsfolk withal in sisterly wise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Queen of Beauty: “Glad tidings to me hast thou brought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will give thee for thy guerdon bright raiment richly wrought;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And my treasurer shall count thee withal ten marks of gold.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He is happy of whom such tidings unto noble dames be told!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They gave him for his guerdon the gold and the costly array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Many a lovely maiden from her casement leaned that day,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And gazed o’er the city highway, and saw go riding by\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Many a thane high-hearted of the land of Burgundy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n First rode the knights unwounded, then the train of the stricken came,—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well might these hearken the greeting of friends with nought of shame!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the King rode forth glad-hearted to meet them, kinsman and guest:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From all his care in rejoicing his soul had gotten rest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then greeted he well his kinsfolk, and hailed each stranger knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As for kings of men so mighty is ever meet and right\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With thanks and with lovingkindness to meet men faring back\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From plucking the flower of glory from the field of the battle-wrack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now touching his friends and his kinsmen King Gunther questioneth,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even who in the highways of battle had been stricken unto death:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And behold, in heroes fourscore the tale of their slain is told!—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the brave dead none bewaileth, and so hath it been from of old.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, even the knights unwounded brought many a sword-hacked shield,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And many a rifted helmet, home from that stricken field.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the riders sprang from their horses at the gates of the hall of the King;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with shouts of salutation did the very heavens ring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair harbourage unto the good knights they gave that city through;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the King commanded to honour his guests with tendance due;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they bound up the hurts of the wounded, and with diligent heed did they tend:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, that knightly King was gracious unto foe no less than friend.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 34}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then unto Lüdegast spake he: “Welcome to me be thou!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through thy misdeed to my kingdom hath mischief been wrought enow,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the which thou must make atonement, if this may be compassed of me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n God look on my friends and reward them: right well have they holpen me!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well mayst thou thank thine helpers,” spake Lüdiger answering:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In sooth such high-born captives had never earthly king!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now for knightly warding we tender thee goodly fee,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And pray thee for gracious dealing with them that were foes unto thee.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Unto both of you freedom from fetters,” he answered, “will I accord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So all which have fought against me abide here still in ward:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for this shall ye give me pledges that none shall leave my land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Except as I give them licence.” To the covenant gave they the hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then they led to their rest the weary, where all things ready were made.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Full soon upon easeful couches were the wounded warriors laid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they poured for the knights unwounded bright wine and mead good store:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never in mirth and joyance were hearts uplifted more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The bucklers battle-riven took they, and they laid them by,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And saddles blood-empurpled might one see plenteously;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But these caused they to be hidden, lest women should weep at the sight:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, the sun went down that even upon many a wayworn knight!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Give kindliest entertainment to my guests,” did the King command:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the native-born and with strangers now thronged was all the land:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took thought for the heedful tendance of each sore-wounded foe:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, how was their haughty defiance in humility brought low!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whosoever were cunning in leechcraft, rich guerdon their skill repaid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bright gold unstinted and silver outlavished, yea, unweighed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they would but heal those heroes who had gotten hurt in the war.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with gifts the King still loaded his guests that came from far.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And whoso of these was minded homeward to turn again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As one should entreat a dear friend, so prayed they him to remain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nor forgat the King his liegemen, but devised for them rich reward,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even all whose labour of glory had accomplished the will of their lord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 35}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake Prince Gernot his counsel: “Let our guests depart as now:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in forty days—proclaim it, and to all men publish it thou—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto a festal high-tide shall all return once more;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For healed by then shall be many that now lie wounded sore.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then made his request Prince Siegfried: “I pray you, let me depart.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But when to the Rhine-lord Gernot was known the desire of his heart,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He besought him in loving fashion for a season to tarry still:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sooth, but for the love of his sister, he had swayed him not to his will!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To a prince so royal might no man for his measureless desert\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Proffer reward; but his guerdon was the love of Gunther’s heart,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of all his friends and kinsfolk; for alway in their sight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair shone the mighty achievements that his hand had wrought in fight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said to his heart: “I will linger for the sake of Beauty’s Queen,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If at last I may haply behold her.” And so was his heart’s dream seen\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the last: after long, long waiting he beheld her, his love and his star;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then with heart all love-overflowing he rode to his home afar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the King had given commandment for tourneys day by day,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And strong young knights rode gladly in the gentle and joyous fray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he bade make ready the high-seats in the city beside Rhine-strand\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the noble guests who were bidden to the feast in Burgundia-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now as near drew the day and nearer when the guests from afar should be there,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Told was the tale of their coming unto Kriemhild the passing-fair,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of that great festal high-tide with dear-loved friends she heard—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, the heart of each winsome lady to beauty’s arraying is stirred;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they seek out wimples to deck them, and the lovely robes unfold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now to the lady Uta the tidings moreover are told\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of the coming of those proud warriors which unto the feast are bidden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forth drawn is the costly raiment in the cedar caskets hidden;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she bade for her sons’ sake fashion bright mantle and vest straightway\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the clothing of maid and matron in royal-rich array;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, doublet and cloak for vesture of the knights of Burgundy,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And withal for many a stranger much goodly bravery.\n\u003c/div\u003e
