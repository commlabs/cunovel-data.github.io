It had been several nightside hours since he had last tried to contact Lewis on their implanted communicators. Lewis definitely was out of touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be something wrong at the Redoubt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes doubted this. The finest materials were going into that base out on Black Dragon. Lewis was sparing nothing in the construction. It would be impenetrable by any force known to Pandora or Shipme.... any force, excep....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes stopped his pacing, scanned the plasteel walls of his cubby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould the Redoubt down on Pandora really insulate them from the ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine he had drunk earlier was beginning to relax him, clearing the bitter taste from his tongue. His room felt stuffy and isolated even from the ship. Let the damned ship send another Ceepee groundside. Whoever it was would be taken care of in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes let his body sag onto a couch and tried to forget the latest attack on him by the ship. He closed his eyes and drifted in a half-dream back to his beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot quite. Not quite the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not like to admit the gap. There were things he did not remember. Doubts intruded and the carrier wave of the pellet in his neck distracted him. He sent the nerve signal to turn the thing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet Lewis try to contact me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes heaved an even deeper sigh. Not the beginning - no. There were things about his beginnings that the records did not show. This ship with all the powers of a god would not or could not provide a complete background on Morgan Oakes. And the Ceepee was supposed to have access to everything. Everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything except that distant origin somewhere earthside...back on far-away Eart.... long-gone Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he had been six when his first memory images gelled and stayed with him. He even knew the year - 6001 dating from the birth of the Divine Imhotep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpring. Yes, it had been spring and he had been living in the power center, in Aegypt, in the beautiful city of Heliopolis. From the Britone March to the Underlands of Ind, all was Graeco-Roman peace fed by the Nile\u0027s bounty and enforced by the hired troopers of Aegypt. Only in the outlands of Chin and the continents of East Chin far across the Nesian Sea were there open conflicts of nations. Ye.... sprin.... and he had been living with his parents in Heliopolis. Both of his parents were on assignment with the military. This he knew from the records. His parents were perhaps the finest geneticists in the Empire. They were training for a project that was to take over young Morgan\u0027s life completely. They were preparing a trip to the stars. This, too, he was told. But that had been many years later, and too late for him to object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he remembered was a man, a black man. He liked to imagine him one of the dark priests of Aegypt that he watched every week on the viewer. The man walked past Morgan\u0027s quarters every afternoon. Where he went, and why he went only one way, Morgan never knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fence around his parents\u0027 quarters was much higher than the black man\u0027s head. It was a mesh of heavy steel curved outwards and down at the top. Every afternoon Morgan watched the man walk by, and tried to imagine how the man came to be black. Morgan did not ask his parents because he wanted to figure it out for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning at early his father said, \"The sun\u0027s going nova.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never forgot those words, those powerful words, even though he did not know their meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been kept quiet, but even the Roman Empire can\u0027t hide this heat. All the chants of all the priests of Ra won\u0027t make one damn whit of difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heat?\" his mother shot back. \"Heat is something you can live in, you can deal with. But thi....\" she waved her hand at the large window, \"this is only a step away from fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, he thought, it was the sun made that man black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ten before he realized that the man who walked past was black from birth, from conception. Still, Morgan persisted in telling the other children in his creche that it was the sun\u0027s doing. He enjoyed the secret game of persuasion and deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, the power of the game, even then!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes straightened the cushion at his back. Why did he think of that black man, now? There had been one curious event, a simple thing that caused a commotion and fixed it in his memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes could not recall being touched by anyone except his parents until that moment. On that very hot day, he sat outside on a step, cooled by the shade of the roof and the ventilator trained on his back from the doorway. The man walked by, as usual, then stopped and turned back. The boy watched him, curious, through the mesh fence, and the man studied him carefully, as though noticing him for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes recalled the sudden jump of his heart, that feeling of a slingshot pulled back, back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked around, then up at the top of the fence, and the next thing Oakes knew the man was over the top, walking up to him. The black man stopped, reached out a hesitant hand and touched the boy\u0027s cheek. Oakes also reached out, equally curious, and touched the black skin of the man\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you ever seen a little boy before?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black face widened into a smile, and he said, \"Yes, but not a little boy like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a sentry jumped on the man out of nowhere and took him away. Another sentry pulled the boy inside and called his father. He remembered that his father was angry. But best of all he remembered the look of wide-eyed wonder on the black man\u0027s face, the man who never walked by again. Oakes felt special then, powerful, an object of deference. He had always been someone to reckon with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do I remember that man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as though he spent all of his private hours asking himself questions lately. Questions led to more questions, led ultimately, daily, to the one question that he refused to admit into his consciousness. Until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe voiced the question aloud to himself, tested it on his tongue like the long-awaited wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if the damned ship is God?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-4.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
