{"id":23365,"no":16,"title":"Chapter XV","content":"\u0026nbsp;HAROLD KING was walking in the clouds. He had received a letter from J.C. Welty asking him to come to the capital at once. He stated that he was going to build a large hotel, work to begin as soon as the plans were drawn, and that King had been recommended to him as an architect. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold decided that in order to make the right kind of impression he must have some new clothes, consequently he waived his objections to going in debt for clothes and that evening visited Jackson\u0027s clothing store where he was fitted out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had made the drawings and drawn up most of the specifications for a big hotel when he was an employee in an architect\u0027s office, and these he now got together. It was fortunate he had saved them. This done he called Ruth over the \u0027phone and secured her permission to call in the evening.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n About three o\u0027clock in the afternoon Golter entered Ruth\u0027s office. \"Miss Ruth,\" he said, \"don\u0027t you want to take a ride?\" Ruth had declined many invitations to ride with Golter and refused many requests to call.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would prefer riding to pounding this typewriter this time in the afternoon, but the chances are I will have to continue to pound it until four o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am going to Zala and thought you might enjoy going along for the ride.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would like to go to Zala. I haven\u0027t been there for so long. When are you going to start?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Right away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wouldn\u0027t want to ask to quit work early.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll ask Uncle Jim for you, if you will go.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to go if Mr. Stover needs me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Golter stepped into the president\u0027s office and soon returned with the information that Uncle Jim said that she could go as soon as she finished the letter she was writing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How long will you be gone?\" she asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, we should be back by six or six-thirty. You know it is only twenty-four miles from here to Zala, and it will only take a few minutes to attend to the business.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ruth called her aunt and told her that she was going with Mr. Golter to Zala.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the way going he asked, \"What do you think of the Ku Klux Klan by this time?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She replied, \"It seems to be doing some good.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps a little good but much more harm.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do you know that it\u0027s doing harm?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know by what I read. Besides you can\u0027t expect anything but trouble from the class of people that belong.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you know about the class of people who belong?\" she asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They are mostly crooks and ne\u0027er-do-wells like that fellow King, who goes around with his coat frayed at the cuff.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. King has more to him than a whole lot of fellows who are better dressed; but how do you know who belongs?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see that that class of people have little principle and many of them give away their membership.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she said with spirit. \"I think that there are unprincipled people who work some of their bunch into the Klan for the purpose of giving it away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It certainly ruins one\u0027s standing in society when it is found out that he belongs to the hooded bunch. I wouldn\u0027t want to associate with anyone who was connected with these midnight marauders.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe in the principles of the Klan; I believe that a good class of men belong; that they are doing many charitable acts, and in many places have created more respect for law and order. If I were a man I would join this order of real red-blooded Americans.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Golter decided that he was not getting anywhere in the direction which he desired to go; he tried a new tack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was reading a new book the other day, the title of which is, \u0027The Quest for Happiness\u0027.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it good?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. It is so much more practical than many books along that line. I suppose you would call the author a materialist, but then you know that everything in this world that has any value has a material basis.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am not so sure of that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, if you will read this book you will see that his philosophy is good common sense. He shows that no matter what enjoyment one seeks one must possess material wealth to secure the means of gratification. If one desires music, he needs money to attend the concerts or provide the instruments for himself. If he loves art he is all the worse if he hasn\u0027t money with which to buy pictures or visit art galleries. Man may develop an appetite for orange sundaes but he is miserable because of this fondness if he lacks the price. He knocked the doctrine of \u0027love in a cottage\u0027 into a cocked hat. He says, how absurd to think a couple could be happy in this day and age in a little stuffy cottage without any of the modern conveniences, unable to entertain, no automobile, no money to take a trip, etc. Isn\u0027t he right?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, he isn\u0027t. Of course money has its place, and it might be very difficult to be happy in penury; but love is not dependent on rugs, furs, pianos and automobiles, which are all well enough in their place. Honesty and all of the Christian virtues are not dependent on material things. It is true that the one with the artistic taste may desire fine pictures, but if he is a true artist he will not be more miserable with the love of the beautiful within him and no money with which to purchase pictures than he would be without the aesthetic talent. Quite the opposite. He can behold the beauties of the heavens at night, the wild flowers and the birds; he can appreciate the pink hue of the dawn and the golden glow of the sunset, and enjoy the forests and ferns that jack frost paints on the window panes. To be sure, nobody wants to starve, but I am of the opinion that love will flourish no better on roast turkey and maple syrup than it will on bacon and sorghum molasses.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ruth visited with a few of her friends in Zala while Golter attended to his business. They remained in Zala a little longer than Ruth had thought they would.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they started home Ruth remarked, \"It is later than I had thought we would be here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Golter looked at his watch. \"It\u0027s only six o\u0027clock. If we have no bad luck we will be home by seven. We could drive it in much less than an hour if it weren\u0027t for that five miles of bad road.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope we can get home by seven,\" said Ruth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Anything of importance?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, there is. I had a date with Mr. King tonight.\" Ruth was not only anxious to keep the engagement with her friend but was also anxious to show Golter that his slurs and innuendos had made no other impression on her than to create a stronger desire to be more loyal to her friend. She was filled with a feeling of disgust for Golter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This information was evidently not very pleasing to Golter. He became less talkative and the conversational atmosphere became rather chilly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They had driven but a few miles when Golter stopped the car.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is the trouble?\" Ruth asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Something wrong with the engine.\" He got out and worked for fifteen minutes. Ruth felt relieved when he closed down the hood. He got into the car and they started. They had not gone far when he stopped the engine again and remarked, \"There is something wrong yet with the engine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I wish I were an automobile mechanic for a little while so that I could know whether there is really anything wrong with that engine,\" thought Ruth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold King\u0027s heart was singing a joyful melody as he went to the home of his friend, Ruth Babcock. He was happy because he had a chance at a big job. He felt more efficient because he was wearing a neat suit of clothes. There is a psychological value in clothes. A man who is poorly and shabbily clad may be ever so brilliant and honorable a man, but the shabby clothes detract from his confidence and power.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Harold reached the Babcock home he was met at the door by Aunt Clara who informed him that Miss Ruth had gone to Zala with Mr. Golter. She did not know when she would be back but presumed that it would be late, as it was a long drive to Zala, and Ruth had so many friends there that she would want to see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold was not in a pleasant frame of mind when he returned to his room. He threw himself down in a chair with a woe-begone look on his face. What a difference a half hour may make in one\u0027s spirits! How quickly the sunshine can vanish and darkness envelope us! Harold wondered whether or not Ruth really cared a great deal for Golter. He couldn\u0027t understand how a girl with the ideals and good sense that Ruth possessed could care very much for a snob like Golter. However, she must think a great deal of him when she broke her engagement with himself and went to another town with Golter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He would not let her know that he cared, except to show her he was independent. He would leave on the five o\u0027clock train the next morning for the state capital. She wouldn\u0027t know of his chance for this good job nor would she see him in his new suit. Every man desires to appear well before the woman he admires. \"She owes me an explanation, and I shall stay away from her until she makes it,\" he thought. He was not only disappointed but his pride was hurt as well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Ruth reached home at 8:30 she was informed by her aunt that Mr. King had called. She went at once to the \u0027phone and called him up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. King? This is Ruth Babcock speaking. I am very sorry that I was not at home when you called.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If it will not inconvenience you I would like to have you come tonight.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, it isn\u0027t too late.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t like to bother you if you are busy, but I would like very much to talk to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course if you don\u0027t want to come——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll expect you in a few minutes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She ate a lunch and was in readiness to receive him when he called. She noticed that he carried an injured air, and proceeded to explain at once why she was not back early as she expected. (After her explanation his feelings were considerably mollified.)\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ruth,\" he said, \"I am leaving on the four-forty train in the morning. I am going to the state capital.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you be gone long?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only a day or so. I have a chance for a big job there—a hotel. If I am fortunate enough to land it, I shall have to make several trips up there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I certainly hope you land it. You richly deserve to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pardon the intrusion,\" said Mr. Babcock, as he entered. \"How are you, Mr. King? You are certainly looking fine.\" Ruth had thought so too but had not told him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am feeling fine. I hope you are feeling better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not much change in my condition. I am reading \u0027Macbeth.\u0027 I just stepped in to get a commentary on Shakespeare. \u0027Macbeth\u0027 is a great play. Duncan and I had very bitter experiences with the man whom we trusted. Duncan was murdered by his kinsman, Macbeth, whom he had honored and in whom he had implicit confidence. I was robbed by a man whom I trusted and to whom I was foolish enough to teach the combination to my safe.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he had left the room Ruth remarked, \"Poor, dear father, he tries so hard to remember. The other night when he was reading \u0027Macbeth\u0027 he looked up from his reading and remarked, \u0027It seems to me I have read this play before.\u0027 He was only in the second act then and he laid the book down and spent the rest of the evening trying to recall the remainder of the play. He worried about it and I had a hard time to persuade him to give it up and retire at eleven-thirty. I am so anxious to take him to Dr. Lilly, and it\u0027s only going to be a little while until we can go. I have two hundred dollars in my special fund now, and when I save fifty more I am going to take him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I sincerely hope Dr. Lilly can help him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you think he can, Harold?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold had but little hopes of Dr. Lilly\u0027s being able to help her father and feared Ruth would be disappointed in the end, yet her heart was so set on it that he did not have the heart to discourage her. \"It may be he can. I have read of some wonderful cures he has made,\" he replied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you think of the coming election?\" she asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think that the Klan is going to be an important factor. It will not have as much influence as it would have had if that Rastus Jones affair had not happened.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You think that negro affair is hurting the Klan\u0027s influence?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sure it is. I heard a good man say the other day that he intended to vote for Dan Brown, the Klan candidate for sheriff, until this affair came up. I am convinced that Klansmen did not have anything to do with it, but it is hurting the Klan influence, nevertheless.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am certainly sorry if it does hurt the Klan,\" she said, her conscience smiting her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There is no question about it hurting; it has already hurt. You see there are so many who want to believe things of that kind about the Klan, and they use this episode to work on the fears of others.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Excuse me a moment, please.\" She left the room and soon called him to come into the dining room. \"I ate a lunch very hurriedly tonight and am hungry; won\u0027t you eat a lunch with me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With the greatest of pleasure.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They sat down to the table together, and while they ate Harold did most of the talking. Ruth\u0027s mind was preoccupied. When they had finished eating Ruth picked up the wish bone and held a prong of it toward Harold. \"Let\u0027s wish,\" she said, \"the one who gets the biggest piece wins, and gets his wish.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right,\" he replied, taking hold of the prong.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I tell you, let\u0027s have it that the one who wins shall have his three best wishes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Could one little chicken wishbone secure so much desire?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, if we both agree to it, it can.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They both pulled and the bone broke close to his fingers. \"There, I won. I\u0027ll get my wishes!\" she exclaimed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tell me what you wished?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no; they wouldn\u0027t come true if I were to tell.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t you ever tell me?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, when they come true.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he had told her good-night she called after him, \"Good luck on the trip.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His spirits were all together different when he entered his room for the second time that night. He set his alarm so that he might not miss the early train. Harold had a habit of reading something every night before retiring. He picked up a volume of \"The Rhymes of Ironquill\" and read a few short poems, selecting them at random. He turned to Ironquill\u0027s version of Aesop\u0027s Fables. He read \"The Swell,\" Fable No. 9.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"On the walk a hat did lie,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a gallus chap sailed by,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he cut a lively swell—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was clerk in a hotel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So, he gave that hat a kick,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he came across a brick—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now upon a crutch he goes,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Minus half a pound of toes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Moral.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When you see a person thrown\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By misfortune or by vice,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Help him thrice or seven times thrice;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Help him up or let alone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If you give the man a kick\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n You may stumble on a brick,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or a stone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fate is liable to frown,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the best of us go down;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in just a little while\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She is liable to smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the bad luck and the vice\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seem to scatter in a trice,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to hunt their holes like mice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the man you tried to kick\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now has changed into a brick.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe Fate is beginning to smile,\" he mused, \"and here\u0027s hoping that the bad luck will scatter in a trice, and it may be that some of these fellows will find some day that the man they tried to kick has turned into a brick.\" With this pleasing thought on his mind he retired and was soon fast asleep.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89883.html","bookId":491,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM"}
