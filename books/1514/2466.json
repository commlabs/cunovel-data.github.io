After which, he leaped down from the stone platform. Slightly shutting his eyes, he felt the majestic and endless Mental Energy in his Niwan Place and said, “Currently, I can only be considered to be an initial Symbol Grandmaster.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Once you step into the advance Symbol Grandmaster level, even those experts who have touched the reincarnation power will not be a match for you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That won’t be easy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong faintly smiled. After his Mental Energy had reached this level, the amount of effort and hardship needed to advance was tremendous. This time, he had borrowed the power of the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers in order to reach the initial Symbol Grandmaster level in three short months. From a certain point of view, it had not been easy to endure through these three months. Lin Dong was uncertain of just how many times he had escaped from the jaws of death during this period of time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“These things are already useless.

Presently, these demon flowers were all in states of withering. It was clear that their power had been completely exhausted. However, these demon flowers were rather bizarre. Since he no longer had any use for them, it was best to eliminate them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Aye.” Yan did not have any objections to this.

He did not give the place another glance and directly walked out of the cave. Behind him, Yan nodded and turned into a flash of light which shot into Lin Dong’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s footsteps paused as he walked out of the Heavenly Cave. He slightly tilted his body and looked towards the deepest part of the Heavenly Cave. When his Mental Energy had broken through to the Symbol Grandmaster level earlier, he had used the Ancestral Symbol eye to see the figure in the deepest part of the Heavenly Cave. He was unable to detect an overly frightening aura from the silver eyed figure, but his sharp senses told him that this person’s strength was likely also at an extremely terrifying level. So terrifying that Lin Dong would not have even the slightest chance of victory if he was to fight against this person in his current state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I wonder just which old demon it is who has survived since those ancient times…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong seemed to mutter to himself.

He did indeed need some time in order to completely free himself from the memories of Purgatory and return to his usual self.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e　　……\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong remained within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe during the next two days, and finally made a full recovery after these two days of recuperation. The cruel training within the purgatory had already been deeply buried in his mind. However, the vast and mighty Mental Energy Lin Dong had obtained still pervaded his Niwan Palace, letting him understand that the bitter training within Purgatory was not without reward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong sat on the edge of a cliff belonging to a lush green mountain. His eyes looked at the sea of trees below as he suddenly stretched. After which, he spoke in his mind, “My Mental Energy had crossed the borders of space the day I exited my retreat and I saw the Devouring Divine Palace…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Oh?” Yan cried out in a startled voice upon hearing this. Clearly, he did not expect Lin Dong to detect the existence of the Devouring Divine Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“The Devouring Divine Palace seems to be hidden in another pocket dimension. It is impossible to detect its actual location. However, I am able to sense an increasingly violent and out of control energy from that pocket dimension. Therefore… it is likely that the pocket dimension where the Devouring Divine Palace is hidden will emerge within a month.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“One month huh?

There will likely be quite a big commotion when that time comes. It is likely that the experts in the entire Demon Region will be able to detect it…” Lin Dong slightly narrowed his eyes. The Devouring Divine Palace’s appearance would definitely stir a huge commotion the moment it appeared. Given the reputation of the Devouring Master during those ancient times, it was likely that all factions will greatly covert it. Moreover, not everyone knew that the Devouring Ancestral Symbol was in Lin Dong’s hands...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTherefore, it was likely that even the four overlord tribes would have difficulty remaining calm when the Devouring Divine Palace appeared. Although Lin Dong need not be worried about the Dragon tribe and the Celestial Demon Marten tribe given his relation with them, there were still the other two equally powerful overlord tribes watching from the side. Most importantly… that omnipresent “Devil Prison” would likely also get involved when they learnt of this matter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt that time, it would not be easy for Lin Dong to obtain the inheritance of the Devouring Master in front of all those outstanding experts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“However…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong smiled.
