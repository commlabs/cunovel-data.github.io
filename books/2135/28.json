It filled my waking thoughts completely, blurring my vision enough for me to believe that what was happening to him was happening to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis happened to us sometimes. If Fang was experiencing something powerful enough, emotional enough, or exciting enough, it nearly always flooded my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it did now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, I can switch off the image, and leave Fang to his privacy. But as I sat back in my desk chair, the image I saw in my mind made me gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was of Detective Hanner. And she was hovering over Fang, straddling him. She was wearing next to nothing. The light shifted. His eyes shifted. Correction. She was, in fact, wearing nothing. Standing over him, naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t be watching this, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could turn off the image. Block it, so to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t. I continued watching, like a voyeur through a bedroom window. I watched because I suspected I knew what was going to happen. I knew it, but I wanted to be sure. I wanted to see it for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang, I saw, was naked, too. He was sitting in a chair. I could see his chest heaving. His skin was gleaming slightly. I hadn\u0027t seen him naked before. This was a first...and it was impressive. All of it...and all of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was seeing what he was seeing, and now his gaze shifted as she slowly swung a leg over him and straddled him. I felt him shiver. Heard him moan and gasp. She adjusted herself on him, reaching down, and now he moaned low and long as she slid him inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA powerful wave of pleasure swept through him and subsequently me, too. I felt him throbbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, no wonder guys love those things so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this wasn\u0027t about sex. I knew that. Fang knew it, too. This was just preparing him for what was to come. He was waiting for it. I could sense his thoughts, even if they were a bit scrambled. He was willing her to do it, to do it, to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease. Do it. Please. God, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thoughts briefly overcame mine, his line of thinking replacing mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, and nearly pulled out of the scene, but I had to see what happened next. I had to see what was going to happen to my one-time friend, Fang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo it, love. Do it, baby. Do it, do it. DO IT!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, trying to clear it, trying to focus on what was happening, but Fang\u0027s thoughts were too intense, too powerful, too overwhelming. I had two choices only: block the vision completely...or give into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI debated only briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd gave into it... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-28.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
