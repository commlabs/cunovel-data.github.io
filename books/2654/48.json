Then I looked up and was immediately disappointed. And frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the crown prince Danilo. I had not known he was back in St.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetersburg. \"What am I going to do with you, Katerina Alexandrovna?\" he said, a menacing smile on his face. \"I leave you alone briefly and you are off gall ivanting in another man\u0027s carriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do to me?\" I tried to sit up and look around but the crown prince held me fast.
