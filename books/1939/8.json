All we seemed to do was argue.\" A look of sadness came over her. \"Some people are meant to be together, I guess, and others aren\u0027t, no matter how strong the attraction is.\" She shook her head as if she wasn\u0027t sure how any of this had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I understood her correctly, Winter had reunited with Pierre after a long break and recently split up again. Hannah had obviously written her letter after the first separation. \"What about dating others during this...break?\" I asked without any subtlety or finesse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that hasn\u0027t really come up, but I don\u0027t think it would be a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. If someone encouraged you to date...say, someone like me, would you be inclined to do so?\" I asked. What I really wanted to find out was whether Hannah had written her a letter condoning--or even suggesting--a relationship between the two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If someone encouraged me?\" She watched me curiously. \"Like who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know. Someone like a friend or--\" I hesitated \"--or perhaps a relative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Ritchie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not specifically.\" Obtaining the information was harder than I\u0027d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t need anyone to encourage me, Michael,\" she said, smiling across the table at me. \"I\u0027ve always thought the world of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back, thanking her, but I had no idea what else to say. I hadn\u0027t actually asked her out--not intentionally, anyway--but she\u0027d assumed I was trying to initiate a relationship. This was embarrassing. I wasn\u0027t sure how to extricate myself now that I\u0027d brought it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left it open-ended, so that she\u0027d get in touch with me. A short time later I walked away, confused and bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no better alternative, I drove to Ritchie\u0027s house. My brother-in-law was in his garage; the door was open and I could see him puttering around inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went out to the driveway to greet me. \"Hey, this is a surprise. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just had coffee with Winter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you two finally connected.\" I followed him back to the garage and leaned against his workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are Steph and Max?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shopping. Max has a baseball game later this afternoon. I\u0027m taking him to that. Wanna tag along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t need an excuse to see Max. I was fond of my nephew. He loved his Xbox and, because of that, I\u0027d cultivated the skill; we spent hours battling each other. He had top score and it wasn\u0027t because I wasn\u0027t trying. The kid was a natural. \"Glad to,\" I told Ritchie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were silent for a moment. \"Well, don\u0027t keep me in suspense,\" Ritchie said, crossing his arms. \"How did the meeting with my cousin go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"All right, I guess.\" Before I could say anything more, Ritchie started talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking over what you told me about Hannah\u0027s letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sister put Winter\u0027s name first for a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\" I was only coming to terms with this whole letter thing now, but I wasn\u0027t convinced that I could do what Hannah had asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah knew Winter the best and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winter\u0027s involved with some Frenchman,\" I said, cutting him off. \"They\u0027ve been seeing each other for quite a while. It makes me wonder why Hannah would even include her. Pierre and Winter must\u0027ve been on their first, uh, hiatus, but still...\" In any event, I wasn\u0027t up to hearing what a perfect match the other woman was for me. Not from Ritchie and not from Hannah, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s involved with someone else?\" This quickly flattened Ritchie\u0027s enthusiasm. \"You ever heard of this guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. I\u0027m pretty sure Hannah told me about him. Also that he and Winter split up--but then they got back together. After Hannah died, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me blankly and I felt compelled to continue. \"Now they\u0027re taking a break from each other. They haven\u0027t broken up, they\u0027re taking a break,\" I repeated, trying to emphasize the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that mean?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I know. Sounds like something a woman would think up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long is this break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few months, she said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she mention how far they were into this...temporary break-up?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t thought to ask. \"No. But,\" I added, \"she\u0027s going to call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie nodded. \"What she\u0027s telling you is that there are problems in that relationship,\" Ritchie explained knowledgeably, as if he had a post-graduate degree in Understanding Women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be my guess,\" I agreed amiably enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re free to step in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said automatically. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problems or not, she\u0027s in love with Pierre.\" At least the two of us could talk about the people we loved. And it wouldn\u0027t be each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so willing to give up. Ask her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chortled, reluctant to admit what a mess I\u0027d made of our meeting. \"Winter more or less assumed I\u0027d contacted her for exactly that reason. But I didn\u0027t ask her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie cocked his head to one side. \"She\u0027s interested, though, if she said she\u0027ll get back to you. Isn\u0027t that obvious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was obvious to me at the moment. \"Do you think Hannah might have written more than one letter?\" I needed Ritchie\u0027s opinion on this. I suspected she hadn\u0027t, but her brother knew her well, almost as well as I did...had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy question apparently gave him pause. Then he shook his head. \"Who would\u0027ve delivered them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good point.\" That settled it in my mind. There was only the one letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah might suggest dating these other women to you, but I doubt she\u0027d discuss it with them.\" Ritchie rubbed the side of his jaw. \"No,\" he added. \"I\u0027m fairly confident Hannah just wrote one letter. Yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded slowly, reassured on that count. My encounters with Winter and the other two women--if I called them--would be awkward enough without more letters from Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Winter\u0027s interested, then I say go out with her,\" Ritchie urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said adamantly. \"It\u0027d be a waste of time for both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so sure. Remember, Hannah put her name first on the list, and there was a reason for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what she wanted, Michael. You aren\u0027t going to ignore my sister\u0027s last wish, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave it to Ritchie to hit below the belt. \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" I muttered. But I already had a feeling that Winter and I would never find happiness together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaybe she shouldn\u0027t have been surprised, but it\u0027d been good to see Michael again. Winter Adams wasn\u0027t sure how to react when she got the message that her cousin\u0027s husband had stopped by. She hadn\u0027t called him right away; she\u0027d had no idea what to say once she did. She\u0027d always liked Michael and missed Hannah terribly. Her relationship had been with Hannah, though, and because she was usually working the dinner shift, she hadn\u0027t socialized with them as a couple all that much. Which made the whole situation a bit uncomfortable. Nevertheless, she felt she had to return his call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he ask you out?\" Alix asked when Winter carried the plate and two empty coffee mugs to the dishwasher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she answered honestly. Still mulling over the conversation, she went into her office and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael might be interested, but Winter belonged with the man she loved. Pierre Dubois. The past three weeks without him had been painful. Bleak. Her life was complicated and she\u0027d probably done Michael a disservice by not explaining the situation better. She was involved with Pierre and had been for a long while, although they\u0027d decided to take a three-month break from each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she\u0027d told Michael, this wasn\u0027t the first time they\u0027d split up. Technically, this wasn\u0027t a split; it was more of a breather while they analyzed what was wrong with their relationship. Two years earlier Pierre and Winter had broken it off for good. At the time it had seemed for the best, since they were constantly arguing, constantly at odds. They spent fifteen months apart. Winter had been miserable without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring those months, she\u0027d visited Hannah often, both at the hospital and at home. When Michael was busy, Winter sat with her cousin and poured out her heart. Hannah had been such a sympathetic listener. She\u0027d assured Winter over and over that one day she\u0027d meet a man who would make her happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, shortly after Hannah\u0027s death, she\u0027d run into Pierre in downtown Seattle. Winter\u0027s heart had started beating furiously at the sight of him. She\u0027d missed Pierre each and every day, but had worked hard to convince herself that she\u0027d gotten along fine without him. At first their meeting had been awkward. They\u0027d exchanged the briefest of pleasantries and gone their separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they\u0027d met again, a few minutes later in a department store. They\u0027d laughed, a bit nervously, Pierre had made a joke about it and they\u0027d headed in opposite directions--only to meet a third time outside the store. Pierre had laughed and suggested they have coffee at a nearby Starbucks. They\u0027d talked for three hours. He said he\u0027d never stopped thinking about her. Winter admitted how much she\u0027d missed their quiet, intimate evenings together. The nights they cuddled in front of the television and discussed menus and cooking techniques while the program aired with barely a notice. They were two of a kind in their perfectionism and their passion for food and cooking; that shared interest had drawn them together in the first place. Unfortunately, they were both stubborn and so sure of their own visions--about food, life and everything else--that they tended to clash. Winter had come to recognize that she could be uncompromising. But no more than Pierre!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of that day, they\u0027d decided to give it one more try, determined to make their relationship work. They felt that if they made a sincere effort, and it succeeded, they should consider marriage. They left the coffee shop with their arms tightly around each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine months later they were at odds again. Winter didn\u0027t know how it\u0027d happened. All she knew was that they were miserable--miserable together and miserable apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn view of their history, they\u0027d agreed to take a threemonth \"sabbatical\" from each other. Pierre had gone so far as to set the date they\u0027d meet to make a final decision. Winter had marked it on her calendar and circled the day. Until then, they were to have no contact at all. July 1, they would either go forward or end the relationship once and for all. This time there\u0027d be no going back. They were in love, but what they needed now was a way to make their love work--a way that brought them happiness and fulfillment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they\u0027d first met, Winter had recently graduated from cooking school and Pierre had been her boss at a seafood restaurant--part of an upscale chain--that catered primarily to tourists. He\u0027d been recruited by the chain after receiving his training in France. His parents were chefs, too, and the family had moved to the States for a few years when he was in his teens. They\u0027d eventually gone back to France. Pierre, however, considered Seattle home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-8.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
