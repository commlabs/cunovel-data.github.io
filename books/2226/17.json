We\u0027re lucky David caught it. It was a real heads-up play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re after a pass-key, not jewelry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Strathmore said, \"but I think they might be one and the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan looked lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe motioned to the tracer on her screen. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore sighed heavily and began pacing. \"Apparently, there were witnesses to Tankado\u0027s death. According to the officer at the morgue, a Canadian tourist called the Guardia this morning in a panic-he said a Japanese man was having a heart attack in the park. When the officer arrived, he found Tankado dead and the Canadian there with him, so he radioed the paramedics. While the paramedics took Tankado\u0027s body to the morgue, the officer tried to get the Canadian to tell him what happened. All the old guy did was babble about some ring Tankado had given away right before he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan eyed him skeptically. \"Tankado gave away a ring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Apparently he forced it in this old guy\u0027s face-like he was begging him to take it. Sounds like the old guy got a close look at it.\" Strathmore stopped pacing and turned. \"He said the ring was engraved-with some sort of lettering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lettering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and according to him, it wasn\u0027t English.\" Strathmore raised his eyebrows expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Japanese?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore shook his head. \"My first thought too. But get this-the Canadian complained that the letters didn\u0027t spell anything. Japanese characters could never be confused with our Roman lettering. He said the engraving looked like a cat had gotten loose on a typewriter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan laughed. \"Commander, you don\u0027t really think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore cut her off. \"Susan, it\u0027s crystal clear. Tankado engraved the Digital Fortress pass-key on his ring. Gold is durable. Whether he\u0027s sleeping, showering, eating-the pass-key would always be with him, ready at a moment\u0027s notice for instant publication.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan looked dubious. \"On his finger? In the open like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Spain isn\u0027t exactly the encryption capital of the world. Nobody would have any idea what the letters meant. Besides, if the key is a standard sixty-four-bit-even in broad daylight, nobody could possibly read and memorize all sixty-four characters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan looked perplexed. \"And Tankado gave this ring to a total stranger moments before he died? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore\u0027s gaze narrowed. \"Why do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Susan only a moment before it clicked. Her eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore nodded. \"Tankado was trying to get rid of it. He thought we\u0027d killed him. He felt himself dying and logically assumed we were responsible. The timing was too coincidental. He figured we\u0027d gotten to him, poison or something, a slow-acting cardiac arrestor. He knew the only way we\u0027d dare kill him is if we\u0027d found North Dakota.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan felt a chill. \"Of course,\" she whispered. \"Tankado thought that we neutralized his insurance policy so we could remove him too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all coming clear to Susan. The timing of the heart attack was so fortunate for the NSA that Tankado had assumed the NSA was responsible. His final instinct was revenge. Ensei gave away his ring as a last-ditch effort to publish the pass-key. Now, incredibly, some unsuspecting Canadian tourist held the key to the most powerful encryption algorithm in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan sucked in a deep breath and asked the inevitable question. \"So where is the Canadian now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore frowned. \"That\u0027s the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The officer doesn\u0027t know where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The Canadian\u0027s story was so absurd that the officer figured he was either in shock or senile. So he put the old guy on the back of his motorcycle to take him back to his hotel. But the Canadian didn\u0027t know enough to hang on; he fell off before they\u0027d gone three feet-cracked his head and broke his wrist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" Susan choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The officer wanted to take him to a hospital, but the Canadian was furious-said he\u0027d walk back to Canada before he\u0027d get on the motorcycle again. So all the officer could do was walk him to a small public clinic near the park. He left him there to get checked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan frowned. \"I assume there\u0027s no need to ask where David is headed.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-17.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM"}
