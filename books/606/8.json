{"id":20145,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A DASH FOR THE SHORE.","content":"Strange to say, Clif was not much excited at the terrific moment. The peril was so great that he was quite gay as he faced it. He had risen to the occasion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He picked himself up and stepped out to the deck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There he found a scene of confusion indescribable. Above the noise of the breakers on the shore and the waves that were flinging themselves against the exposed side of the ship rang the wild shrieks and cries of the terrified Spanish prisoners.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The vessel after she had struck had been flung around and was being turned farther over every minute. The violence of the storm that was struggling with her was quite inconceivable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The waves were pouring over her in great masses, sweeping everything before them; and the spray was leaping so high and the flying storm clouds driving past so low that there was no telling where the surface of the sea ended and the air began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The big ship had landed among rocks, and every wave was lifting her up and flinging her down upon them with dull, grinding crashes that could be both heard and felt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment after she struck a man came dashing up the ladder to the deck; it was one of the sailors, and behind were the terrified firemen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s leaking in a dozen places!\" the man shouted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He clung to railing as he spoke, and a great wave half drowned him; but he managed to salute, and Clif saw a look of wild delight on his face, one that just corresponded with his own eager mood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027ll split in about half a minute, I fancy,\" the cadet answered, \"and the Spaniards are welcome to what\u0027s left. We\u0027ve done our duty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that he turned to the pilot house, where the rest of the men were grouped. They were gazing at him eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you ready, boys?\" Clif shouted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Every one knew what he meant by \"ready\"—ready to make the wild attempt to land and reach the shore through all those wildly surging breakers. The very thought of it was enough to stir one\u0027s blood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the answer came with a vengeance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay, ay, sir!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then get out one of the boats,\" shouted Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he saw the men struggling forward to reach the nearest rowboat he turned suddenly on his heel. He had something else to attend to for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was an errand of mercy. Those shrieking wretches were all bound to the railing of the doomed ship, and Clif would never have forgiven himself if he had left them there. Their faces would have haunted him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he drew his sword and set swiftly to work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He cut the captain loose and put a knife into his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get to work!\" he cried. \"Get to work!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif took the risk of trusting the man, and went on, leaving him with the weapon. The cadet believed that he would be grateful for his release.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And besides they were fellow sufferers then, threatened with the same peril.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif was not mistaken. The man set hastily to work releasing his comrades, and in less time than it takes to tell it the terrified men were huddled together on the deck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cadet wasted no more time upon them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There are three boats left for you,\" he cried. \"Save yourselves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that he turned and made his way down to where his own men were struggling with one of the small boats.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was one other thing which in the wild confusion of that moment Clif managed to remember needed to be attended to. There was Ignacio!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The treacherous Spaniard had nearly been swept off, and he was half drowned by the floods of water that poured over the deck. But his hatred of the Americans was too great for him to shout to them for aid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What to do with that murderous villain was a problem that worried Clif. Undoubtedly the wisest thing would be to kill him, then and there; death was the fate he certainly deserved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif half drew his sword; but it was no use. He could not bring himself to do such an act. And he flung the weapon back into the scabbard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To attempt to carry him away was equally useless; the Americans did not expect to reach the shore themselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll leave him to his fate,\" Clif muttered. \"The Spaniards may help him if they choose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that he turned toward the sailors again; the men had by that time nearly succeeded in getting the boat away. They were working like Trojans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Every wave that struck the ship helped to fill the boat, even before it touched the water; the spray poured down over the slanting deck upon it and the sailors had to empty it several times.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While they were wrestling thus the wind and water and rocks had been getting in their work upon the doomed vessel. Lower and lower she sank, harder and harder she pounded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then suddenly a great billow heaved itself with a thud against the bow and fairly hammered it around. One of the sailors gave a yell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s split!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And sure enough, a great seam had opened amidships and the water surged in with a roar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The vessel seemed fairly falling to pieces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And such being the case the sailors had no time to delay. The frail boat was lowered into the seething waters; the men tumbled in and seized the oars. Clif made a wild leap and caught the stern just as one mighty wave raced by and whirled the boat away from the vessel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And in one instant it was lost to sight and sound. What was done by the Spaniards no one could see a thing. The Americans were fighting for their own lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was but one thing for them to do——\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pull for the shore, sailors, pull for the shore.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the great sweeping breakers to aid them. In fact they were flung in so fast that they could hardly row.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a thrilling struggle, that race with the giant waves. The sailors struggled with all their might, keeping the frail craft straight. And Clif, with a bucket he had thought to bring, was bailing frantically, and shouting to encourage the men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In, in they swept, nearer, with the speed of a whirlwind, toward the shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If it\u0027s rocks, Heaven help us!\" Clif gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed an age to him, that brief struggle. Breathless and eager, he watched the great white caps breaking, smiting against the stern, struggling to turn that boat but a few inches so that they might catch it on the side and fling it over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And meanwhile the wind and waves and oars all helping, on swept the boat—bounding over the foamy crests, sinking into the great hollows, leaping and straining, but still shooting on in the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And every second was precious, for the shore was not far away; the roar of the surf grew louder—louder almost upon them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then suddenly one great seething billow came rushing up behind. Clif saw it, and shouted to the men. In a second more its white crest towered over them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was just on the point of breaking in a giant cataract of foam; it would have buried the little boat and its occupants beneath tons of foaming water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it was just a second too late. The little boat\u0027s stern shot up; for a moment it was almost on end, and then it rose to the top of the wave and a moment later as the crash came and the sweep in toward shore began the frail craft was flung forward as if from a catapult.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And in it shot with speed that simply dazed the Americans; but it was toward shore—toward shore!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They had passed the breakers!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif gave a gasp of delight as he felt the wild leap forward. It seemed but a second more before the rush ended.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bow of the rowboat struck and the frail object was whirled round and flung over, its occupants being fairly hurled into the air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they struck the water it was to find themselves within a few feet of dry land. They staggered to a standing position to find that they were in water only up to their waists. And the great wave was tugging them out to sea again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They struggled forward wildly, clutching at each other. A minute later, breathless, exhausted and half drowned, but wild with joy, they staggered out upon a sandy beach and sank down to gasp for breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re safe!\" panted Clif. \"Safe!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Safe! And on the island of Cuba, the stronghold of their deadly enemies!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3248/89004.html","bookId":606,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM"}
