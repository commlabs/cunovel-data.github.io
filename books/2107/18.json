Indeed, the young scholar was nearly as overcome as the dwarf. Pikel had been a dear friend, always ready to listen to Cadderly\u0027s latest wild idea, and always adding an emphatic \"Oo oi!\" just to make Cadderly feel good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly had never known the pangs of a friend\u0027s death. His mother had died when he was very young, but he didn\u0027t remember that. He saw the priests of Ilmater and the dead gluttons in the kitchen, but they were only faces to him, distant and unknown. Now, looking at dear Pikel, he didn\u0027t know how he should feel. didn\u0027t know what he could do. It seemed a macabre game, and for the very first time in his life, Cadderly understood that some things were beyond his power to control or change, that all his rationale, his intelligence, in the final estimation seemed just a minor thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye should\u0027ve been a druid,\" Ivan said quietly. \"Ye always were better under the sky than the stone.\" Ivan let out a great cry and buried his head in Pikel\u0027s chest, his shoulders shuddering uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly could understand the dwarfs pain, but he was shocked nonetheless that Ivan was so openly emotional. The priest wondered if something was wrong with him for not falling over Pikel as Ivan had done, or if Ivan\u0027s love for his brother was so much greater than his own feelings for the dwarf. Cadderly kept his wits about him; no matter how agonizing Pikel\u0027s death was, if they did not move on and close the bottle, many others would share a similar fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must go,\" Cadderly said softly to Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut yer mouth!\" Ivan roared, on the verge of an explosion, never taking his gaze from his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response caught Cadderly by surprise, but again he did not understand the nature of grief, did not know if it was Ivan who was acting out of sorts or if he was. When the dwarf finally did look back at him, tears streaked his contorted face and Cadderly feared that he knew what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The curse,\" he muttered breathlessly. As far as he could tell, this red mist worked to exaggerate one\u0027s emotions. Apparently the curse had found a hold in Ivan\u0027s sincere grief, a chink in the tough dwarfs magic-resistant constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly feared that it was taking hold of Ivan. The dwarfs blubbering increased with each passing moment; he could hardly draw breath, so violent was his weeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ivan,\" he said quietly, moving over to put a hand on the dwarfs shoulder. \"We can do no more for Pikel. Come away now. We have other business to attend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan snapped an angry glare on Cadderly and smacked his hands away. \"Ye\u0027re wanting me to leave him?\" the dwarf cried. \"Me brother! Me dead brother! No, I\u0027m not going, never going. I\u0027ll stay by me brother\u0027s side. Stay here and keep me Pikel druid warm!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is dead, Ivan,\" Cadderly said through his own budding sniffles. \"Gone. You cannot keep the warmth in his body. You cannot do anything for him\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut yer mouth!\" Ivan roared again, reaching for his axe. Cadderly thought the dwarf meant to chop him down, feared that Ivan blamed him for what had happened to Pikel, but Ivan never even found the strength to lift the heavy weapon and instead tumbled back down over Pikel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly realized that he would get nowhere reasoning with the grieving dwarf, but Ivan\u0027s outburst incited other ideas in the young scholar. There was one emotion that could overrule even grief, and Ivan seemed all too willing to let that emotion take charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do nothing,\" Cadderly said again, \"but repay the one who did this to Pikel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Cadderly had Ivan\u0027s full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is down here, Ivan,\" Cadderly prodded, though he didn\u0027t like leading the dwarf on like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pikel\u0027s killer is down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The imp!\" Ivan roared, looking around wildly for the creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Cadderly replied, \"not the imp, but the imp\u0027s master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The imp\u0027s what poisoned me brother!\" Ivan protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but the imp\u0027s master brought the imp, and the curse, and all the evil that led to Pikel\u0027s demise,\" replied Cadderly. He knew he was taking license in drawing such conclusions, but if he could get Ivan moving, then it would be worth the deceit. \"If we can defeat the master, then the imp and all the evil will follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The master, Ivan,\" Cadderly said again, \"he who brought the curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye brought the curse,\" Ivan snarled, fingering his two-headed axe again and eyeing Cadderly suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Cadderly quickly corrected, seeing his conniving tactics taking an entirely different light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I played an unfortunate role in its release, but I did not bring it. There is one down here-there must be-who brought the curse and sent the skeletons and the imp down here after us, down here to kill your brother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\" Ivan cried, springing up from Pikel and clasping his heavy axe in both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s me brother\u0027s killer?\" The dwarfs eyes darted all about wildly, as if he expected some new monster to appear at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must find him,\" Cadderly prodded. \"We can go back the way we came, back into the tunnels I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back?\" The idea didn\u0027t seem to please Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just until I remember the way, Ivan,\" Cadderly explained, \"then we\u0027ll go forward, to the room with the cursed bottle, to where we shall find your brother\u0027s killer.\" He could only hope his words were true and that Ivan would relax by the time they found the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forward!\" Ivan yelled, and he scooped up one of the barely glowing torches, whipped it about frantically to refuel the flame, and stormed off back the way they had come. Cadderly checked to make certain that he had all of his belongings, said a final good-bye to Pikel, and ran to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had not gone far when they came upon the first group of skeletons, five monsters wandering down a side passage. The disoriented skeletons, refugees from Druzil\u0027s disastrous battle, made no move to attack, but Ivan, blind with rage, turned on them with a fury that Cadderly had never before imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ivan, no,\" Cadderly pleaded, seeing the dwarfs intent. \"Let them alone. We have more important\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan never heard him. The dwarf let out a roar and a snarl and rushed at the skeletons. The two closest turned to meet the charge, but Ivan overwhelmed them. He launched a mighty side cut with his axe that cleaved one in half, then shifted the weapon\u0027s momentum as it whirled behind him and drove it straight over his head, coming down on top of the second skeleton with enough force to shatter the monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan let go of the weapon, entangled once more in bones, and caught the third skeleton with his deer-homed helmet, lifting the monster dear of the ground, shaking it wildly for a moment, then slamming it into the wall. The attack damaged the skeleton, but it also dislodged Ivan\u0027s helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clawing fingers of the fourth skeleton found an opening in the dwarfs defenses and dug into the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly came running down to help, readying his walking stick for a swing at Ivan\u0027s newest attacker. Before he could get into the fray, though, Ivan took things into Percival own hands. He reached around and caught the skeleton by its bony wrist, then pulled and spun for all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly dove for the ground, nearly sliced by the flying skeleton\u0027s legs and feet. Ivan picked up momentum in Percival twirl and soon had the skeleton spinning straight out at arms\u0027 length. He let the momentum build for a moment, then shuffled a step closer to a wall and let the bricks do Percival work. The skeleton slammed against them and broke apart and Ivan was left holding an unattached bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of the skeletons was on the dwarf then, and Ivan, dizzy and a bit disoriented, took the monster\u0027s first clawing hand squarely in the face. Again Cadderly started to help Percival friend, but one of the other skeletons was back up and closing, still bearing Ivan\u0027s helmet entangled in its ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan slammed a forearm into his attacker\u0027s ribs. The dwarf\u0027s stubby legs pumped wildly, driving the monster back toward a wall. When it pressed in, Ivan did not stop. His every muscle tensed and then snapped, launching him forward and bringing the only weapon he had available, his forehead, to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed the skeleton in the face, and the creature\u0027s skull exploded in the crush between the rock wall and the dwarfs equally tough head. Bits of bone popped out to the sides, other pieces were ground into dust, and Ivan bounced back, Percival head badly gashed. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly smacked at the remaining monster with Percival walking stick and snapped Percival spindle-disks into its face once and then again. The stubborn creature came on, slashing its bony fingers and forcing Cadderly into retreat. Soon, though, Cadderly felt the wall at his back and had nowhere left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hand had latched firmly onto Cadderly\u0027s shoulder. The other slashed at his face. He got his own hand up to block but found himself helplessly pinned with the bony fingers digging deeper into His flesh. He tried desperately to hook the skeleton\u0027s arm under his own, to twist it around and break the monster\u0027s grasp, but Cadderly\u0027s attack was designed to twist muscles and tendons and inflict such pain on an attacker as to disable him. Skeletons had no muscles or tendons and felt no pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly put his one free hand against the skeleton\u0027s face and tried to push it away-and got a wicked bite on the wrist for his efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the skeleton\u0027s head disappeared in an instant, went flying away. Cadderly didn\u0027t understand until Ivan\u0027s second axe chop, a downward cut, destroyed the skeletal body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly leaned back against the wall and clutched at his bloodied wrist. He simply dismissed his own pain a moment later, thinking his wounds minor indeed when he looked upon Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePieces of skull bone were embedded in the dwarfs forehead. Blood ran freely down Ivan\u0027s face, along the sides of his neck, and from numerous cuts on his gnarly hands. Even more horrifying, a skeleton\u0027s broken rib bone stuck out from the side of the dwarfs abdomen. Cadderly could not tell how deeply the bone had gone, but the wound seemed wicked indeed and he was truly amazed that the dwarf was still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for Ivan, meaning to support his friend, fearing that Ivan would topple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan roughly slapped his hand away. \"No time for coddling,\" the dwarf barked. \"Where\u0027s the one that killed me brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need help,\" Cadderly replied, horrified by his friend\u0027s condition. \"Your wounds ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget them,\" Ivan retorted. \"Get me to the one that killed me brother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Ivan,\" Cadderly continued to protest. He pointed to the skeletal rib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan\u0027s eyes did widen when he noticed the ghastly wound, but he only shrugged his shoulders, reached down to grasp the bone, and pulled it free, casually tossing it aside as though he hadn\u0027t even noticed the several inches of bloodstains upon it. Ivan\u0027s attitude was similarly uncaring when he tried to put his helmet back on, only to find that the embedded bones blocked him from seating it correctly on his head. He plucked a few chips from his forehead, then, with a grunt, forced the helmet into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly could only assume that the cursing mist had increased the dwarfs rage to a point where Ivan simply did not acknowledge pain. He knew that dwarves were a tough lot, Ivan more than most, but this was beyond belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye said ye\u0027d take me to him!\" Ivan roared, and his words rang like a threat in Cadderly\u0027s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye said ye\u0027d find the way!\" In a move of concession, Ivan reached up and tore off Cadderly\u0027s cloak and used it to quickly tie off his wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly had to be satisfied with that. He knew that the best he could do for everybody, Ivan included, was to find and dose the smoking bottle as quickly as he could. Only then would the enraged dwarf allow Cadderly or anyone else to tend to his injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then, but Cadderly was not so certain that Ivan would make it that far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey soon came back to the original areas where they had encountered the undead monsters. All was quiet now, deathly still, giving Cadderly the opportunity to carefully reconstruct his first passage through. He thought that he was making some progress, leading Ivan down several adjoining passages, when he noticed some movement far down one hall, at the very edge of his narrow light beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan noticed it, too, and he set off at once. his grief for his dead brother transferred again into uncontrollable battle lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly fumbled with his bandolier and tried futility to keep up with the dwarf, pleading with Ivan to let this enemy go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a single skeleton this time, wandering aimlessly at first, but then coming straight in at the charging dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly came to a very important decision at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his light beam in one hand and his loaded crossbow in the other, lining both up between the horns of the dwarfs helmet at the skeletal face beyond. Cadderly had never intended his custom-designed crossbow to be used as a weapon, especially not while firing the exploding darts. He had designed the bow for opening locked doors, or blasting away troublesome tree branches that scraped against his window, or a variety of other nonviolent purposes. Also, he had to admit, he had designed the crossbow and the bolts in part for the simple challenge of designing them. But Cadderly had vowed to himself, as much as an excuse as anything else, never to use the darts or the bow as a weapon, never to unleash the concentrated violence of the explosive darts against a living target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arguments in this instance were many, of course. Ivan could ill afford another fight, even against a single skeleton, and the skeleton, after all, was not really a living creature. Still, Cadderly\u0027s guilt hovered over him as he took aim. He knew that he was breaking the spirit of his vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fired. The bolt arced over Ivan\u0027s head and crashed into the charging skeleton\u0027s face. The initial impact wasn\u0027t so great, but then the dart collapsed, setting off the oill of impact. When the dust cleared a moment later, the skeleton\u0027s head and neck were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headless bones stood a moment longer, then dropped with a rattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan, just a few strides away, stopped abruptly and stared in amazement, his jaw hanging open and his dark eyes wide. He turned slowly back to Cadderly, who only shrugged apologetically and looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had to be done,\" Cadderly remarked, more to himself than to Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ye did it well!\" Ivan replied, coming back down the passage. He clapped Cadderly on the back, though Cadderly did not feel heroic in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us go on,\" Cadderly said quietly, slipping the crossbow back into its wide and shallow sheath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crossed under another low archway, Cadderly beginning to believe that they were again on the right path, and then came to a fork in the dusty passage. Two tunnels ran out from the one, parallel and very near together. Cadderly thought for a moment, then started down the right side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went only a few steps, though, before he recognized his location more clearly. He backtracked, ignoring Ivan\u0027s grumbling, and moved at a determined pace down the left passage. This corridor went on for just a short distance, then angled farther to the left and opened into a wider passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding sarcophagi filled the alcove in this passage, confirmation to Cadderly that he had chosen the right path. A few steps in and beyond a slight bend, he knew beyond doubt. Far in front of them, at the end of the passage, loomed a door, cracked open and with light shining through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the place?\" Ivan demanded, though he had already guessed the answer. He started off before Cadderly nodded in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Cadderly tried futility to slow the dwarfs charge, desiring a more cautious approach. He was just a couple of steps behind Ivan when the last sarcophagus swung open and a mummy stepped out to block the way. Too enraged to care, Ivan continued on undaunted, but Cadderly no longer followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young scholar was frozen with fear, stricken by the sheer evilness of the powerful undead presence. The skeletons had been terrifying, but they seemed only minor inconveniences next to this monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irrational,\" Cadderly tried to tell himself. It was acceptable to be afraid, but ridiculous to let that fear paralyze him in so urgent a situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outta me way!\" Ivan roared, bearing in. He chopped viciously with his axe, scoring a hit, but, unlike the battle against the skeletons, the weapon met stiff resistance this time. The mummy\u0027s thick wraps deflected much of the blow\u0027s force, and pieces of the linen came unraveled, snarling the axe-head and preventing Ivan from following through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hit hardly hindered the mummy. It clubbed with its arm, catching Ivan on the shoulder and sending him spinning into the nearest alcove. He crashed heavily and nearly swooned but stubbornly, unsteadily, forced himself back to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mummy was waiting for him. A second hit knocked the dwarf down to his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would have been the end of Ivan Bouldershoulder had it not been for Cadderly. His first attack was almost inadvertent, for the mummy, in going after Ivan, crossed the direct, narrow beam of Cadderly\u0027s fight tube. A creature of the night, of a dark and lightless world, Khalif was neither accustomed to, nor tolerant of, brightness of any kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the mummy recoil and lift its scabrous arm to block the beam restored a bit of composure in Cadderly. He kept the fight focused on the monster, forcing it back from Ivan, while he nimbly loaded another dart with his free hand. Cadderly held no reservations about using his crossbow on this monster; the mummy was simply too hideous for his conscience to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill shielding its eyes, the mummy advanced on Cadderly, slapping at the beam of fight with every sliding step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first dart buried itself deeply into the mummy\u0027s chest before exploding, and the blast sent the monster back a couple of steps and left scorch marks both front and back on the creature\u0027s linen wrappings. If it had suffered any serious damage, though, the mummy didn\u0027t show it, for it came on again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly scrambled to reload the crossbow. His design had been good, fortunately, and the crank was not difficult to execute. A second dart joined the first, again driving the monster backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mummy came on again, and again after Cadderly had shot it a third time, and each time its stubborn advance brought it a step or two closer to the frantic young man. The fourth shot proved disastrous to Cadderly, for the dart\u0027s initial momentum drove it right through the mummy without ever igniting the magical oil. The mummy hardly slowed and Cadderly nearly held the crossbow right against its filthy wrappings when he fired his fifth shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the dart had more effect, but again it only slowed, and did not stop, the monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly had no time to load another dart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming!\" slurred Ivan as he crawled from the alcove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly doubted that the dwarf could help him, even if Ivan could reach the monster in time, which he obviously couldn\u0027t. The young scholar knew, too, that neither of his conventional weapons, spindle-disks or walking stick, could hurt this monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had just one weapon to use. He stuck the light tube out in front of him, slowing the mummy further, causing it to shield its eyes and half turn away from him, then he dropped his crossbow and reached with his free hand for the water skin hanging at his side. He grabbed it by the extended nozzle, tucked it tight under his arm, and used his thumb to pop off its gooey cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly squeezed with his arm, slowly and steadily sending a stream of the blessed water into his attacker\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holy water sizzled as it struck the evilly enchanted monster and, for the first time in the battle, the mummy revealed its agony. It let out an unearthly, spine-chilling wail that filled Cadderly with fear and even stopped Ivan- temporarily. It was the proverbial bark with no bite, for while the mummy continued to advance, it purposely shied away from the man with the light beam and the stinging water. Soon it had passed Cadderly altogether, but it continued down the passage, roaring with pain and frustration, clubbing with its powerful arms against the walls, the sarcophagi, and anything else that got in its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan came rushing past Cadderly, intent on resuming the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man who killed your brother is behind the door!\" Cadderly cried as quickly as he could, desperate to stop the dwarf this time. He couldn\u0027t know the truth of his claim, of course, but at that critical moment, he would have said anything to turn Ivan around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePredictably, Ivan did wheel about. He let out a growl and charged back past Cadderly, forgetting all about the fleeing mummy, his unblinking eyes glued instead on the door at the end of the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly saw disaster coming. He recalled the newly constructed wall in the wine cellar and the blasts that had followed Pikel\u0027s battering-ram charger He had to believe that this door might also be magically warded, and he saw that the door was heavy, iron-bound.
