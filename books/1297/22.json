Scamander attacks him with all his waves: Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This Combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor\u0027s shape, and while he pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The same day continues.
