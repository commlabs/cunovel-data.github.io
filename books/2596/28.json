But she stood, uncomplaining, right inside the door, her arms folded, her back to the wall, allowing for us to take as much time as we wanted. She was wearing her white coat, even her name tag, and white pants. Her shoes were black, simple. Her hair was brushed back from her face. She didn\u0027t look at me. I was glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls were white. So was the tile floor. There was all kinds of equipment in the room, monitors, wires, tubing, tanks, but it was shut off and retired to the sidelines and into the corners. The windows were covered with white metal blinds, shutting out the colorful night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiravelle, dressed primly in a long pink cotton nightgown, cried quietly. Oberon, in white silk pajamas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand robe, merely observed with those half-mast gleaming eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona stood silent, the wanderer in safari clothes, her left hand against Miravelle\u0027s back, her right arm holding a huge bunch of random flowers. Mona\u0027s eyes were dry and she looked cold and careworn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn remained against the door with me. Quinn held the bouquet which Mona had asked him to carry for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe perfume of the flowers filled the room. There were daisies and zinnias and lilies and roses and gladiolus, and other flowers I didn\u0027t know, lots of different colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bodies were lying on separate gurneys. The limbs looked pliant, the flesh greenish, the faces slightly sunken. Morrigan\u0027s full red hair had been brushed out as though she was lying in water. Did that make Mona think even more of Ophelia? Ash had eyelashes which were extremely long, and his fingers were long. He must have been seven feet tall. He had full black hair, almost to his shoulders, with lots of white above his ears. A beautiful mouth. Morrigan looked very much like Mona. The pair quite lovely to behold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir heads were positioned on pillows. The sheets were clean beneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wore fresh clothes, plain white cotton pants and V-neck shirts, much like the simple clothes they\u0027d been wearing when we found them, which seemed an eon ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir naked feet looked very dead. I wasn\u0027t sure why. Perhaps they were more discolored, or even a little misshapen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to see Ashlar\u0027s eyes. I wanted to know if that was possible, to lift the eyelid and see an eye. But I didn\u0027t want to speak, or to ask for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiravelle finally moved to put her right hand around Ash\u0027s face. She bent to kiss his lips. When she found they were soft, she closed her eyes, and the kiss was long and fervent. With her left hand she reached out, and Mona gave her half of the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiravelle took these and distributed them all over Ash, moving up and down, until she had partially covered him. Then Mona gave her the rest, and she finished, leaving only Ash\u0027s face. Before she withdrew, she kissed his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Morrigan who drew the sobs from her. \"Mother,\" she said. Mona, who cleaved to her, didn\u0027t say a word. But she laid her own hand on Morrigan\u0027s hand, and, finding it flexible, she curled her own fingers around Morrigan\u0027s fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn brought the flowers to Mona. Mona gave half to Miravelle. Together they laid them on the body of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorrigan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon observed everything in silence, but tears formed in his eyes. Tears wetted his cheeks. A slight frown marred his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiravelle\u0027s broken ragged sobs finally died away. Mona motioned her slowly towards the door. Then Mona looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Morrigan,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all filed out of the room and followed Rowan down a short thickly carpeted corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered a rather spectacular conference room. Michael was there, and so was Stirling, both in dark suits. That\u0027s how I was dressed, and same with Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chairs in this surprising room were genuine Chippendale, around a finely buffed oval table. The walls were a cool lavender and there were wonderful paintings on them, paintings by expressionists, full of rich and throbbing color. I wanted to steal them for my flat. The windows were open to the flickering burning night. There was a marble-top bar against the inside wall, and glittering glasses and decanters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was drinking bourbon in heavy gulps. Stirling had a glass of Scotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiravelle tried to dry her eyes but with little success. Rowan poured a small glass of sherry for her, and Miravelle laughed as she held up the delicate stem in the light, and then she sipped the sherry. She was laughing and crying at the same time very softly. Her pink nightgown looked very soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon waved away any suggestion of a drink. He stared past the assembly out into the night. He didn\u0027t bother to wipe away his tears. Only now did I notice he had cleaned his fingernails of all polish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you do with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan sat back. She considered for a long time, then she answered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you do with them if you were me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine being you,\" said Mona simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan shrugged. But her face was sad. She didn\u0027t disguise it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon spoke up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do whatever you want with them, Rowan,\" he said, with a touch of the old disdain. \"Hell, Father told Rodrigo to save the bodies for you, didn\u0027t he? It\u0027s plain enough. Rodrigo wasn\u0027t knowledgeable or reflective enough to imagine such a speech or such an intention. Father wanted something accomplished. The bodies are yours by the wish of Father. No more needs to be said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All that is very true,\" said Miravelle with a simple nod. \"Rowan, Father loved you. He really did. You do what Father wanted, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan didn\u0027t answer. She sat there staring off as was her custom and then she pressed a button under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds the door opened, and Lorkyn came into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was once more utterly shocked by this creature\u0027s appearance, not only because she was unaccompanied but because she wore the white pants and coat of a doctor, along with the name tag, stating her name as Lorkyn Mayfair, and her face was as unreadable as it had been when we first confronted each other on the Secret Isle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat kitten sweetness-small upturned nose, rosy mouth, big eyes-was, if anything, enhanced by the purity of the white clothes, and she had her hair swept up on top of her head again and pouring down her back, red as Mona\u0027s, and her eyes were just as green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her place at the table freely, across from me and from Oberon and Miravelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona stared coldly at her. And Oberon was on full alert. Miravelle merely looked at her as though she was a curiosity. Only Rowan seemed to know why she was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lorkyn who explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll say this once for you, Oberon, and Miravelle. I do not intend to be mercilessly questioned. It\u0027s my intention to be heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It better be sensational, darling,\" said Oberon bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" said Rowan. \"Please listen to what Lorkyn has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was shifting money from Rodrigo to numbered accounts for us,\" said Lorkyn. \"I was also tipping off the authorities in Miami Beach as to his activities there, getting rid of his contacts as quickly as I could. Keep in mind, I never would have had a line out or recourse to the financial info if I hadn\u0027t played the proper role for Rodrigo. I was also trying desperately to find out who Father and Mother were legally,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho owned the Secret Isle legally. But I couldn\u0027t do it. I didn\u0027t have Father\u0027s last name. Years ago, when Father first suspected trouble from Silas, he destroyed every scrap of paper that would have enabled Silas to get control of his finances. Father\u0027s lawyers came in by plane and left with everything in their briefcases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d had the names Templeton and Lost Paradise, I could have connected us to Father\u0027s lawyers in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for Rodrigo, I had no opportunity to kill him. Wherever we went there were dozens of armed men with us. That held true until the night he died, when this blond-haired archangel managed to slaughter every one of his gunsels before killing him. I never had that kind of power or advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was biding my time for it, and accumulating the money and figuring how to get both Rodrigo and his mother, and free you, Oberon, and you too Miravelle, and get clear of the island and safely to Mayfair Medical where we could find help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon was silent. It seemed that he wanted to believe Lorkyn but that he couldn\u0027t quite accept all that she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorkyn continued:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my spare time, which was plentiful, I did a great deal of research on Mayfair Medical. Since Father had told us about it, and told us about Rowan Mayfair, I wanted to know what this was all about. I wasn\u0027t going to call for help until I was sure that it was the wise thing to do. I scoured the Internet for information on Rowan Mayfair and Mayfair Medical. I read everything I could get my hands on. Nowhere could I find any real assurance that Rowan Mayfair had the power, the experience or the means to free us from Rodrigo and his crime family. It seemed to me that I had to take care of Rodrigo. And then I could get us off the island and we would contact Rowan from there. Now if you two don\u0027t believe me on this score, I have no way of proving it to you. My suggestion is you use your heads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why in Hell didn\u0027t you simply contact the authorities,\" said Oberon fiercely. \"Why didn\u0027t you E-mail the evidence you had to the Drug Enforcement Agency?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I had done that, just where do you think you would be right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger vanished from Oberon\u0027s face, yet he held her gaze steadily, then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well neither do I,\" said Lorkyn. \"Do you think they would have believed you were innocent? Do you think they would have believed the story of the Secret People? Do you think they would have locked you up as a material witness? Do you think Rodrigo\u0027s enemies couldn\u0027t have gotten to you before there was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrial?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see your point,\" he said with an air of boredom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really see it!\" she demanded. She was at her most dramatic, though still relatively low-key. \"Rowan Mayfair knows what the Taltos are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what were you looking for?\" Mona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was looking for a haven,\" said Lorkyn. \"Possibly the only haven that exists. And only after I arrived here, after I spent eight solid hours talking to Rowan, did the last of my suspicions drop away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a little too soon,\" said Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorkyn looked at Mona. Lorkyn raised her eyebrows. \"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona didn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan said nothing. She didn\u0027t even look at Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please excuse Mona,\" said Quinn quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, Lorkyn,\" I said. \"You spent eight hours straight talking to Rowan. So what gives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a place where the Taltos can stay,\" said Lorkyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, to be studied?\" said Mona. \"You\u0027re going to be put in cages in a lab. You call that a haven? The woman knocks you out with a syringe on the tarmac next to her jet plane and you place all your trust in her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorkyn stared at Mona. It was a curious moment, the tall long-necked Taltos completely bewildered by Mona\u0027s behavior. Then she drew back and went on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re misunderstanding me, Mona,\" said Lorkyn with soft confidence. \"I\u0027m talking of this place as an environment, a community, a world in which we can live and function and be protected and thrive. I myself have studied a great deal in medicine. You knew this when you went into my computer on the island. You brought the hard drive to Rowan. You gave it to her. You gave her proof of my studies. I\u0027ve given her oral proof of my studies. I want to continue my studies. I want to become a doctor. That\u0027s my wish and Rowan has accepted me as a pupil here. I\u0027ve found favor with Rowan. And there are opportunities for fruitful work here for Oberon and for Miravelle, and this is a self-contained universe in which the Taltos can be supervised without conspicuous constraints and be protected effortlessly and be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, wondrously clever,\" said Stirling. \"I never thought of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I think it\u0027s a lovely idea!\" said Miravelle. \"And we can wear nightgowns all the time, or at least I can. I love nightgowns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are, as you may know,\" Lorkyn continued, her eyes fixed hard on Mona, \"many apartments connected to this hospital, which are provided for the visiting families of the sick, and we can live in those apartments as we study here and as we work. We need never leave this compound, except when we have a preordained goal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorkyn turned her focus from Mona. She looked at Oberon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My progress was slow,\" she said, \"and my success incomplete. But Rowan has the evidence of my efforts. And Mona, you saw them. And you, Lestat, you saw them as well. Oberon, do you accept what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon was trying. I couldn\u0027t penetrate his thoughts. But I could tell by his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you never during the entire two years come to me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were Lucia\u0027s lover,\" Lorkyn said. \"I heard you howling with pleasure in the night. What was I to say to you? How did I know what you might say to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have let me know you were alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew I was alive. You saw me. Besides, my movements were circumscribed. My real freedom was on the computer. I studied. I had to find a safe place not only for us to go, but for us to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re cold,\" said Oberon disgustedly. \"You always were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" said Lorkyn, \"but now I can learn to be warm. Rowan Mayfair will teach me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s rich!\" said Mona. \"Oberon and Miravelle, you had better order your winter furs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael roused himself from his quiet reflections. \"Mona, honey, please try to trust in what we\u0027re trying to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so, Uncle Michael,\" said Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you agree, both of you?\" asked Lorkyn, looking at Oberon and Miravelle, \"that we need a haven? We cannot simply go out into the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, I don\u0027t want to go out into the world,\" said Miravelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon thought for a long moment, the fabulous eyelids lowering and then rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, of course you are. Where else but here can we discover some contraceptive that allows us to couple without hatching another immediately? Of course. It\u0027s brilliant. Very well.\" He gave one of his languid graceful shrugs. \"But do we have money from the accounts you managed to transfer?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have wealth from Father,\" said Lorkyn. \"Great wealth. The Mayfair family discovered it. That\u0027s no longer a problem. You need not feel beholden. We\u0027re quite free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, never feel beholden,\" said Rowan softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. I feel this discussion has come to an end,\" said Lorkyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose. She looked at Rowan and something silent passed between the two women, some exchange of approval and confidence and belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon rose to his feet and took Miravelle by the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, my blessed little idiot,\" he said to Miravelle, \"we\u0027ll go back to my suite and continue watchingThe Lord of the Rings. By now they\u0027ll have the white chocolate candy for us and the cold cold milk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, everyone\u0027s so good to us,\" said Miravelle, \"I love you all, I want you to know. And I\u0027m so glad all the bad men died and Rodrigo fell off the balcony. It was just the best of luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it uplifting, the way she describes it?\" asked Oberon archly. \"And to think I get to listen to this eighteen hours a day. What about you, Lorkyn? You ever going to drop in to see your brother and sister and indulge in a little intelligent discourse about your medical studies? I might go simply mad if I don\u0027t speak to someone from time to time who can use four-syllable words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Oberon,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll come to you more than you might think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came round the table and stood before him. A great relaxation came over him, and he took Lorkyn in his arms. There was an ardent kiss and a slow moving away, with reverence and a locking of thin delicate fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I am so happy,\" said Miravelle. She kissed Lorkyn on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOberon and Miravelle left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorkyn gave formal nods to all the company, gesturing for the men to take their seats again, and she too went out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room fell quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Rowan spoke: \"She\u0027s incomparably brilliant,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" I responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona sat there still for a long time, her eyes every so often engaging Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen very softly, Mona said, \"It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona stood up, and so did Quinn. Finally I did also. Michael rose out of courtesy, and Rowan remained in her chair, thoughtful, remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment it seemed Mona was going to leave without another word, but just as she reached the door, she looked back, and she said to Rowan:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll see me much anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" said Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, sweetheart,\" said Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona stopped, her head bowed. She didn\u0027t turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll never forget you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. I was caught completely off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s face crumpled as though he\u0027d been hit by a heavy blow. But he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Farewell, my beauteous mortal friends,\" I said. \"You need me, you know how to find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndescribable expression on Rowan\u0027s face as she turned and looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I realized it. It came over me slowly. It was like a chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cause that had bound us together was no more. It wasn\u0027t only Mona\u0027s turning away. We had no more reason to come to one another. No more mystery to justify our intimacy. And honor and virtue, of which I\u0027d spoken so surely, demanded we cease to interfere with one another, cease to learn about each other. We couldn\u0027t walk the same paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Taltos had been discovered, recovered and would be safe within Mayfair Medical. Lorkyn\u0027s speech had been the epilogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had to withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had I not seen it? Why had I not felt the entirety of it? Mona had known last night, and the night before, when she\u0027d stood on the island looking out to sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had not known. Not known at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and followed my companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown we went through the Sacred Mountain of Mayfair Medical in the shining glass elevator and through the wondrous lobby with its mystifying modern sculptures and richly tiled floors, out into the warm air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClem ready with the limousine door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you wanna go to that part of town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just drop us off, we\u0027re expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence in the car as we move steadily on, as if we are not with one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not Taltos. We are not innocent. We do not belong on God\u0027s Holy Mountain. We are not protected and redeemed by those whom we have served. They cannot thank us with grace, can they? They cannot open the doors of the tabernacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive us the underbelly of the city, let us spread out, where the cheapest killers come to us in the wild tangled thickets of the empty lots, ready to sink a blade for a twenty-dollar bill, and the corpses rot for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweeks in the weeds amid the charred wood and the heaps of brick, and I was ravenous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRampant moonflower, chimney stack tall as a tree, didn\u0027t they make this place for me? Whiff of evil. Crunch of broken boards. Morthadie. Cohorts behind the jagged wall. Whisper in my ear: \"Ya\u0027ll lookin for a good time?\" You couldn\u0027t have said it better. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-28.html","bookId":2596,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
