Edgy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like I’d asked the waitress for a beer, and she brought me a soda. Like I ate a sandwich when what I really wanted was a nice juicy steak. I’m full. But far from satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time, I don’t know why I feel like that. But I bet you do, don’t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do my job properly, I need books—lots of them. The laws, codes, and regulations involved in what I do are detailed and change frequently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily for me, my firm has the most extensive collection of pertinent reference materials in the city. Well, except for maybe the city library. But have you seen that place? It’s like a frigging castle. It takes forever to find out where something should be, and when you do, it’s most likely checked out already. My firm’s private library is much more convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Tuesday afternoon, I’m at my desk working with one of the aforementioned references when who should grace me with her presence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep—the lovely Kate Brooks. She is looking particularly delicious today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is hesitant. “Hey, Drew? I was looking for this year’s Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, and it’s not in the library. Do you have it by any chance?” She bites her lip in the adorable way she does whenever she’s nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book in question is actually sitting right on my desk. And I’m just about done with it. I could be the better man—the bigger person—and give it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you don’t really think I’m going to do that, do you? Have you learned nothing from our past conversations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do have it, actually,” I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles. “Oh, great. When do you think you’ll be finished with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look to the ceiling, seemingly deep in thought. “Not sure. Four…maybe five…weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weeks?” she asks, gazing down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you tell she’s annoyed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what you’re thinking. If I want to eventually—after the whole Anderson thing is over—do the horizontal tango with Kate, why don’t I try being just a little bit nicer to her? And you’re right. That does make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Anderson thing isn’t over yet. And as I’ve said before—this, my friends, is war. I’m talking DEFCON-one, gloves-off, I’ll-knock-you-down-even-if-you-are-a-girl war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wouldn’t give a bullet to a sniper who’s got his gun aimed at your forehead, would you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, Kate is too damn hot when she’s angry for me to pass up a chance to see her fired up again, just for my own twisted pleasure. I look her up and down appreciatively as I speak, before giving her my patented boyish smile that almost all women are helpless against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate, of course, not being one of those women. Figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I suppose if you ask nicely…and throw in a shoulder rub while you’re at it…I might be persuaded to give it to you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is, I would never demand anything that resembled a sexual favor in exchange for something work-related. I’m a lot of things. A bottom-feeding scumbag like that isn’t one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that last comment could definitely be construed as flat-out, old-school sexual harassment. And if Kate ever told my father I’d said that to her? Jesus H. Christ, he would fire me faster than you could say, “Up shit creek without a paddle.” Then he’d most likely knock me on my ass for good measure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m walking one high f**king tightrope here. Yet, though the possibility exists, I’m 99.9 percent sure that Kate won’t rat me out. She’s too much like me. She wants to win. She wants to beat me. And she wants to do it all on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hands on her h*ps and opens her mouth to rip into me—most likely to describe just where I can shove my book, I’d guess. I lean back with an amused smile, eagerly anticipating the explosion…that never comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilts her head to the side, closes her mouth, and says, “You know what? Never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, she walks out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of anticlimactic, don’t you think? I thought so too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later, I’m down in the library looking for an enormous reference titled Commercial and Investment Banking and the International Credit and Capital Markets. All of Harry Potter would fit into one chapter of this sucker. I scan the stacks for where it should be—but it’s not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody else must have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my attention to a much smaller, but just as important, volume called Investment Management Regulation, Seventh Edition. Only to find that it, too, is missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t believe in coincidences. I take the elevator back to the fortieth floor and march purposefully through Kate’s open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t see her right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because stacked on and around her desk, in neat skyscraper-high columns, are books. About three dozen of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I freeze, my mouth open and my eyes wide with shock. Then, inanely, I wonder how the hell she got them all up here. Kate weighs a buck-ten at best. There’s got to be several hundred pounds of pages in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s then that her shiny dark head emerges over the horizon. And, once again, she smiles. Like a cat with a mouthful of bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate cats. They’re kind of evil-looking, don’t you think? Like they’re just waiting for you to fall asleep so they can smother you with their fur or piss in your ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Drew. Did you need something?” she asks me with phony benevolence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers tap rhythmically on two gigantic hardcovers. “You know…help? Advice? Directions to the public library?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow my response. And frown at her. “No. I’m good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Okay, great. Bye-bye, now.” And with that, she disappears back down behind the literary mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooks—two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans—zip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, things get nasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m ashamed to say that both Kate and I sink to new lows in professional sabotage. It never actually wanders over to the realm of the illegal. But it’s definitely close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day I come in to find all the cables missing from my computer. It doesn’t do any lasting damage, but I have to wait an hour-and-a-half for the IT guy to show up and reconnect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Kate comes in to discover that “someone” has switched all the labels on her disks and files. Nothing was erased, mind you. But she pretty much has to look through every single one if she wants to find the documents she needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days after that at a staff meeting, I “accidentally” spill a glass of water on some information Kate has compiled for my father. Something that probably took her five or so hours to put together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oops. Sorry,” I say, letting the smirk on my face tell her how very unsorry I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine, Mr. Evans,” she assures my father as she wipes up the mess. “I have another copy in my office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow very Boy-Scoutish of her, don’t you think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater—about halfway through the same meeting—do you know what she does?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe f**king kicks me! In the shin, under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph,” I groan, and my hands fist reflexively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right, Drew?” my father asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can only nod and squeak, “Something in my throat.” I cough dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee, I’m not about to go crying to Daddy either. But sweet Christ it hurt. You ever been kicked in the shin by a four-inch pointy shoe? For a man, there is only one area that’s more painful to be kicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is a place that dare not speak its name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the throbbing in my leg dies down a bit, I hide my hand behind some upturned papers while my father’s speaking. Then I flip Kate the finger. Immature, I know, but apparently we’re now both functioning at the preschool level, so I’m guessing it’s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate sneers at me. Then she mouths, You wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell—she’s got me there, now doesn’t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re in the home stretch. A month of mortal combat has passed, and tomorrow is my father’s deadline. It’s around eleven o’clock, and Kate and I are the only ones left in the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve had this fantasy a hundred times. Though, I have to say, it’s never included us in our respective offices, glaring at each other across the hallway—accompanied by the occasional obscene hand gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over and see her reviewing her charts. What is she thinking? Is this the Stone Age? Who the hell uses poster board anymore? Anderson is definitely mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m just putting the finishing touches on my own impressive PowerPoint presentation when Matthew walks into my office. He’s heading to the bars. Never mind that it’s a Wednesday night; that’s just Matthew. A few short weeks ago, that was me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me for the longest time, saying nothing. Then he sits on the edge of my desk and says, “Dude, just f**king do it already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?” I ask, my fingers never pausing over the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you looked at yourself lately? You need to just walk over there and get it done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he’s annoying me. “Matthew, what the hell are you trying to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all he comes back with is, “You ever see War of the Roses? Is that how you want to end up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have work to do. I don’t have time for this right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe throws his hands up. “Fine. I tried. When we find you two in the lobby under the fallen chandelier, I’ll tell your mother I frigging tried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop typing. “What the f**k do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean you and Kate. It’s obvious you have a thing for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over at her office when he says her name. She doesn’t look up. “Yeah, I do have ‘a thing’ for her. An extreme dislike of her. We can’t stand each other. She’s a pill. I wouldn’t f**k her with a ten-foot dildo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that’s not true. I’d so f**k her. But I wouldn’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah—you’re right. That’s not true either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew sits in the chair across from my desk. I can feel him staring at me again. Then he sighs. And says, like it’s supposed to be some awe-inspiring revelation, “Sally Jansen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sally Jansen,” he says again, then clarifies, “Third grade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture of a small girl with light brown pigtails and thick glasses comes to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “What about her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was the first girl I ever loved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t you used to call her Smelly Sally?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” He nods solemnly. “Yes, I did. And I loved her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t you get, like, the entire third grade to call her Smelly Sally?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods again and, trying to sound sage, says, “Love makes you do some stupid shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess so, because…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t she have to leave early twice a week to go to a therapist because you ragged on her so much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ponders this a moment. “Yes, that’s true. You know, there’s a fine line between love and hate, Drew.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tangled-tangled-1/page-7.html","bookId":1849,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:17 PM"}
