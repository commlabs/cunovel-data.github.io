Blue, long-keeled, and low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder no one dares come here, Monk thought. Dead men tell no tales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk glanced around him as some men hurried past, shouting in Malay. He strained to make out the words. He checked his watch. Where was Jessie? A little translation right about now would be handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk studied the island ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom international reports, the Indonesian islands were riddled with hundreds of secret coves. Over eighteen thousand islands made up the Indonesian chain; only six thousand were known to be populated. That still left twelve thousand places to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk watched the trio of boats buzz toward them, then split away, spinning sharply with a spray of seawater. They positioned themselves to either side of the cruise ship\u0027s bow and one directly in front. They headed back toward the island, puttering slowly in the chop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEscorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smaller ships were guiding their big brother to port.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the island drew nearer, Monk was able to spot a narrow chasm in the cliff face, angled in such a manner as to be easy to miss. The gap appeared too small for the cruise ship, like passing a camel through a needle\u0027s eye. But someone had done proper soundings, compared them to the ship\u0027s dimensions and draft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cruise ship pushed its bow between two sheer walls of black rock. The rest of the ship had no choice but to follow. The port side scraped with a screech and tremble. Monk danced back as a spar of cliff on his side ground away a pair of lifeboats, smashing and raining down pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire ship squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk held his breath. But they did not have far to go. The way opened again. The Mistress of the Seas slid out of the chasm and into a wide, open-air lagoon, the size of a small lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk crossed back to the rail and gaped around. I\u0027ll be damned. No wonder they call this place a navel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe island was really an old volcanic cone with a large lagoon at the center. Jagged walls circled all around and made up the crown of the island. Inside, the cliffs were less steep, lush with jungles, threaded with silver waterfalls, and lined by sandy beaches. The far side of the wide lagoon was littered with palm-thatched buildings and clapboard homes. Scores of wooden docks and stone jetties prickled from the small town. Several boats were pulled up on shore for repair; others were rusted down to ribbings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome sweet home for the pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore boats sped out to meet the arriving cruise ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk expected they weren\u0027t coming to sell trinkets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe searched upward, noting how the character of the light had grown shadowy when they had pushed into the lagoon. As if the storm clouds had blown over suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t clouds that shaded the lagoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone\u0027s been busy, Monk thought as he craned upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrisscrossed over the open cone of the volcano, a vast net had been strung. It looked fairly patchwork, built piecemeal, surely decades in its construction, possible centuries. While the main sections were supported with steel cable and latticework, strung from one peak to the next, other areas were formed of rope and reef nets, and even older sections appeared to be merely twined grass and thatch. The entire construct spanned the lagoon like a meshed roof, an engineering marvel, artfully camouflaged with leaf, vine, and branch. From above, the lagoon would be invisible. From the air, the island would appear to be just a continuous jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the vast net had captured the Mistress of the Seas and hid it forever from prying eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engines cut and the ship slowed to a drift. Monk heard the chug and gentle vibration as the ship\u0027s anchors were dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA commotion toward the bow drew his attention forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk headed over to investigate. Other pirates were less stealthy and ran past him, assault rifles held in the air, cheering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can\u0027t be good.\" Monk muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping back, Monk discovered a large crowd of the pirates gathered on the forward deck, massed around the pool and hot tub. Bahamian music blasted, courtesy of Bob Marley and his Rastafarian riffs. Many had bottles of beer, whiskey, and vodka, reflective of the mix of mercenary and local pirate. It seemed a welcome-home party was under way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirates\u0027 attention focused toward the starboard side of the ship. Assault rifles were shaken in upraised fists; encouraging shouts rang out. Someone had unscrewed the diving board and had it protruding out from the rail, over the water. A man was dragged forward, his arms tied behind his back. He had been beaten, bloody-nosed, split lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoved around, Monk caught a glimpse of his face over the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie babbled desperately in Malayâ€”but his words fell on deaf ears. He was forced at gunpoint over the rail and onto the diving board. It seemed these were fundamentalist pirates, sticking with tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie teetered on the plank, poked and prodded to the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk made a step in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a mass of pirates stood between him and the young nurse. And what could he do? Plainly Monk could not shoot his way through the throng of pirates here. It would just get them both killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Monk\u0027s hand drifted to his rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should never have involved the kid. He\u0027d come to lean too heavily on him, pushed him too far. Jessie had left an hour ago, searching for any local maps of the region. Someone must have a map or could sketch one. The pirates had to be getting their supplies from somewhere nearby. Monk had urged caution, but Jessie had scampered away, eyes bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd look what it bought him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a final wail, Jessie fell from the plank\u0027s end and tumbled into the water, striking it hard. Monk rushed to the rail, along with most of the pirates, standing shoulder to shoulder as they catcalled, cheered, and cursed. Bets were placed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk let out a held breath when Jessie resurfaced, kicking hard, on his back, gasping. A pair of pirates near the bow leveled rifles at the struggling victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShots cracked crisp, especially loud under the muffle of the netting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpats of splashes marked the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Jessie\u0027s heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid kicked harder and writhed, swimming away from the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would never make it to shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the blue speedboats aimed straight toward his floundering shape, meaning to run him over. But at the last moment, it dodged away, swamping Jessie with its the wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sputtered up, looking more angry than frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his back, he scissor-kicked and used his bound arms as some sort of rudder. The guy was strong and wiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the speedboat was faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt swung around again, sweeping back for another pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA laughing gunman in the back of the boat braced himself and aimed his assault rifle. He strafed the water as the boat passed between the cruise ship and the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk cringed, knowing Jessie could not have survived this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speedboat buzzed past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there Jessie was, coughing and sputtering. He paddled and kicked. A small cheer arose from the pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk\u0027s hands clenched on the rail, hard enough to rip it away. Goddamn assholes were toying with Jessie, stretching out the torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he was unable to act, refusing to turn away, Monk\u0027s fingers tightened into a knot. His face, heated to a red-hot fire, must be glowing through the nut-brown makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my fault. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie fought toward shore, on his side now, searching for how far he had to swim to reach the beach. The speedboat circled back. Laughter echoed over the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie kicked faster. Suddenly he popped up, finding sand under his toes. He ran, fell, shoved, and dove toward shore. Then his legs were high-stepping through the lapping water. He pounded across the beach toward the dense jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo, Jessie . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speedboat raced by. Shots were fired. Sand exploded, leaves shredded. Then Jessie dashed the last steps and vanished headlong into the forest, arms still tied behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore cheers, some disappointed groans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoney changed hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut most were still chuckling, as if at some private joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk nudged his neighbor. \"Apa?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the band of pirates here was a mix of locals and foreign mercenaries, Monk had learned that pigeon Malay passed okay. Not everyone was as fluent as the native pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gentleman at his side was missing several teeth, but was happy to show how many he had left by grinning broadly. He pointed toward shore, but he aimed higher up. A few wisps of smoke could be seen near the ridgeline. Some camp was up there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pemakan daging manusia,\" the pirate explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame to you, bud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirate must have noted his confusion and only smiled wider, showing his decaying wisdom teeth. He tried again. \"Kanibals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk\u0027s eyes widened. That was one Malay word Monk could translate himself. He stared back toward the empty beach, then up toward the trails of smoke. It seemed the pirates shared the island with a local tribe of cannibals. And like any good guests returning home, the pirates had thrown their caretakers a bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiterally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirate at his side continued to babble and pointed toward the water. Monk only caught a few phrases, a word here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". .. lucky... at night. . . bad . . .\" The man pantomimed with his hand, a claw rising up and grabbing something and dragging it down. \"Mis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last was a Malay curse word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk had heard it enough times, but he was fairly certain the man was using its direct translation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raksasa iblis,\" he repeated, and babbled a bit more, ending in a whispered name, drying his grin into more of an ache. \"Rangda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk frowned and straightened, leaning over a bit to stare at the water. He remembered Jessie\u0027s old wives\u0027 tale. Rangda was the name of the Balinese witch queen, whose demons were supposed to haunt these waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At night. . .\" the man mumbled in Malay, and pointed to the water. \"Amat, amat buruk.\"Very, very bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk sighed. Just great. He stared with concern toward the forest, toward where Jessie had vanished. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-35.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
