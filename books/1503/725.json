When I learned I had six Elemental Attributes, I had been thinking all along, how I could use the power of my six attributes and unleash them to maximum effect. As such, I went through various different experiments, trying out many things. At last, not long ago, when I broke through the six-Jeweled stage, through some coincidence and luck, I created this formation. The profound secret behind this Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation is in imitation and guiding. It is able to guide the atmospheric energies in the air to greatly increase my recovery speed of Heavenly Energy, allowing my fighting capabilities to be greatly extended and sustained. Furthermore, with this Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, I am able to imitate any Skills of my attributes which are at six-star rated and below. However, I have only just created it, so I will still need a lot more time to properly work it out and use it properly. However, I believe that as my cultivation increases, its power will only improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSelf-creation?
