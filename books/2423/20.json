She seemed to be examining Mallory like an exhibit, a piece she\u0027d added to her freak collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way was Mallory going to have that lady as her counselor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To the wall, Zedman!” Leyland shouted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Hunter stopped talking to his guest. If he stepped in, it was all over. Mallory would be forced to obey, bent into any damn G.I. Joe position Hunter wanted, and—if Mallory didn\u0027t get another slap in the face like seeing Olsen—Mallory might even grow to accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d been concerned with Morrison, felt good that the fat slob had gotten over the stupid wall. Mallory realized she\u0027d been on the verge of giving in to the program, of cooperating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Olsen again, she had a target for her anger. Mallory remembered the plane trip—how Chadwick had reassured her, treated her with firmness but respect, which had somehow been a worse trick, a worse lie than if he\u0027d treated Mallory like these bastard instructors did. Chadwick had tricked her into thinking that Cold Springs wouldn\u0027t be so bad. Chadwick had manipulated Mallory\u0027s mother into sending her here—Mallory\u0027s mother, who\u0027d always liked Chadwick, who\u0027d shown him more affection than she\u0027d ever shown Mallory. Chadwick had probably sent Olsen here to keep an eye on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zedman!” Leyland yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter\u0027s guest asked him something too quiet to hear, and Hunter answered, “Watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory took a step forward, then another, her whole body trembling. She would not be an exhibit. She would not play their game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the boys, Bridges or Smart, yelled, “Zedman, get back here!” They knew Mallory was about to earn them extra hours of drill time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ll make good white levels one of these days, Mallory thought, but not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped toward Olsen. “You did this to me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drill instructors were still yelling, but out of the corner of her eye she could see the enforcer, the staff member with the body bag who was always on the periphery, ready to move as fast as the Grim Reaper whenever things got out of hand. The bag was for Mallory. The whole force of the camp would come down on her if she didn\u0027t obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mallory couldn\u0027t. She had remembered herself now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you!” she shouted at Olsen. “Tell Chadwick—tell him I\u0027m glad Katherine\u0027s dead. Tell him I said that! You tell him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white level pinned her arms, held her back while the guy with the body bag came forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated that she was crying, but she couldn\u0027t stop it. If they put her into that bag, she would find a way to kill herself. She would never run their damn obstacle course again. She\u0027d die if she spent another day in solitary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory kicked as they fastened her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You lied!” she screamed at Olsen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory\u0027s only satisfaction was the sadness in her eyes, as if Mallory had really damaged her. But on second thought, Mallory wasn\u0027t sure if that look in Olsen\u0027s eyes was new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gag went over Mallory\u0027s mouth, the enforcer and the white level dragging her toward the cinder block shed under the cypress tree, where she would be spending more time in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whistle blew. The course resumed without her. And Hunter and his guest went back to their conversation, Hunter gesturing toward Mallory as if she\u0027d just provided a testimonial for the program he was trying to sell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma\u0027s house on Telegraph Hill was a peeling wedge of white stucco, like a slice of bride\u0027s cake, scrupulously preserved until it had petrified into something inedible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t always thought of it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears ago, fresh from her first big commission, she\u0027d loved the house John had found for her. It was spacious, clean, quiet, secure—everything the townhouse in the Mission had not been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, she dreaded coming home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent the afternoon at Laurel Heights, working with Ann and the school board and David Kraft—Katherine\u0027s old friend, her first boyfriend. Norma sat in meetings about rebuilding the school, gave updates on the fund-raising, and every time David smiled, she thought about her daughter—how she had never graduated, never gone to college or had a job. Then Norma drove home to her beautiful empty house, her ears still ringing with the sounds of children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was torturing herself needlessly. She knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wanted to help Ann. She found herself neglecting her paying accounts, spending way too much time on the pro bono work for Laurel Heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever she talked it over with John—who still knew more about the school\u0027s finances than she did, had set up all the accounts—he seemed mystified by her commitment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all people, John said, you should be rooting for her to fail. What has she not taken away from you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma understood what was on the line for Ann. She\u0027d seen it in the faces of the board members—Ann was in trouble. Families were worried about the school\u0027s dilapidated facilities, the program that seemed stuck back in the late 1970s when Ann had seized the helm, and the amount of time it had taken Ann to meet her capital campaign goals. Parents had heard about Mallory\u0027s problems, the weapon that had been found on campus—and they wondered uneasily if it wouldn\u0027t just be easier to move their kids elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Ann\u0027s building program finally succeeded, she might turn things around, head the school until she retired, leave a permanent legacy. Otherwise, she had given her entire professional life to Laurel Heights. What would she have to show?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma also had less altruistic reasons for helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she thought about jackhammers breaking up the playground, bulldozers plowing a muddy path up the side of the hill, trampling the azaleas and hydrangeas that had been there for eighty years—she felt a dark satisfaction, the same satisfaction she felt sitting up at night, in her bathroom, counting sleeping pills in her palm, wishing she possessed her daughter\u0027s courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t end her life. It wasn\u0027t in her nature. But she could bury her memories of Laurel Heights—raze the place that had gobbled up all of her ex-husband\u0027s time, ruined her marriage, failed Katherine so miserably. She could help replace it with something clean and huge, empty of history, just like her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started to rain as she turned on Greenwich. Red-faced tourists huffed up the hill, their cameras wrapped in plastic bags, Bay Guardian newspapers wilting over their heads. The Rastafarian flower seller who sometimes gave Norma free roses was hastily loading bouquets from the sidewalk into his van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she saw the black BMW in front of her house, her heart developed a caffeine flutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled into the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn came out her front door, smiling into her headlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shouldn\u0027t have been surprised. John and Ann both had keys. Mallory, too—for that matter. Hadn\u0027t she made it clear to all of them—this was their home as well as hers? She wanted them in her life. She wanted to be neutral ground, a conduit through which they could interact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd today was Wednesday—her night for dinner with John. But that shouldn\u0027t have been until later, and they usually met at a restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what was he doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Pérez didn\u0027t seem to be with him. That\u0027s one thing she had put her foot down about—John was never to bring that man to her home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez scared her on some instinctive level. She knew he was Mexican, but his military bearing, his cruel eyes, brought back too many childhood nightmares, stories her grandfather would tell her about Castro\u0027s soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her satchel out of the car, tossed it to John. “You were cleaning house for me, I hope?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the smile, he looked tired, angry, as if he\u0027d just gotten through yelling at someone. “Like you need housecleaning. Five years, Ms. Reyes—when are you going to move in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe punched his arm. “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come and see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, candles on the dining table. A takeout Chinese dinner—white paper boxes, chopsticks, an uncorked bottle of Chardonnay. The doors of the back deck were open on the rainy evening. The Bay glowed below, the soft neon of the city illuminating the wake of the Sausalito ferry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic was playing—not John\u0027s favorite classical. He knew that would remind her too much of Chadwick. He\u0027d picked Los Lobos, La Pistola y el Corazón—music she\u0027d once daydreamed to. She must have told John she loved this album. She should have been flattered he remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the music brought back memories of the bougainvillea out her old kitchen window, Katherine playing in the backyard, Chadwick grading papers at the yellow Formica table, massaging her ankle with his toes. She swallowed back her sadness. “I hope we\u0027re talking Szechwan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only four-pepper items.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ay, qué buena. What\u0027s the occasion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out her chair, poured her some wine. Only after she\u0027d sat, allowed him to serve her some chicken and peanuts, did he say, “I\u0027m apologizing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mallory being taken away. You knew. You didn\u0027t tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma felt heat collecting in her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s okay,” John said. “I was mad all week. Then I realized—Ann put you in a hell of a position. You couldn\u0027t betray her confidence. Wouldn\u0027t be fair of me to expect that, would it? Just promise—if I ever put you in a bind like that, force you to choose between us, you\u0027ll tell me. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma took a shaky breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething bothered her. Behind the diplomatic, carefully rehearsed words, John seemed . . . hungry. Grasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry,” she said. “If it helps, I told her she was crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mallory\u0027s my child, too. Yet I\u0027m allowed no say in this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile seemed dangerously thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma thought about the night of the auction, John and Chadwick sparring drunk in the school playground—how ridiculous they\u0027d looked. It never would\u0027ve occurred to her to be scared of John Zedman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, she\u0027d never been scared of anything with Chadwick. As mild-mannered as he was—come on, you\u0027d have to be nuts to challenge a guy that big. That feeling of safety, of immunity from danger—she\u0027d taken it totally for granted until she became single again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, alone with John, she felt a little shiver of fear up her spine, even though she knew that was absurd. The guy was one of her oldest friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe speared a chunk of chicken, nudged the fleck of red pepper off it. The food was too spicy even for her. It wasn\u0027t much of a meal, or an apology. More like a gourmet punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you forgave me,” she told John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do. I\u0027m just wondering—you know. You let her call Chadwick? I mean—what was that . . . temporary insanity, Norma?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her napkin, got up from the table, picked up her plate. “Thank you for dinner, John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa. I\u0027m just trying to sort through things. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t lay a guilt trip on me. I\u0027m not—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re not Ann,” he finished for her. “I know that, Norma. God, I can see that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the kitchen counter, set her plate down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” he coaxed. “Finish eating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poured her wine into the sink, froze when she felt John\u0027s breath on her shoulder. “What was it like—” he asked, “seeing Chadwick again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-20.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM"}
