Usually by the time she got to the playground, there were no good balls left, but she could see one red ball by Louis\u0027s foot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She knocked over a kid from the tenth floor and shouted, \"Hey, Lou-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly she stopped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had just remembered where she\u0027d heard of Mrs. Drazil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was from Louis! He had once told her about the meanest teacher he\u0027d ever had when he was a kid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She hurried over to her friends to make sure. \"Hey, Todd!\" she called.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd was playing tetherball with Ron. As he turned to look at Deedee, the ball came around and bonked him on the head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you remember when Louis told us about the meanest teacher he ever had?\" asked Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd shook his head. After being conked by the tetherball, he couldn\u0027t remember anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I remember,\" said Jason, who was in line to play. \"Whenever Louis got in trouble, the teacher used to put the wastepaper basket on his head!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s right!\" said Jenny. \"And then Louis would have to keep it there the rest of the day. And everyone would laugh at him. And then the teacher would call on him to answer questions from the blackboard, but he couldn\u0027t see the questions, so she\u0027d give him an F!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you remember the teacher\u0027s name?\" asked Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e 84\n\u003cbr\u003e Her friends shook their heads. Todd couldn\u0027t even remember his own name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think it was Mrs. Drazil,\" said Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They ran to Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Louis!\" said Jason. \"What was the name of that mean teacher you once had when you were a kid?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which one?\" asked Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The one that put the trash can on your head,\" said Jenny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis shuddered just thinking about her. \"Mrs. Drazil,\" he whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The kids looked at each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What color hair did she have?\" asked Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Brown,\" said Louis. \"Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We have a substitute teacher,\" explained Deedee. \"She\u0027s real nice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Her name is Mrs. Drazil,\" said Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Whoa, I\u0027m getting out of here,\" said Louis. He started to run, but the kids grabbed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s okay,\" said Jenny. \"It can\u0027t be the same teacher.
