I needed to tell him about our no-sex house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down the dark hall to the bathroom. Girls were in a huge lineup. I stood at the back of it for a second, but a door opened at the end of the hall. Gerry walked out, getting mauled by the girls. He pointed at me, “Hey! Help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed watching them attack. Had they never noticed? Seriously, he was on our team. The lineup thinned out; I smiled at him, “No way, you’re on your own, but thanks for clearing a path to the bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look. I budged ahead and slipped into the bathroom. I finished and washed my hands. Gerry must have been in the hallway still. The bathroom was dead. I looked at myself, wincing. I was a hot mess. My curly hair was huge and my face was red and sweaty. Whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way back to the table, but Danny nodded at me and pointed at the stage. In the dark corner I saw Lochlan. He waved at me, trying not to get attention from anyone. I walked over that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to leave through the back. It’s too nuts now,” he shouted at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and looked around, “I’ll meet you at the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “No way, princess.” He put a hand out. I heard girls shouting behind me, over top of the DJ music. I looked back as they rushed us. I grabbed his hand and let him pull me up. He dragged me to the back of the stage and through an open black, metal door. He closed it, pressing his back against it. Hands started banging on it within seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up into his eyes, “They’re like a zombie movie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were alone in the dark hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pounding of the crazed fans, matched my beating heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth hung open, like I wanted to say something but I couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing I wanted to say would have broken our deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop looking at me like that,” he pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I’m not looking at you like anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed me against the wall behind me, pressing my back against it, “You are. I saw you in the crowd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “You’re magnificent.” The words were a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled with something and I could see it in his eyes when he lost the fight. He lowered his face, pressing his lips against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the moment when the lights came on, on the stage. It was explosions of sound and light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis soft lips against mine was overwhelming. His hands ran down my body, tracing my bare arms gently. I shuddered but let it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, like it was a second explosion of lights and sounds, I joined in. I wrapped my arms around him, pulling him down on me. He moaned into my mouth as his tongue caressed mine. His hands cupped my ass, lifting me up into his arms. He smelled like sweat and tasted like beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my legs around his waist as he held me to the wall. His body pressed against mine was exactly how I’d fantasized. His lips were softer than I imagined. He kissed like he’d majored in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back, letting me stand on my own and backed up away from me. “Oh shit. Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “It’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t speak. We breathed and tried to comprehend what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had really crossed the line this time. I didn’t want to stop but he had shut it off. I could see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a mistake. I’m sorry.” His words burned, but at least they had the decency to kill the savage lust tearing through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I agree.” I opened the door again, letting the screaming fans in, “See you at the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t hear me. He didn’t stand a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwkward as ass\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny poked me again with his fork, “Stop scowling. You look moody as shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him the death stare. He knew it meant fuck off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry handed me a Danish. I tore a bite out and drank some coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just tell him you like him too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Gerry with a confused look, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Mike and Lochlan signing the breasts of the girls on the street outside the café.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who Mike?” I asked cheekily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked me, “You’re being difficult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a look similar to the one Danny had gotten, before he walked off to see the breasts. “He is signing the tits of a chick on the side of the road in Salem. That isn’t boyfriend material.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry snickered, “It’s all part of the show. You and I both know, that’s not him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “If you like him so much, you ask him out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a heartbroken look, “Honey, I would but he doesn’t swing that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dawned on me then, that Gerry wanted to live vicariously through me. He liked Lochlan. I looked at Lochlan and nodded. What wasn’t there to like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry nudged me, his face had turned serious, “You know he’s the big ticket item, musicians like us need. The spark in him is huge; he could light the whole world on fire with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward, “You could consider dating him and keeping him calm. I have noticed you keep him calm and relaxed. People like him are prone to emotional outbursts and addictions. They’re larger than life and their personalities are bigger than their bodies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “You want me to consider dating him to help Thin Ice out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, “We both know you like him, and if he loses it like he did before, he could ruin his whole career. Divas don’t get to have tantrums in the beginning. They have to earn their right to be a crazy artist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say anything else. If I dated him, it wouldn’t be for that reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry got up and left my side, and Mike took the chance to come over and sit beside me, “So, are you and Lochlan dating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “Not a chance, roommates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seeing anyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “No. I’m busy with school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna go on a date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “Thank you, but no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, “You have to eat, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?” It was starting to get awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, “We could just go have a meal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at his lips as he spoke and nodded, “I guess.” It was a petty whorish thing to do, stare at the thing I couldn’t have, and say sure to someone I didn’t really want. I instantly shook my head, “Actually, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked confused, “Which is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would go for a meal with you, but only as friends. I don’t want to be the girl who broke up Thin Ice because I dated the bass player and lived with the lead singer. Then me and the bass player broke up and the lead singer took my side. Or worse, took your side and I ended up homeless. You know what I’m saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, looking a bit down, “Yeah, I guess. I can ask him, if you want and see if he thinks it’s awkward for us to eat a meal together. We can go as friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed, “Okay. If he doesn’t think it’s awkward, I’d love to go for dinner, even as a group.” I knew Lochlan would say no. It would be easier to let Mike down with Lochlan telling him no way, than me doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face lit up. He stood and walked over to Lochlan as the group of girls left. The two of them talked. I tried not to watch as Lochlan’s cheeks flushed and his eyes flicked to me. Mike put his hands in the air defensively. Gerry gave me an evil look. I gave it right back to him. Danny started laughing. Whatever was happening in the powwow of doom, I assumed was bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan stalked over, “Not funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, “It was nice of him to ask me out for dinner. I told him it would be awkward, since I’m your roommate. It could end badly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see he was fighting his anger. “What about last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a bite of my Danish, “You said it was a mistake. I agreed. Did something else happen, I wasn’t aware of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat in the seat, “Why are you playing these games with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? Games with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, taking my Danish and having a bite. I snatched it back and got up. I walked away from the group of them, and headed to a magic store in an old building down the road. I had spotted it when we had been doing our tour. The door tinkled from the bell attached to it, as I entered. An old lady in a cool old-fashioned dress with long, gray hair smiled at me. I was about to say hello when Lochlan entered after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneered at him and looked back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed at my pastry, “You can’t have food in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to ask for a garbage can, but Lochlan grabbed my hand and lifted the pastry to his face. He ate it from my fingers. I made the weird noise I seemed to make with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked my fingers, which I enjoyed more than I was willing to tell him. I contemplated the mace in my pocket, but he pulled me down a crowded aisle. The smell of herbs and candles were everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down on me, running his hands down my cheeks, “You can’t date anyone, ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “What? Are you high? What was in that Danish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes didn’t have any humor in them, he stroked his thumb across my bottom lip. He replaced it with his mouth, sucking my lip into his mouth. We both tasted like pastry. The kiss was slow and intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to date me,” he whispered into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “But we live together. You were right. Think how intense that would be? Roommates dating is too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed, “I want you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip for fear I would return what he’d said, or up the ante and say something so much worse, “You said kissing me was a mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “I meant kissing you behind the stage with groupies everywhere, like we’re hiding in a corner, was a mistake. I won’t ever treat you like you’re just some girl.” He kissed me again, “Go out for dinner with me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/my-side/page-14.html","bookId":2792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM"}
