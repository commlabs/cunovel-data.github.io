{"id":94807,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eI was naked and dripping wet from the shower when I heard a familiar banging on my bathroom window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamnit, Peach,\" I muttered, then pulled my fluffy pink polka-dot robe around me and yanked up the blinds just in time to see her pulling her headless broom handle back across the tiny gap between our houses and back into her bathroom. I threw the window open and sat on the radiator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not twelve anymore, Peach,\" I said. \"You can call me on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned her elbows on the sill of her open window. \"Have you talked to Millie lately? Oh, and I\u0027m out of conditioner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute.\" I reached under my bathroom sink and pulled out the small bag full of hotel toiletries I kept there. I pulled out a little bottle of conditioner and tossed it across the six feet between us; she caught it handily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t talked to Millie,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve been a little distracted since the Confessional. You haven\u0027t talked to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"And Nick said she hasn\u0027t shown up for work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s missed three days of work? Why would she...?\" I shot Peach a look. \"You didn\u0027t tell him, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeach gave me an indignant look. \"About her being in love with him? No! What kind of friend do you think I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared her down for a moment, and she deflated a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine, yes, I told him. He\u0027s going to be my husband. We share everything. But I told him not to say anything to her, and he didn\u0027t, I swear. He didn\u0027t get the chance.\" She nibbled her lip. \"I\u0027ve left, like, ten messages on her phone. She hasn\u0027t called me back. Have you tried to call her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, feeling a twinge of guilt. I\u0027d been so wrapped up in my own drama with Tobias that I hadn\u0027t thought much about Millie. Not that there was much real drama with Tobias at the moment; hard to have a lot of drama when you\u0027re pretending the other person doesn\u0027t exist. I\u0027d also used a fair amount of mental energy rationalizing the trash-can-lid dog - tequila causes hallucinations, right? - so I just hadn\u0027t had much left to worry about Millie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried,\" Peach said. \"Maybe we should go by her house later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed a towel off the rack and scrunched my dripping hair in it. \"Good idea. All right, I\u0027m going to go dry my - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you come over?\" she said. \"We can go to CCB\u0027s for waffles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve given up waffles. Just until I get the pudge off. Do you know how many calories are in those things? I think I get contact fat just from serving them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged; Peach had never had to think about calories a day in her life. \"Have you talked to Stacy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt myself stiffen at the mention of her name. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeach gave me a sharp look. \"You should cut her some slack on that whole thing. It was a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a stab go through me, and I toweled my hair with a little too much vehemence as I said, \"It doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s over. I\u0027m not upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, whatever you say. But she didn\u0027t know how you felt about Tobias back then, and she feels really bad about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped rubbing the towel against my head and stared at Peach. \"Oh, please. She does not. Stacy has never felt bad for anything she\u0027s done, ever.\" I continued toweling my hair, then stopped again. \"And it doesn\u0027t matter anyway, because Tobias is a grown man who can do what he wants. Neither one of them owes me anything. There\u0027s nothing to feel bad about.\" I pulled the towel away from my head. My scalp was starting to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at any rate, you can\u0027t go to Europe now,\" she said carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my head to look at her. \"Oh, no? And why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me. \"The whole group is falling apart. Millie\u0027s upset and none of us know what\u0027s happened to her. You and Stacy are fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not fighting,\" I said through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Millie\u0027s grandmother is dead. Your mom is dead. My parents are in Florida so they might as well be dead. And Stacy\u0027s mom is a nutcase. We\u0027re the only family we all have. You\u0027re going to just leave and let that fall apart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes at her. \"Is that what this is about? Are you manufacturing drama to keep me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting married,\" Peach said, her lower lip quivering. \"Are you even going to be here for my wedding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, I\u0027ll be here for your wedding,\" I said. \"They have airports in Europe, you know. Have you picked a date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeach straightened up and stared at me, delivering her statement like a blow. \"December twentieth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. That\u0027s fast. But ... sure. Okay. I\u0027ll be back for the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth dropped open. \"Back? You can\u0027t go and come back. Who\u0027s going to help me plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ticked off my fingers. \"Nick. Stacy. Millie. A thousand wedding planners in the regional phone book. And your parents are in Florida, Peach. They\u0027re not dead. You\u0027ve got people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you. I can\u0027t put on a wedding without you, you\u0027re my oldest friend. You\u0027re the closest thing I have to a sister. You have to stay here until I get married, and then it\u0027s the holidays, and you can\u0027t go then. January and February are too cold, and it\u0027s even worse in Scotland in the winter. We can talk about it again in April.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought my ticket,\" I said. \"I leave in August.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a refund.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nonrefundable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand why you have to leave all of a sudden like that. It doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just...\" I thought about explaining it to her, invoking memories of my mother, who used to sit in her garden staring into space for hours. I know he left her on October fifth only because she spent that day crying in her room every year. But I couldn\u0027t tell Peach all this because she wouldn\u0027t allow me to leave her because of a man. Peach was great in a lot of ways, but she would never understand what unrequited love did to you. No one had ever turned Peach down in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just something I need to do, Peach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t understand why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huffed in frustration. \"You don\u0027t have to. We\u0027re not family, Peach. We\u0027re neighbors. So just back off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately after I said it, I wanted to take it back, but I couldn\u0027t. Silence edged into the space between us as Peach stared down at the ground below, quickly swiping tears away from her cheeks before raising her head to look at me once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only going to get married once, Liv. Europe will always be there.\" And with that, she closed her window and left her bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat with the bag of toiletries on my lap, just staring until all the products melded together in a blurred lump in my vision. Peach would come around and apologize later. Millie would be fine, we\u0027d all see to that, and Stacy and I would iron over whatever was tense between us. Tobias and I were already getting back to normal, kind of. The chances were good that by the time I got on that plane, Peach would accept it, too. It was about as likely as a winged unicorn flying over my house and pooping rainbows, but there was a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, though, I was too tired to think about it, so I stuffed the toiletry bag under my bathroom sink and went to take a nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little after seven at night when I woke up, although with the sun being out so late in the summer, it took me a moment to realize it was still Wednesday, my day off. I lay back in my bed and stared at the ceiling, wrist resting on my forehead. I supposed I could eat, but it was hard to work up any enthusiasm for it. Really, the only thing I had enough energy to do was go back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I\u0027d closed my eyes, I heard it. A sound, downstairs. A door opening. I shot up in bed and my heart raced as I tried to remember ... hadn\u0027t I locked the door? Not that anyone in this neighborhood needed to lock their doors with Peach and Ginny Boyle around, but still ... I thought I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crap,\" I said, trying to decide what to do. Maybe whoever it was would just steal my television and leave me in peace. I really didn\u0027t care; it was an old TV, and it\u0027d save me the trouble of selling it. I closed my eyes and tried to convince myself it was my imagination, but then I heard more shuffling downstairs and figured I had to at least check it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my pink softball bat and walked down the stairs; when I got to the foyer at the bottom, I heard a sound in the kitchen, and relaxed a bit as I realized it was probably just Peach. We\u0027d traded house keys years ago, and she had no boundaries. It would be just like her to let herself in if she needed sugar or eggs or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peach?\" I called out, still holding the bat in my hands, but a little lowered. \"Is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen door flew open and Davina stepped out, her bright peacock-colored skirt whirling around her. I screamed. Davina threw up her arms and screamed, too, spilling a bit of her drink on the floor. She took a breath and raised one hand to the wall to steady herself as she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, baby, you scared the hell out of me.\" She looked down at the floor and said, \"Crap, I spilled,\" and then flew through the kitchen door, leaving it swinging in a wake of blue silk and lilac scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in my foyer for another minute or so. I realized my mouth was hanging open and I shut it. Adrenaline shot through my body on every hard pump of my raging heart, and I went into the kitchen, where I saw Davina placing a second glass of scotch down on my tiny linoleum table, presumably for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" she said, grabbing a sponge off the sink. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disappeared, humming an unfamiliar song as she cleaned up the spill on the other side of the kitchen door, then came back in and sat down opposite me, lifting her glass in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk,\" she said, and downed her glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk? About what? You broke into my house. We don\u0027t need to talk, you need to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look good,\" Davina said, her eyes bright. She reached out and patted my hand. \"You got your color back, which is good. Especially after that incident in the alley next to Happy Larry\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a chill run down my back. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"I\u0027m talking about how I saved you from that guy.\" She made a flinging motion with her arm, then made some boom! pow! sounds to imitate knocking the guy out in the alley. Then, she giggled. \"Women\u0027s Ultimate Frisbee Champion, University of Louisiana, 1981.\" She glowed, proud of herself. \"I still got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... what the...? That was you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure was,\" she said. \"And I saw what you did, too. Dog!\" She laughed and clapped her hands. \"Very impressive work, and really advanced for someone who\u0027s only been at it for what? A week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and sat back. \"You saw ... the dog?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ... you couldn\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027ve spent the better part of the last few days convincing myself none of that happened. That it was a drunken hallucination, a brain tumor maybe. I was making progress with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ain\u0027t no brain tumor, baby. It\u0027s magic and you have it.\" She giggled again, like a little girl. \"Isn\u0027t it exciting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her. I had a lot of emotions whirling within me at the moment. Excitement wasn\u0027t one of them. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know who I am. I\u0027m Davina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean ... what is up with you? You threw a gym sock at me. What was that about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was necessary. I had to be sure you were who I thought you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was in the gym sock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked to the ceiling for a moment as she composed her answer, then smiled at me. \"Think of it as a magical DNA test. It came out positive, and unblocked your power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any power,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know an aluminum dog might beg to differ with you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and speaking of that ... why didn\u0027t you just come out in the alley instead of throwing things? I was totally freaked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I couldn\u0027t risk that man seeing me with you, baby.\" She leaned forward. \"He\u0027s trying to kill me. Who knows what he\u0027d do to you if he knew we were friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill you? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for the same reason anyone wants to kill anyone else,\" Davina said simply. \"He\u0027s crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another sip, a grim look on her face. \"His name is Cain. Avoid him. He\u0027s bad news.\" Her expression brightened. \"I want to talk about you. What other magic have you done? Anything fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her for a moment, trying to figure out what the hell she was talking about, then gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Okay. That\u0027s it.\" I got up and pushed through the kitchen door, walking into the living room, and hunting for my cordless phone. I never put it back on the stupid cradle, and I can never find it when I need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Davina\u0027s footsteps coming up behind me. \"What\u0027s the matter, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The matter? I don\u0027t know. Trash can lids turning into dogs. Strange men trying to kill you. Either I\u0027m nuts, or you\u0027re nuts. Likely, we\u0027re both nuts. Maybe you\u0027re not even real. Either way, doesn\u0027t matter. I need to call someone. Like ... I don\u0027t know. A doctor? Maybe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started pawing through my couch cushions, feeling underneath them for the phone. Davina\u0027s hand clamped down on my arm, pulling me back. I stared at her dark fingers over my skin. I could feel them there. I looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can feel you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out and poked her cheek with one finger, and she swatted my hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m real,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out of her grip. \"Look, go away. I know you\u0027re not real. You\u0027re a hallucination, and the trash-can-lid dog was a hallucination, and that guy probably was, too. I\u0027m going to call a doctor, and he\u0027s going to give me drugs that make the whole bunch of you go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina stared at me, and took a step back. Good. I went back into the couch cushions and my hands hit something hard and plastic. I pulled it out: the phone. I held it out to her like a weapon, hit the call button. The numbers on the dial pad lit up orange, and I poised my fingers over it to dial ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... but I didn\u0027t have a number to call. I needed the Yellow Pages. Except - crap - it was after five. I wouldn\u0027t be able to make an appointment. Did this qualify as an emergency? Should I call 911?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Davina. She was either real, and had broken into my house, or she wasn\u0027t, and I was hallucinating. Both possibilities counted as emergencies in my book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine-one-one it is,\" I said, and dialed the 9, but then Davina said, \"Don\u0027t do that,\" and touched my arm and I wigged out and tossed the phone up into the air. My hands tingled with extreme heat, and I felt dizzy and disoriented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agh!\" I yelled. \"Don\u0027t do that. You\u0027re freaking me out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Olivia,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I need my phone. I need to call nine-one-one.\" I glanced around the floor, looking for where the phone had landed, but I didn\u0027t see it anywhere. I was just registering that I couldn\u0027t recall hearing it fall to the ground when something flew past my head. I swatted at it and looked up to see a small black body floating above my head with bony wings, wisps of electric yellow light circling around it as it flew ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bat!\" I screamed, pointing, but Davina just stared, watching it fly around. I stared, too, looking closer as it flew in circles overhead. It had bat wings, and a bat body, but on closer inspection, it seemed to be made of some kind of hard plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were glowing orange numbers on its chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina just watched it, smiling as her eyes followed its circular arcs around the room, banging into walls, zooming back, and trying again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus!\" I yelled as the thing swooped down at me. I grabbed Davina and used her as a human shield, hiding behind her. \"Oh, god, I hate bats!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina angled around and looked at me, her face warm and smiling. \"You have been practicing. Good girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ducked down behind her. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" I pointed at the bat. \"Kill it, kill it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t kill it.\" She motioned up toward the bat, her face aglow with joy. \"That there isn\u0027t a bat. Bats don\u0027t fly during sunlight. They also don\u0027t have glowing numbers on their bellies, and they aren\u0027t made of plastic. That there\" - she pointed to the bat, which bounced blindly off the living room wall and course-corrected into the opposite wall - \"is your magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My what?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina turned to where I was crouching behind her and pulled me up by my shoulders. She positioned me in front of her and said in my ear, \"That\u0027s your magic, baby. Isn\u0027t it beautiful?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-little-night-magic-nodaway-falls-1/page-4.html","bookId":2134,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:02 PM"}
