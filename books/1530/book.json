And now the search for answers is leading Lady Kara Kensington; her friend Safia al-Maaz, the gallery\u0027s brilliant and beautiful curator; and their guide, the international adventurer Omaha Dunn, into a world they never dreamed existed: a lost city buried beneath the Arabian desert. But others are being drawn there as well, some with dark and sinister purposes.
