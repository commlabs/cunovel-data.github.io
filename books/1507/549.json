{"id":52874,"no":549,"title":"Chapter 546: The Patriarch Goes All Out!","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 546: The Patriarch Goes All Out!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipples of Spirit Severing Power expanded out in all directions. Meng Hao’s hair whipped about as his Cultivation base roared upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spirit Severing power did not belong to him; he could only possess it temporarily. Even the Domain was not his, but rather, that of the Blood Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Spirit Severing Cultivation base growth, shockingly, an Area world appeared around Meng Hao. Within his mind, he could also faintly sense the Domain of the Blood Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he could not utilize them. All he could do was vaguely sense them…. The Domain actually had nothing to do with blood. Strangely, it contained a sense of waiting, as well as of glorious pursuit. It was like a blooming, blood-colored flower….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment that Meng Hao borrowed the Spirit Severing power, the expulsion power around him instantly grew weaker by more than half. The vortex in mid-air vanished without a trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn expression of disbelief appeared on the face of Patriarch Huyan. Never could he possibly have imagined that the battle would go the way it had, or that he would end up being so shaken by Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible?! How can he be so terrifying!? Don’t tell me that he’s… a Dao Seeking reincarnation!? Or maybe… he’s an Immortal’s Soul in a mortal body!?!?” Even as Patriarch Huyan was reeling in shock, Meng Hao looked up. He could sense the undefinable power that was surging within him. He couldn’t sustain such power for long, only about the space of twelve breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, he didn’t hesitate. The glow of blood surged up around him as he lifted his right hand up and performed an incantation gesture, then pointed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sundered clouds, a bloody rain, seas that cover the sky!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree forms of the Blood Immortal legacy divine ability. The body of the Blood Immortal. A Spirit Severing Cultivation base. In this moment, the power of all of these things exploded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was now the color of blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the red glow, the Violet Sea turned black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, all that could be seen was a black sea and a red sky, with just a glimmer of violet in between the two. Even an expert artist would have a hard time depicting such a scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were clouds in the sky, sundered clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was rain as well, a rain of blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sea of blood roared with huge waves that seemed to wish to fly up to the heavens. The sea of blood merged with the Violet Sea, transforming into black blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSundered clouds, a bloody rain, seas that cover the sky. These three things were Blood Immortal divine abilities, majestic and shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sundered clouds surged into motion, causing vapor to instantly rise up around Patriarch Huyan’s Nascent Divinity Spirit Immortal. From within the thick clouds emerged… sundering!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as the sundering mist exploded. Patriarch Huyan’s Nascent Divinity Spirit Immortal emitted a shrill cry. It was shocked to discover that it couldn’t evade and was powerless to fight back! The natural law in the world seemed to have completely changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese rules did not belong to him, but rather, to Meng Hao. Or perhaps… to the woman who sat behind Meng Hao on the throne of bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sundered clouds surged endlessly. That was because they were propelled by a wind of sundering. Roaring filled the air as, within the short space of time of a few breaths, Patriarch Huyan’s Nascent Divinity Spirit Immortal was battered dozens of times. He was forced backward several hundred meters. Explosions and booms echoed out; it seemed as if the Nascent Divinity Spirit Immortal was on the verge of being destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shocked, filled with disbelief as well as an intense sense of deadly crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment, a rain of blood appeared in the midst of the sundered clouds. It carried with it a shocking power, seemingly another expulsion power. The raindrops fell down from all directions toward Patriarch Huyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bloodcurdling scream could be heard. Patriarch Huyan was flabbergasted and shaking with fear. Booming could be heard as his body began to fall apart. He quickly pulled it back together, only to have more blood rain whistle toward him. As of this moment, the entire world, everything in the area, was transformed into a world of blood rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin that world, all life would be submerged, buried in the blood rain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut… this was not the greatest danger. The greatest danger… was within the black sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea roared up into the sky. The sky roared down into the sea. The blackness of the once violet-colored sea, merged with the blood rain, turning it black!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black sea rose up into the sky, making it impossible to determine what was the sky and what was the sea. It was as if everything had been turned upside down, as if everything had been twisted about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin all the booming and roaring, the sundered clouds, the blood rain, the black sea, became… Blood Death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan was filled with a sense of grave danger. He had the intense premonition that if he didn’t do something immediately, then he… would definitely die!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf someone had told him before that he would die at Meng Hao’s hands, he would have mocked and ridiculed that person to no end. But now… such a scene was playing out in front of his own eyes. As of this moment, though, there was no time for shock and astonishment. Heart pounding, he suddenly looked up into the sky and roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoists, the three of you must help me slay this man! Regardless of whether you succeed or not, I vow to present you with precious treasures as gifts in return!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing this caused the streams of Divine Sense to instantly reveal intense glows. They immediately began to discuss the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s really no need to continue watching the battle,” said the Spirit Severing Patriarch from the great Cloud Sky Tribe. “The clone is doomed to perish. This Meng Hao has fused his will with the Violet Sea. He’s not someone to be provoked lightly.” His words contained deeper meaning, which was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoist Yunlian, don’t worry. True, we’re allies, and therefore can’t go back on our word to help each other. However, the best thing to do would be to leave with the promise of treasure from Patriarch Huyan, and at the same time get Meng Hao to owe us a favor. Sowing some good Karma would be the best outcome!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. It was of his own accord that Patriarch Huyan provoked a powerful foe. He can’t blame anyone else. If the Heavenly Court Alliance loses the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, but then gains the great Cloud Sky Tribe, it will still be a Heavenly Court.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter discussing the matter, the three streams of Divine Sense began to chuckle. Three forms began to take shape out of nothing. In the blink of an eye, three figures could be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne was a white-haired old man. Another was a middle-aged man with a luxuriant beard. The third was a young boy in a red robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they appeared, they exchanged smiling glances. These were all clones, the likes of which most Spirit Severing Cultivators possessed. They were different from Patriarch Huyan’s clone, which was a type that was rarely seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, the three figures appeared in front of Patriarch Huyan’s Nascent Divinity. Without even a pause, they charged Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of these clones possessed roughly thirty percent of the power of the Cultivation base of their true selves. However, even thirty percent should be enough to crush someone of the Nascent Soul stage. They instantly turned into three fierce beams of light that shot toward Meng Hao’s three great Blood Immortal divine abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered in response to the attack. For these three people to make a move wasn’t something unforeseen. He waved his sleeve. The sundered clouds roared, the blood rain howled, and the black sea screamed. The three forces slammed into the three clones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This guy is incredible! Now that I’m experiencing his power, it’s obvious that he’s far stronger than I imagined after simply observing him fight!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If our clones met him by themselves, and he unleashed his full power, it would only take a few moves for him to completely eradicate us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three exchanged another glance, then performed incantation gesture, causing their own divine abilities to blast into Meng Hao’s Blood Immortal divine abilities. During the space of a few breaths, booms filled the air. The three clones exploded, completely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they completely vanished, all of them cast meaningful glances toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan stared in shock, and then began to tremble. He lifted his head up and howled. How could he not see through the plan the three crafty old foxes had just carried out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three clones weren’t as strong as Patriarch Huyan’s clone, so if they were fighting solo, they might be destroyed relatively quickly. But how could it be possible for them to be defeated so quickly while fighting together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only explanation was that all three had actually been unwilling to attack. Everything they had done was just an excuse to get their hands on the treasure that he had promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan’s expression was one of livid fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I’m going to die, there’s no way I’ll die by his hand!” he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Totems combine….” he cried. Suddenly, five and a half totems appeared within this Nascent Divinity and then suddenly flew out. Within the half totem could be seen several souls that bore an eerie resemblance to Patriarch Huyan. They formed together to… form the eight sons that had been personally slain by Patriarch Huyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, because Huyan Qing had died in the way he did, the totem was incomplete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the appearance of these totems, Patriarch Huyan’s expression was suddenly one of complete resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ancestral Awakening, commence!” As Patriarch Huyan roared, the five totems shattered, transforming into countless fragments that instantly fused into the Nascent Divinity Spirit Immortal. Patriarch Huyan’s roar turned into a wail as the Nascent Divinity began to turn blurry, and then suddenly exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exploding pieces almost looked like human flesh. They shot out, but then just as quickly began to form back together. In the blink of an eye, an indescribably gruesome aura suddenly spread out to fill the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Patriarch Huyan’s Nascent Divinity was reforming, turning into a body formed out of countless chunks of flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like innumerable patches of flesh were sewn together, as if the body were covered with countless centipedes. It was thoroughly savage in appearance, especially the forehead, where three golden scales could be seen that emanated blinding golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bizarre, gruesome aura completely matched the bizarre, gruesome body. This was Patriarch Huyan’s Ancestral Awakening body, the result of the most powerful divine ability that his clone could employ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head had no facial features, only the three golden scales which were almost like eyes. They glowed with golden, flickering light that transformed into an enormous vortex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vortex spun, seemingly powerful enough to shatter the air. As it expanded out, everything for thousands of meters around instantly began to shatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sundered clouds shattered, the blood rain dissipated and the black sea was destroyed. Meng Hao’s three Blood Immortal divine abilities were completely dispelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan was burning his life force. His Cultivation base was blurry, and his appearance bizarre in this Ancestral Awakening form, which could explode out with power to destroy anything and everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Blood Immortal divine abilities were destroyed, Patriarch Huyan’s strange body disappeared. When he reappeared, he was directly in front of Meng Hao. He lifted up his hand and pushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered. Without hesitation he waved his sleeve, borrowing explosive Spirit Severing power to shoot backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I only have about seven more breaths worth of time before I run out of Spirit Severing power!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glowed with coldness. Setting his jaw, he stared at Patriarch Huyan. From the look of it, this version of Patriarch Huyan was not sentient, but rather, was acting on instinct. The strange divine ability would only last for a certain period of time before it ran out of life force power to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going all out?” said Meng Hao with a cold laugh. “Unfortunately for you, I still have a lot of tricks up my sleeve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Nam Tran, Graham Kemp, Yanuar Yaputra and James Timmermans\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-545\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-547\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-546","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
