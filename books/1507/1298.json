He felt almost as if he were facing the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea. Although he seemed calm, beneath the surface, he was terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man’s dual pupils constricted, and he immediately waved his hand dismissively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Withdraw!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat single word caused all of the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea to be filled with shock. They began to back up, opening up a path in front of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man frowned, then barked, “I said to withdraw!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice echoed out like thunder into the ears of the hundreds of thousands of cultivators, whose minds spun. Almost immediately, they began to scatter away from the region of the rift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other three Dao Realm experts frowned in response to the red-haired old man’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch Chi, this isn’t very appropriate,” said the almighty Dao Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut your mouth!” the old man roared. “I don’t need you criticizing my orders.” He leveled a glare at the Dao Lord, then turned towards the rest of the cultivators and frowned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Withdraw further! Get five thousand kilometers away from here. Without my authorization, none of you are to set foot into this area. Go, now!” The booming of the old man’s voice echoed within the minds of the hundreds of thousands of cultivators. They had no way to sense how terrifying Meng Hao was, but they could not afford to disregard the orders of the red-haired old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, the hundreds of thousands of cultivators were in full flight. Soon, that five thousand kilometer area around the rift was completely empty except for the four Dao Realm experts, the leader of whom was the red-haired old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man stared at Meng Hao as he slowly rose to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis condescending manner caused the Dao Lord he had just rebuked to snort coldly, and his eyes to flicker with venomous hatred. However, the Dao Lord wasn’t in the mood to get into an altercation, so he said nothing. But then, he looked more closely at Meng Hao, and just like the red-haired old man, he could sense the terrifying fluctuations hidden within him, and his eyes went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two 1-Essence Dao Realm cultivators’ expressions also became serious. As soon as the red-haired old man rose to his feet they also stood up, gathering the power of their cultivation bases to summon various magical techniques and items as if they were facing up against a mighty opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was calm as he looked over this red-haired old man. The old man had complied with Meng Hao’s wishes to send the hundreds of thousands of cultivators away, which left Meng Hao with a somewhat favorable impression of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could tell that some level of benevolence existed within his heart, and that he realized having all of the other cultivators around when they were fighting would do little good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, those hundreds of thousands of cultivators would definitely end up being killed or simply fleeing. Allowing them to leave now was actually the best way to keep the forces of the Seventh Mountain and Sea at top strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man looked at Meng Hao, his heart full of caution, then asked, “Who are you, your Excellency?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao,” was the calm response as he walked forward. Almost immediately, the spell formations and restrictive spells burst out loudly, filling the area with brilliant light as they were completely activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in that exact moment, booms rang out as the restrictive spells collapsed and the spell formations exploded in brilliant flashes of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao advanced, all of the restrictive spells and spell formations were destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the mere pressure and energy coming off of Meng Hao turned into a power that could counteract anything, could crush all resistance like dried weeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man’s face fell, and the eyes of the Dao Lord next to him went wide. The other two 1-Essence Dao Realm experts felt their hearts beating out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this takes some time to describe, but actually happened in the briefest instant. As the Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering roaring booms filled the area around the rift, a blinding light spread out in all directions that seemed bright enough to light up the entire starry sky. When that light faded away, it almost seemed as if the previously glorious light of the starry sky was now gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing left behind were ripples that spread out into the distance, filling a five thousand kilometer area.... As of this moment, all of the spell formations in the area... had been completely destroyed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hundreds of thousands of cultivators outside of the five thousand kilometer area could sense what had happened, and their minds filled with shock. That was especially true of the Ancient Realm experts. Despite having left the area, their divine sense enabled them to observe what was happening, and when they saw Meng Hao simply take a few steps, and use the pressure emanating from him to destroy all of the spell formations, their minds filled with raging waves of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What... what cultivation base is that?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dao Realm, and definitely not an ordinary Dao Realm cultivation base!” Everyone was astonished, and the four Dao Realm experts’ hearts were pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccompanied by ear-splitting booms that caused everything to grow dark, Meng Hao suddenly appeared only 300 meters in front of the group of four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he didn’t stop there. He continued to advance casually, not even looking at the red-haired old man or the others. Instead, he was staring at the rift which had been torn open in the starry sky, and the beast which was still holding the rift open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat beast did not look like it once had when it had pried the rift open; it had transformed into creeping vines which covered both sides of the rift, preventing it from closing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao got closer to the rift, he could sense an astonishing life force approaching, getting nearer and nearer. He could tell that it wouldn’t be very long before that life force reached the rift and stepped into the Eighth Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao neared the rift, the steps he took didn’t appear out of the ordinary, and yet the red-haired old man and the others could sense a terrifying rumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe level of terror they felt increased with each step, and the booms grew louder. The 1-Essence Dao Realm experts’ faces were ashen, and blood began to ooze out of their mouths. Their expressions were those of complete terror as they were forced to step back in retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext was the Dao Lord, who also began to fall back, and finally, the red-haired old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had no choice but to do so; as Meng Hao got closer, it felt to them as if a massive millstone was approaching, and if they didn’t fall back, they would be destroyed, crushed into nothing but paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao slowly advanced, and the group of four fell back again. Next, the Dao Lord began to bleed from the mouth. When Meng Hao was about 150 meters away, the pressure was so intense, and their fear so great, that it was as if all the Heavens were bearing down on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCracks began to echo out from inside the bodies of the 1-Essence Dao Realm cultivators as they began to fall apart. The Dao Lord’s face was now magenta, and his blood could hardly flow through his veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man was trembling, and to him, it felt as if he were standing within the shadow of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey let out powerful roars, and their eyes filled with looks of madness. They knew that if they didn’t do something about this pressure then they would soon lose any ability to resist it, and if Meng Hao took even a few more steps, they would be crushed to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man threw his head back and roared, fully rotating his cultivation base. Rumbling booms could be heard as he transformed into a beam of light that shot toward Meng Hao. His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, and a bizarre light shone from his pupils, causing the void ahead of him to distort. The pitch-black ox also threw its head back and bellowed, lowering its head to charge Meng Hao with its horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a spectacular and shocking scene!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, the red-haired old man’s cultivation base was bursting with power. He waved his hand, causing Essence power to surge out. Four streams of essence could be seen: wind, rain, thunder, and lightning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was like a storm, the rain was the Essence of water, the thunder was a roar, and the lightning crackled and danced. The four streams of Essence formed into the pattern of a spell formation which could shake Heaven and Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man was the type to either not attack, or attack with his most powerful Daos. In addition to what he had already done, all of a sudden, his hair suddenly flew out, transforming into a crimson sea which covered the entire area. It rapidly became a blood mist, which was the Essence the old man was currently exploring, his fifth Essence. Although he hadn’t completed the process, it still bolstered the power of his other Essences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, the Dao Lord trembled in madness, performing an incantation gesture to unleash a divine ability. A beam of light shot toward Meng Hao at incredible speed, piercing through the starry sky. Simultaneously, the image of numerous sword projections became visible around the Dao Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost in the blink of an eye, there were more than 10,000 of them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis murderous aura was so strong that everything shook violently. Shockingly, behind each sword projection was a vicious spirit, which propelled the swords toward Meng Hao, making it seem as if Meng Hao was not facing one opponent, but rather 10,000 sword cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast were the two 1-Essence cultivators. Their cultivation bases were relatively limited, and because of the pressure from Meng Hao, they paid the steepest price of the group. Blood sprayed out of their mouths, their eyes were bloodshot, and their jaws were tightly clenched. Neither of them had more than one Essence, but even still, they combined their power to produce the image of a sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at his four opponents, and then stepped down with his right foot. When he did, he passed the thirty meter mark to appear directly in front of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stepped down, the starry sky rumbled, and an astonishing power exploded out from him. His right hand reached out to tap one of the pitch-black ox\u0027s horns. The ox let out a miserable shriek and collapsed into pieces. At the same time, the wave of Meng Hao’s hand caused the red-haired old man\u0027s Essences to be obliterated. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he was sent spinning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao turned, snorting coldly. The sound echoed out, slamming into the 10,000 sword projections, shattering them. The sword cultivator Dao Lord coughed up a mouthful of blood, and was already on the point of being killed, all by a mere snort. He instantly fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the two 1-Essence Dao Realm cultivators, all it took was a mere look from Meng Hao. His gaze was like a sword that shattered their sun image, and left them coughing up blood and fleeing in retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Considering none of you have Outsider totem tattoos, I won’t kill you,” he said coolly. Then, he was in front of the rift. The red-haired old man and the others were completely shaken, and were now looking at Meng Hao with unmitigated awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring them, Meng Hao looked at the rift, eyes glittering. Then he sat down cross-legged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m waiting for you,” he said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only response was an icy cold harrumph, echoing out slowly from within the rift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1293\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1295\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1294","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
