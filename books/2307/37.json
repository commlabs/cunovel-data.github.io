All she could think of was that Gabriel was meeting Quillan at midnight; that they\u0027d have the formula in their hands. Only two weeks until Halloween, she thought. Only two weeks to make a decision that would have monumental influence on the rest of their lives. Quillan had said the journey back to life had always been fatal. Did she want Gabriel to be mortal again badly enough to risk his life? If the cure didn\u0027t work, Gabriel would die a horrible death. Gabriel had said he would not let her go in this life, that he would not stand by and watch her die again, and so there were really only two choices: they must find a cure for what he was, or she would have to become a vampire... and she knew that was something she could never do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Quillan was right. Maybe Gabriel should transform her against her will. Maybe she could accept it then, but even as the thought crossed her mind, she knew she would never forgive him, that no matter how difficult the decision might be, it had to be her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever had the hours of the day passed so slowly. She tried to read, tried to watch TV, but she was too restless to sit still, and so she paced the living-room floor, wishing the sun would hurry across the sky, wishing for dusk so she could be with Gabriel. She needed to feel his arms around her, to hear his words of reassurance chasing away her fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the shadows grew long, she went out to stand on the veranda, watching the sun make its downward climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had not yet disappeared when she sensed his presence behind her. With a glad heart, she ran into the house and flung herself in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold me!\" she cried. \"Hold me and never let go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t go tonight. Forget about the cure. Stay with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to try it, Sarah. If there\u0027s any chance at all, I have to try it.\" He tilted her head up. \"It\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that. You\u0027re doing it for me, I know you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want us to be together, not just at night. I want to live as a man again, to walk in the sun with you at my side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it doesn\u0027t work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you must go on with your life. Find a man who will love you and give you children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You found me in this life, cara. If it\u0027s possible, I will find you in death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind was made up, and there was nothing she could say to change it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carried her upstairs and made love to her, slowly, deliberately, savoring each sensation, storing them in his mind. If the cure proved ineffective, he would have only these last two weeks to live. To a man who had survived over four and a half centuries, two weeks seemed but a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the hours sped swiftly by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo soon, it was almost midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying in bed, Sarah watched him dress. He left the room for a moment, and when he returned, he was wearing his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be long,\" he promised, bestowing a kiss on her cheek. \"Keep the bed warm for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe choked back a sob as she watched him leave the room, overcome with a terrible premonition that she would never see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened at his bidding. He stood in the entryway for a moment, his senses probing the darkness of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In here, Giovanni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuillan\u0027s voice. Deep. Predatory. Deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, Gabriel realized Quillan had not come alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree vampires materialized out of the shadows; a fourth ghosted up behind him, cutting off his escape. Fledglings all, they circled him like winter-starved wolves, fangs gleaming even in the darkness, eyes aglow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear slithered down Gabriel\u0027s spine. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot let you rejoin the ranks of humanity,\" Quillan said flatly. \"You know our habits, our weaknesses. We cannot take a chance that you might turn against us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I do that? What would I have to gain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuillan shrugged. \"Everything. Nothing. As I said, it is a chance we cannot take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel glanced over his shoulder. A tall, slender vampire stood behind him, a stake clutched in his gloved hands. \"So you\u0027re going to destroy me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuillan nodded. \"A stake through the heart has always been the preferred method,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel was afraid, and he didn\u0027t like it. Afraid for himself. Afraid for Sarah. \"What of the woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She dies, too. Delano and Sydelle are on their way as we speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" The denial was ripped from Gabriel\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have survived thousands of years only because we have never let mankind know of our existence. They may suspect. They may have seen or heard something for which they have no logical explanation, but they do not want to believe. The woman dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quillan, please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late, Giovanni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved toward him, closing the circle. But Gabriel had not survived as long as he had by being foolish. In 464 years, he had trusted no other vampire, and only two mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low growl, he sprinted past the two young vampires in front of him, his hand reaching inside his cloak, delving into his pants pocket as he vaulted the stairs to the second-story landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhirling around, he fired the pistol four times in rapid succession. The bullets, made of solid silver, had been loaded into the gun by the man who owned the gun shop. They struck the fledgling vampires with deadly precision, and then Quillan was on him, knocking the pistol from his grasp. Locked together, they tumbled down the stairs. Quillan, heavier, older, was on top when they hit the bottom of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands closed around Gabriel\u0027s throat, his weight pinning Gabriel to the floor as he bent toward him, his fangs bared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not fight me, Giovanni,\" Quillan rasped, his hand closing over the stake that had fallen from his fledgling\u0027s hand. \"You are too late to save the woman, and in a moment, you will join her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah heard the front door open and breathed a sigh of relief. He was back!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up, combing her fingers through her hair, her heart pounding with happiness. So much for premonitions, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard footsteps on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfamiliar footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze darted around the room, seeking a weapon, but found nothing. Muttering a silent prayer, she climbed out of bed and went into the bathroom. Locking the door, she pawed through the drawers, but the most dangerous thing she found was a blow dryer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears of frustration welled in her eyes as she bunched her gown in one hand and climbed out the window. Behind her, she heard someone pounding on the door, and then she heard Sydelle\u0027s voice, soft and seductive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us in, Sarah,\" the vampire called. \"Gabriel is dead, and there\u0027s nowhere you can hide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead! No! He couldn\u0027t be dead. She slid down the slope of the roof, grabbed hold of a tree branch, and made her way to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHide. She had to hide. But where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a faint crash as the vampires broke down the bathroom door. A moment later, she saw Sydelle\u0027s face at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenalin pumping, Sarah ran toward the corral. Never in her life had she vaulted onto a horse\u0027s back, but she did so now. Wrapping her hands in the stallion\u0027s mane, she drummed her heels into the horse\u0027s flanks and Necromancer bolted forward. A sharp kick sent him sailing over the six-foot fence. For a moment, Sarah swayed precariously on the stallion\u0027s bare back, and then they were racing toward the back gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse came to a gravel-scattering halt when they reached the block wall. With fingers that trembled, Sarah opened the gate, then drummed her heels into Necromancer\u0027s flanks once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear Sydelle calling her name, but she paid no attention. Gabriel, she thought frantically. She had to find Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stallion\u0027s iron-shod hooves clattered loudly as he trotted down the middle of the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse snorted and shied as they reached the bottom of the hill. Sarah screamed as two dark shadows crept up behind her. Delano and Sydelle! How had they gotten there so fast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shriek, Sarah jumped to the ground and sprinted up the walkway to the front door of the vacant house. With a sob, she flung the door open and raced inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peered into the darkness, acutely conscious of the two vampires entering the house behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she saw Gabriel. He was sitting with his back against the staircase. Moonlight poured through the sliding glass door a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel?\" She ran to his side, Delano and Sydelle forgotten as she saw the dead vampires sprawled on the floor. Nausea rose in her throat when she saw Quillan\u0027s body. A wooden stake pierced the vampire\u0027s heart. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gabriel wasn\u0027t looking at her. He was staring at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfraid of what she\u0027d see, Sarah glanced over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelano and Sydelle stood silhouetted in the doorway. Even from across the room, Sarah could see the blood hunger burning in their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stake, Sarah,\" Gabriel said quietly. \"Get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him as if he\u0027d lost his mind, her whole being recoiling in horror at the thought of pulling the wood from the vampire\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\" Gabriel hissed, and only then did she notice how pale his face was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze swept over him, and she saw the blood, blood so dark it was almost black, seeping from a hideous wound in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry,\" he said urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at Delano and Sydelle, saw the rage contorting their faces. Bloodred tears welled in Delano\u0027s eyes as he stared at Quillan\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, Sarah wrapped her hands around the wooden stake and jerked it free, and then she scooted back toward Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" she asked, but she didn\u0027t need or expect an answer. Everything she needed to know was written on the faces of the two vampires as they slowly stepped into the entry hall and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was shivering now. Cold sweat beaded across her brow and ran in cold rivers down her back. Try as she might, she couldn\u0027t draw her eyes from the two vampires. She was going to die, she thought, here, tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one brief moment when everything seemed to happen in slow motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft grunt of pain escaped Gabriel\u0027s lips as he stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw Delano bare his fangs as he lunged forward, his hands looking like claws as he reached for Gabriel\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Sydelle sprang toward her, and time ceased to exist. The vampire\u0027s strength was incredible. Sarah gasped as she was driven backward. The breath whooshed from her lungs as she fell against the staircase. Her head struck one of the steps and bright lights flashed before her eyes. She felt Sydelle\u0027s hands wrap around her throat, heard a blood curdling growl as the vampire attacked her. Using her teeth and her fingernails, Sydelle savaged Sarah\u0027s face and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear lent strength to Sarah\u0027s limbs and she began to struggle wildly. Lifting her arm, she jabbed the stake she was still holding into the vampire\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roar, Sydelle plucked the stake from Sarah\u0027s hand and flung it aside. And then Sarah felt the woman\u0027s fangs at her throat. There was a sharp pain, and then everything went out of focus. The room and its occupants seemed to blur. As if from far away, she heard sounds of a struggle. Gabriel was fighting for his life, she thought numbly. She had to help him. But her arms and legs refused to move, and then everything went black...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was drifting, floating on a sea of darkness, when she heard his voice. He was crying, and the sound of his heartache made her want to cry, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrying, she thought, and she knew in that instant that Gabriel was crying for her, because she was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge didn\u0027t frighten her as it should have. She looked around, puzzled by the darkness. Where was the tunnel and the bright light everyone talked about, she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard his voice again, sobbing for her to come back, pleading with her not to leave him again. Begging her to forgive him for what he was about to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to speak, tried to tell him that everything would be all right, but she no longer had the power to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard his voice grow faint as she floated farther and farther away. She tried to call his name, tried to tell him she would find him again no matter how long it took, but it was too late... too late...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on the very brink of oblivion when a sudden warmth filled her. It was thick and hard to swallow, but it drew her back from the edge of the abyss. She felt it course through her body, and then she heard his voice again, urgent, filled with love. And regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink, Sarah,\" he said. \"Drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObediently, she opened her mouth, and he pressed his wrist to her lips again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink,\" he commanded, and she felt his hand at the back of her neck, holding her in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because she feared the darkness, because she didn\u0027t want to leave him again, she did as he asked, her throat convulsing as she swallowed again and again, until, with a groan, Gabriel jerked his arm away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough, cara,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyelids fluttered open and she looked up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll explain later,\" he promised, gently brushing a lock of hair from her brow. \"Sleep now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave me!\" She couldn\u0027t bear the thought of being parted from him again. \"Please don\u0027t leave me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight, until she felt her heart beating in time with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t leave you, cara,\" he promised, his voice infinitely sad. \"But you must rest now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to sleep. She wanted to know what had happened to Delano and Sydelle, wanted to know why she felt so strange, why the thought of being separated from him for even a moment filled her with such gut-wrenching anxiety, but a lethargy unlike anything she had ever known was creeping over her, dragging her down into oblivion once more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/embrace-the-night/page-37.html","bookId":2307,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM"}
