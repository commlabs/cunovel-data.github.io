She’s been talking to Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Have you been talking to Max? How do you know about Nik the Dick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Haha, he might’ve mentioned it when he brought the passes to Safira.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Whatever he tells you, I’ll deny it all. How did you enjoy yourself at the club?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Oh. My. Gawd!!! It was awesome! The girls have already decided we’ll be back this Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m really happy about this. I’m smiling like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: That’s great. I’m so glad you girls enjoyed yourselves. Like I said, that booth is yours. I’ll reserve it under Safira again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Awesome! Thanks :) will u guys be joining us again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Definitely but we’ll have to take turns because we all work on club nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Really?! I know u own it but what do the other guys do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Ghost runs security and mans the CCTV, Trick does a bit of everything, and Max is a VIP host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Wicked. How cool is it 2 work with ur best friends?! I love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Yeah, it’s pretty great. How’s work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Well I was so busy I 4got 2 get lunch so I’m a little hungry :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t like that. She should’ve sent one of the girls to get something for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: That’s not good. You need to take better care of yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: I know…but Nat hasn’t eaten either so we’ll get an early dinner. Sorry Nik, I’ve got 2 go. Talk 2 u later x\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb has logged off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the little kiss she wrote. I stare at the little x a few seconds before I grab my wallet, then I’m out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will this day never end?” Nat complains as puts her forehead on the counter with a thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s only the two of us at the store today and we’ve been pretty busy. There was a pupil free day at a few schools around the area so we’ve been off the hook, packed full of young girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve sold a bucket load of jewellery, bags, and accessories. So, even though we’re exhausted and haven’t eaten, we’re happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat’s just seen to a small group of high school girls and the exhaustion is catching up to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawr Raaawr\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both look up and there’s Nik, looking handsome as ever, holding a brown paper bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at the state of us both, shuts the door, and locks it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eat…Now.” He says this in a voice I wouldn’t dare to question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat walks over to him, puts a hand on his chest, and kisses his cheek. She beams, “You. Are. A. God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes the brown paper bag, clutches it to her chest as if it’s life saving medicine, and walks straight to the staff room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to him with a small smile. Without saying a word, I kiss his cheek, lean my head on his chest, and hug him tightly around the waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe places one arm around my back, uses the other to stroke my hair and admits, “I don’t like thinking about you goin’ hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, his arms are nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him and chuckle, “It was only a few hours but I’ll admit it, I am so hungry.” Still tight in his arms I ask, “So, what did ya bring me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik looks toward the staff room door and says, “Well actually, I got something for you, Nat, and for me. I missed lunch, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put on the best stern voice I can muster, “And you’re worried about me not taking care of myself? Tut tut.” I look to the staff room and sigh, “We better get in there or she’ll eat it all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie eats like a horse and never gains a pound. I hate her for that. In a loving, best friend way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntangling myself from Nik, I take his hand and lead him to the staff room. There is a small table which seats four people. Nat has already organized the food and placed three wrapped parcels and three salads in front of three of the four seats. Nik and Nat take a seat while I go over to the fridge and get us some sodas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a seat and we all unwrap our huge Reuben sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeez Louise, this guy is perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a mouthful of sandwich I moan, “You are a God, Mr Leokov.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChewing, he smiles at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the lids off all the salads and dress them. I start moving the olives in my salad to one side and notice Nik moving his cherry tomatoes to the side of his container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t like tomatoes?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks disgusted and states, “No, I don’t. I like them cooked but not raw. Mom tried to force ‘em on me when I was little but stopped when I threw up all over the dining table.” He chuckles to himself and says wistfully, “Good times”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat and I chuckle with him. He looks over to my container and questions, “You don’t like olives?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimace, “Yuk. No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik leans over me to my salad container, takes it over to his, and dumps all the olives into his salad. Then he lifts his container and puts his cherry tomatoes into my salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat and I watch fascinated like. He puts down both containers, claps his hands together, and smiles a triumphant smile. “Problem solved”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the heck? Where did that come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat and Nik are chatting away about EPL Soccer and I listen in silently. I find out he barracks for Tottenham and has been known to watch the games on cable even if it means getting up at 3am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tells us Max and Ceecee live with him and have since Ceecee became paraplegic; he doesn’t tell us what happened to her but I’m sure he believes it’s Max’s story to tell. Nik is thirty four. Ghost (whose name is really Asher) has been a part of his family since he moved in with them senior year of high school. I want to know more about that but don’t want to interrupt him. He tells us he’s owned the club for seven years and has two silent partners. Trick is Nik’s cousin, their mothers are sisters. I ask where Ceecee goes when Max works at the club. Nik tell us his Mom and sisters all take turns watching her and that Ghost is Ceecee’s godfather. He tells us a bit about the club. Nat and I are both listening closely; we’re both curious about our new friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straighten up having just remembered to ask him something. “I haven’t seen you taking your cigarette breaks anymore. You hiding from us?” I tease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks a bit sheepish as he rubs his hand on the back of his neck and says, “Well, see, I met this little woman who told me smoking kills.” He scrunches his face and looks at me, “So I quit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbelievable. I actually don’t know what to say. I’m pretty sure I mentioned the ‘smoking kills’ thing the first time I ever spoke to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s all it took to make him quit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I realize something, frown, and complain, “But now I won’t see you three times a day.” It’s only after I say it that I realize how pathetic I sound so I quickly add, “But it’s so good you’re quitting!” with a big smile and I quickly ask him more questions about the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhew, quick save!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour of random conversation passes and Nik stands and excuses himself. “Sorry to leave you ladies but I really have to finish some work.” He looks at me and informs, “By the way, we’re officially sponsored by NT3 Advertising. I got the contract in the mail today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat. Is. Awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, hug him, and smile. “Congratulations. I know it was a big one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugs me back quickly then looks at Nat and questions, “You know she’s the reason I got a seven hundred thousand dollar sponsorship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT THE HECK?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat gasps and we both stand there open mouthed. He takes in our obvious expressions and chuckles. “Yeesh, too cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts his fingers to us as a goodbye, unlocks the door and leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he said the sponsorship was a big one but I had no idea it was almost a million dollar contract. I suddenly don’t feel bad about taking the VIP passes anymore. He can afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one can resist the cupcakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat nudges my shoulder to get my attention and tells me, “I’ve changed my mind about him. I really, really, really like him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile up at her, “Yeah, me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike, a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to wake up early the next morning and make glazed donuts. I feed Bear then get my cook on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI double the dose so I can take some to The White Rabbit for Nik (and the guys) as a Thank You for the late lunch he brought us yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese donuts are baked not fried so I have no problems eating two of these babies each time I make them. They are soft, fluffy, and a classic. You can never go wrong with donuts. I mean, who doesn’t like a good donut?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m still in my bathrobe and just about finished glazing them when Nat emerges from her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take her in as she stumbles into the kitchen. Her hair is a mess, she hasn’t opened her eyes, and she looks adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh at the state she’s in. “Hey, you didn’t have to get up for another half hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally opens her eyes, sits at a stool next to the counter, and confesses, “I swear I don’t know how I got here, I just followed my nose.” She looks at the counter and groans, “No! Not the cinnamon glaze!” She whines, “You know I can’t resist the cinnamon glaze!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat takes one of the cooler donuts in hand and takes a small bite. She lifts her eyes heavenward and moans, “Oh my God, my mouth just had a freaking orgasm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle and remind her, “Well, it’s been over a year since you had my donuts so you were due.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder I lost weight when you left,” she says with a smile. “No one was making me delicious baked goods to maintain my booty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, I tell her to get ready for work. Forty five minutes later, we’re ready and good to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe take the donuts and head to my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter battling with my car to let me in, I unlock the passenger door and Nat climbs in placing the donuts on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the key in and turn. Of course, nothing happens. Because what kind of car would actually turn on willingly? My baby has attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePumping the gas with one foot, I lift my other foot onto Nat’s lap and kick the passenger door while turning the ignition. Nat laughs at me. I scowl at her while continuing my morning car routine. I yell out over the thumps of my kicking, “I don’t know why this works but it just does!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few more seconds of beating the crap out of my car, the engine kicks over and we both whoop in delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I brake at the exit of the parking lot, my temperamental sweetheart stalls. Nat bursts out laughing. I pull my hands up to my face pretending to sob. I peek up at her through my hands and we both burst into hysterical laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time to get a new car me thinks,” she wheezes through her laughter. I know she’s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrudsickles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I go about beating the crap out of my car. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat and Lola open up at Safira while I make my way across the street to give the guys my breakfast delights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into the ‘chill out’ room and there’s nobody there. I try Nik’s office but it’s also empty. There are three doors at the opposite end of the hallway and I’m not sure why, but I hold onto my container full of donuts and tiptoe down to the other end of the hall like I’m a spy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCue mission impossible theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk passed the first two doors and find that the third door is actually an elevator. This must be how Ceecee gets up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think out loud, “That is so cool!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp, turn quickly and Ghost and I are nose to chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scream at the top of my lungs for a good five seconds right in his face. When I’m done I clutch my heaving chest and shriek, “What is with you guys and scaring the crap out of me?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost, still looking down at me and frowns, “Skittish little thing, aren’t ya?” He lifts his head back at the door behind him. “In there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow him into what looks to be a conference room. It has a long, large table in the middle with six seats on either side. There is a white board on the wall and a projector hooked up to the ceiling. Max, Nik, and Trick are sitting at the table looking at me smiling hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m immediately embarrassed for screeching like a banshee. I feel my face flush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax speaks up, “I thought I recognized that squeal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my lip, scrunch my brows, and look at them through squinted eyes. I quietly apologize, “I’m sorry. I hope I wasn’t interrupting anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost sits down and states, “You were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik throws a pen at Ghost, shoots him a dirty look, and says, “She was not, bonehead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to Ghost, place the container in front of him, and open the lid just a little so the smell of sugar and cinnamon waft up to him. I speak in an overly bored tone, “Oh, that’s okay. I can take my cinnamon glazed donuts back to the Safira if you don’t want them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widen before he glares up at me and mutters, “You don’t fight fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile brightly at him and stroke his hair, “Never said I would, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick is up and by my side in a jiffy and asks, “Wha- wha- what kind of donuts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, I open the container to show him the twelve cinnamon glazed donuts. He groans dramatically, hunches over and puts a hand on his knee as if to steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightens up and begs in a whisper, “I need one of those donuts.” He sounds like a junkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out the container to him and he takes two straight away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreedy guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know Ghost is dying for one; he keeps swallowing because he’s salivating. I walk over to the end of the table where there are clean plates, pick them up and place one in front of each of the guys. I put two donuts on each plate, apart from Trick’s. Then comes my favorite part; watching them enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey each take a bite and the room erupts in moans and groans. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-10.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
