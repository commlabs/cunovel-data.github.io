{"id":92081,"no":147,"title":"Page 147","content":"\u003cp\u003eYulan seemed perplexed. \"Highness, I . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trailed off as Mat yelled, \"Savara, we’re leading with pikes, not cavalry, you goat-loving idiot! I don’t care if the cavalry thinks it can do a better job. Cavalry always thinks that! What are you, a bloody Tairen High Lady? Well, I’ll name you an honorary one if you keep this up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatrim stormed off toward Savara, who sat her horse with arms folded, displeasure on her dark face. Yulan, left behind, looked completely bewildered. \"How does one hang a person by their toenails?\" Yulan asked, softly enough that Fortuona barely heard. \"I do not think that is possible. The nails would break off\". He walked away, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the side, Selucia signed, Beware. Galgan approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona steeled herself as Captain-General Galgan rode up. He wore black armor rather than a uniform like Mat’s, and he wore it well. Commanding, almost towering, he was her greatest rival and her strongest resource. Any man in his position would be a rival, of course. That was the way of things—the proper way of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatrim would never be a rival. She still did not know how to think of that. A piece of her—small, but not without strength—thought she should have him put away for that very reason. Was not the Prince of the Ravens a check upon the Empress, to keep her strong by providing a constant threat? Sarabat shaiqen nai batain pyast. A woman was most resourceful with a knife at her throat. A proverb uttered by Varuota, her great-great-great-grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would hate to put Matrim away. She couldn’t until she had a child by him, anyway—it would be ignoring the omens to do otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a strange man he was. Each time she thought she could anticipate him, she was proved wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greatest One\", Galgan said, \"we are nearly ready\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Prince of the Ravens is dissatisfied with the delays\", she said. \"He fears we are joining the battle too late\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the Prince of the Ravens has any real understanding of armies and battlefields\", Galgan said, his tone indicating that he didn’t believe such a thing was possible, \"he will realize that moving a force of this size requires no small effort\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until Matrim’s arrival, Galgan had been the highest-ranking member of the Blood in these lands other than Fortuona herself. He would dislike being superseded suddenly. As of yet, Galgan had command of their armies—and Fortuona intended to let him continue to lead. Earlier today, Galgan had asked Mat how he would gather their forces, and Mat had taken it as a suggestion to do just that. The Prince of the Ravens strode about giving orders, but he did not command. Not fully; Galgan could stop him with a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not. Obviously, he wished to see how Mat handled command. Galgan watched Mat, eyes narrowed. He did not fully know how the Prince of the Ravens fit into the command structure. Fortuona had yet to make a decision on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, a burst of wind carried away some dust. It revealed the small skull of a rodent, peeking from the earth. Another omen. Her life had been cluttered with them lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an omen of danger, of course. It was as if she strolled through deep grasses, passing between stalking lopar and among holes dug to catch the unwary. The Dragon Reborn had knelt before the Crystal Throne, and the omen of peach blossoms—the most powerful omen she knew—had accompanied him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroops marched past, officers shouting orders in time to the steps. The raken calls seemed timed to the beats of the falling feet. This was what she would be leaving for an unknown war in lands she barely knew. Her lands here would be virtually undefended, a foreigner of newly minted loyalty in command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat change. Her decisions could end her rule and, indeed, the Empire itself. Matrim did not understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummon my consort, Fortuona signed, tapping the armrest of her throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelucia Voiced the order to a messenger. After a short time, Mat rode up on his horse. He had refused the gift of a new one, with good reason. He had a better eye for horseflesh than the Imperial stablemaster herself. Still. Pips. What a silly name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona stood up. Immediately, those nearby bowed. Galgan dismounted and went down on his knees. Everyone else prostrated themselves to the ground. The Empress standing to proclaim meant an act of the Crystal Throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood and ashes\", Matrim said. \"More bowing? Have you folks nothing better to do? I could think of a few dozen things, if you cant\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the side, she saw Galgan smile. He thought he knew what she was going to do. He was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I name you Knotai, for you are a bringer of destruction to the Empire’s enemies. Let your new name only be spoken from now into eternity, Knotai. I proclaim that Knotai, Prince of the Ravens, is to be given the rank of Rodholder in our armies. Let it be published as my will\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRodholder. It meant that should Galgan fall, Mat would have command. Galgan was no longer smiling. He would have to keep watch over his shoulder lest Mat overcome him and take control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knotai?\" Knotai said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him. Keep your tongue, for once, she thought at him. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kind of like it\", Knotai said, turning his horse and trotting away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalgan regained his saddle. \"He will need to learn to kneel\", the general muttered, then kicked his horse forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an ever-so-small offense, deliberate and calculating. Galgan had not addressed the words to Fortuona directly, instead acting as if they were just a comment to himself. He sidestepped calling her Greatest One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was enough to make Selucia growl softly and wiggle her fingers in a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Fortuona signed, we need him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, Knotai did not seem to realize what she had done, and the risk inherent in it. Galgan would have to consult with him on their battle plans; the Rodholder could not be left out of meetings, as he had to be ready to take control at any moment. Galgan would have to listen to his advice and incorporate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bet upon her prince in this, hoping that he could manifest again the unexpected genius in battle that had so impressed Furyk Karede.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is bold, Selucia said. But what if he fails?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will not fail, Fortuona replied, for this is the Last Battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pattern had placed Knotai before her, had shoved her into his arms. The Dragon Reborn had seen and spoken truth about her—for all the illusion of order, her rule was like a heavy rock balanced on its smallest point. She was stretched thin, reigning over lands unaccustomed to discipline. She needed to take great risks \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-147.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
