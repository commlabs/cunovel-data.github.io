Trisha giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s funny?\" Mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just me thinks,\" Trisha replied, and Quilla frowned -\u0026nbsp; \"me thinks\" was a Larry McFarland-ism. Well let her frown, Trisha thought. Let her frown all she wants. I\u0027m with her, and I don\u0027t complain about it like old grouchy there, but he\u0027s still my Dad and I still love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrisha touched the brim of her signed cap, as if to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, kids, let\u0027s go,\" Quilla said. \"And keep your eyes open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate this,\" Pete almost groaned - it was the first clearly articulated thing he\u0027d said since they got out of the van, and Trisha thought: Please God, send something. A deer or a dinosaur or a UFO. Because if You don\u0027t, they\u0027re going right back at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod sent nothing but a few mosquito scouts that would no doubt soon be reporting back to the main army that fresh meat was on the move, and by the time they passed a sign reading NO. CONWAY STATION 5. 5 MI., the two of them were at it full-bore again, ignoring the woods, ignoring her, ignoring everything but each other. Yatata-yatata-yatata. It was, Trisha thought, like some sick kind of making out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a shame, too, because they were missing stuff that was actually pretty neat. The sweet, resiny smell of the pines, for instance, and the way the clouds seemed so close - less like clouds than like draggles of whitish-gray smoke. She guessed you\u0027d have to be an adult to call some-thing as boring as walking one of your hobbies, but this really wasn\u0027t bad. She didn\u0027t know if the entire Appalachian Trail was as well-maintained as this - probably not - but if it was, she guessed she could understand why people with nothing better to do decided to walk all umpty-thousand miles of it. Trisha thought it was like walking on a broad, winding avenue through the woods. It wasn\u0027t paved, of course, and it ran steadily uphill, but it was easy enough walking. There was even a little hut with a pump inside it and a sign which read: WATER TESTS OK FOR DRINKING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePLEASE FILL PRIMER JUG FOR NEXT PERSON.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a bottle of water in her pack - a big one with a squeeze-top - but suddenly all Trisha wanted in the world was to prime the pump in the little hut and get a drink, cold and fresh, from its rusty lip. She would drink and pretend she was Bilbo Baggins, on his way to the Misty Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom?\" she asked from behind them. \"Could we stop long enough to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making friends is a job, Peter,\" her mother was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look back at Trisha. \"You can\u0027t just stand around and wait for kids to come to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom? Pete? Could we please stop for just a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" he said heatedly. \"You don\u0027t have a clue. I don\u0027t know how things were when you were in junior high, but they\u0027re a lot different now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pete? Mom? Mommy? There\u0027s a pump - \" Actually there was a pump; that was now the grammatically correct way to put it, because the pump was behind them, and get-ting farther behind all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t accept that,\" Mom said briskly, all business, and Trisha thought: No wonder she drives him crazy. Then, resent-fully: They don\u0027t even know I\u0027m here. The Invisible Girl, that\u0027s me. I might as well have stayed home. A mosquito whined in her ear and she slapped at it irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to a fork in the trail. The main branch - not quite as wide as an avenue now, but still not bad - went off to the left, marked by a sign reading NO. CONWAY 5. 2. The other branch, smaller and mostly overgrown, read KEZAR NOTCH 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys, I have to pee,\" said The Invisible Girl, and of course neither of them took any notice; they just headed up the branch which led to North Conway, walking side by side like lovers and looking into each other\u0027s faces like lovers and arguing like the bitterest enemies. We should have stayed home, Trisha thought. They could have done this at home, and I could have read a book. The Hobbit again, maybe - a story about guys who like to walk in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares, I\u0027m peeing,\" she said sulkily, and walked a little way down the path marked KEZAR NOTCH. Here the pines which had stayed modestly back from the main trail crowded in, reaching with their blueblack branches, and there was underbrush, as well - clogs and clogs of it. She looked for the shiny leaves that meant poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac, and didn\u0027t see any... thank God for small favors. Her mother had shown her pictures of those and taught her to identify them two years ago, when life had been happier and simpler. In those days Trisha had gone tramping in the woods with her mother quite a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Pete\u0027s bitterest complaint about the trip to Plant-A-Torium was that their mother had wanted to go there. The obvious truth of this seemed to blind him to how selfish he had sounded, harping on it all day long.) On one of their walks, Mom had also taught her how girls peed in the woods. She began by saying, \"The most important thing - maybe the only important thing - is not to do it in a patch of poison ivy. Now look. Watch me and do it just the way I do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrisha now looked both ways, saw no one, and decided she\u0027d get off the trail anyway. The way to Kezar Notch looked hardly used - little more than an alley compared to the broad thoroughfare of the main trail - but she still didn\u0027t want to squat right in the middle of it. It seemed indecorous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped off the path in the direction of the North Conway fork, and she could still hear them arguing. Later on, after she was good and lost and trying not to believe she might die in the woods, Trisha would remember the last phrase she got in the clear; her brother\u0027s hurt, indignant voice:\u0026nbsp; - don\u0027t know why we have to pay for what you guys did wrong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked half a dozen steps toward the sound of his voice, stepping carefully around a clump of brambles even though she was wearing jeans instead of shorts. She paused, looked back, and realized she could still see the Kezar Notch path... which meant that anyone coming along it would be able to see her, squatting and peeing with a half-loaded knapsack on her back and a Red Sox cap on her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm-bare-ASS-ing, as Pepsi might say (Quilla Andersen had once remarked that Penelope Robichaud\u0027s picture should be next to the word vulgar in the dictionary).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrisha went down a mild slope, her sneakers slipping a little in a carpet of last year\u0027s dead leaves, and when she got to the bottom she couldn\u0027t see the Kezar Notch path any-more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. From the other direction, straight ahead through the woods, she heard a man\u0027s voice and a girl\u0027s answering laughter - hikers on the main trail, and not far away, by the sound. As Trisha unsnapped her jeans it occurred to her that if her mother and brother paused in their oh-so-interesting argument, looking behind them to see how sis was doing, and saw a strange man and woman instead, they might be worried about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood! Give them something else to think about for a few min-utes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething besides themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trick, her mother had told her on that better day in the woods two years ago, wasn\u0027t going outdoors - girls could do that every bit as well as boys - but to do it without soaking your clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrisha held onto the conveniently jutting branch of a nearby pine, bent her knees, then reached between her legs with her free hand, yanking her pants and her underwear forward and out of the firing line. For a moment nothing happened - wasn\u0027t that just typical - and Trish sighed. A mosquito whined bloodthirstily around her left ear, and she had no hand free with which to slap at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh waterless cookware!\" she said angrily, but it was funny, really quite deliciously stupid and funny, and she began to laugh. As soon as she started laughing she started peeing. When she was done she looked around dubiously for something to blot with and decided - once more it was her father\u0027s phrase - not to push her luck. She gave her tail a little shake (as if that would really do any good) and then yanked up her pants. When the mosquito buzzed the side of her face again, she slapped it briskly and looked with satis-faction at the small bloody smear in the cup of her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought I was unloaded, partner, didn\u0027t you?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrisha turned back toward the slope, and then turned around again as the worst idea of her life came to her. This idea was to go forward instead of backtracking to the Kezar Notch trail. The paths had forked in a Y; she would simply walk across the gap and rejoin the main trail. Piece of cake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no chance of getting lost, because she could hear the voices of the other hikers so clearly. There was really no chance of getting lost at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond Inning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE WEST SIDE of the ravine in which Trisha had taken her rest-stop was considerably steeper than the side she had come down. She climbed it with the aid of several trees, got to the top, and headed over more even ground in the direc-tion the voices had come from. There was a lot of under-brush, though, and she swerved around several thorny, close-packed patches of it. At each swerve she kept her eyes pointed in the direction of the main trail. She walked in this fashion for ten minutes or so, then stopped. In that tender place between her chest and her stomach, the place where all the body\u0027s wires seemed to come together in a clump, she felt the first minnowy flutter of disquiet. Shouldn\u0027t she have come to the North Conway branch of the Appalachian Trail by now? It certainly seemed so; she hadn\u0027t gone far down the Kezar Notch branch, probably not more than fifty paces (surely no more than sixty, seventy at the very most), and so the gap between the two diverging arms of the Y couldn\u0027t be very big, could it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened for voices on the main trail, but now the woods were silent. Well, that wasn\u0027t true. She could hear 27. the sough of the wind through the big old west-country pines, she could hear the squawk of a jay and the far-off hammering of a woodpecker digging his midmorning snack out of a hollow tree, she could hear a couple of freshly arrived mosquitoes (they were buzzing around both ears now), but no human voices. It was as if she were the only person in all these big woods, and although that was ridicu-lous, the minnow fluttered in that hollow place once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little more strongly this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrisha started walking forward again, faster now, wanting to get to the trail, wanting the relief of the trail. She came to a great fallen tree, too high to climb over, and decided to wriggle under it instead. She knew the smart thing would be to go around, but what if she lost her bearings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve already lost them, a voice in her head whispered - a terrible cold voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, I have not, you shut up,\" she whispered back, and dropped to her knees. There was a hollow running beneath one section of the moss-caked old trunk, and Trisha squirmed into it. The leaves lining it were wet, but by the time she realized this the front of her shirt was already soaked through and she decided it didn\u0027t matter. She wrig-gled further and her pack hit the trunk of the tree - thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn and blast!\" she whispered (damn and blast was her and Pepsi\u0027s current favorite swear - it sounded so English country-house, somehow) and backed up. She got to her knees, brushed clinging damp leaves from her shirt, and noticed as she did that her fingers were trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not scared,\" she said, speaking out loud on purpose because the sound of her voice whispering was freaking her out a little. \"Not scared a bit. The trail\u0027s right there. I\u0027ll be on it in five minutes, and running to catch up.\" She took off her pack and, pushing it ahead of her, began to crawl under the tree again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway out, something moved under her. She looked down and saw a fat black snake slithering through the leaves. For a moment every thought in her mind disap-peared into a silent white explosion of revulsion and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin turned to ice and her throat closed. She could not even think the single word snake but only feel it, coldly puls-ing under her warm hand. Trisha shrieked and tried to bolt to her feet, forgetting that she wasn\u0027t yet in the clear. A stump of branch thick as an amputated forearm poked ago-nizingly into the small of her back. She went flat on her stomach again and wriggled out from under the tree as fast as she could, probably looking a bit like a snake herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nasty thing was gone, but her terror lingered. It had been right under her hand, hidden in the dead leaves and right under her hand. Evidently not a biter, thank God. But what if there were more? What if they were poisonous?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the woods were full of them? And of course they were, the woods were full of everything you didn\u0027t like, everything you were afraid of and instinctively loathed, everything that tried to overwhelm you with nasty, no-brain panic. Why had she ever agreed to come? Not only agreed but agreed cheerfully?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snagged the strap of her pack in one hand and hur-ried on with it banging against her leg, casting mistrustful looks back at the fallen tree and the leafy spaces between the standing ones, afraid of seeing the snake, even more afraid that she might see a whole battalion of them, like snakes in a horror movie, Invasion of the Killer Snakes, star-ring Patricia McFarland, the riveting tale of a little girl lost in the woods and -\u0026nbsp; \"I am not l - \" Trisha began, and then, because she was looking back over her shoulder, she tripped on a rock stick-ing out of the mulchy earth, staggered, waved the arm not holding her pack in a doomed effort to keep her balance, and then fell heavily on her side. This sent up a flare of pain from her lower back, where the stump of branch had jabbed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay on her side in the leaves (damp, but not all nasty-squelchy like the ones in the hollow beneath the fallen tree), breathing fast, feeling a pulse throb between her eyes. She was suddenly, dismally aware that she didn\u0027t know if she was going in the right direction anymore or not. She had kept looking back over her shoulder, and she might not be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo back to the tree, then. The fallen tree. Stand where you came out from underneath and look straight ahead and that\u0027s the direc-tion you want to go in, the direction of the main trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was it? If so, how come she hadn\u0027t come to the main trail already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears prickled the corners of her eyes. Trisha blinked them back savagely. If she started to cry, she wouldn\u0027t be able to tell herself she wasn\u0027t frightened. If she started to cry, anything might happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked slowly back to the fallen, moss-plated tree, hating to go in the wrong direction even for a few seconds, hating to go back to where she had seen the snake (poison-ous or not, she loathed them), knowing she had to. She spotted the divot in the leaves where she\u0027d been when she saw (and - oh God - felt) the snake, a girl-length smutch on the floor of the forest. It was already filling up with water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at it, she rubbed a hand dispiritedly down the front of her shirt again - all damp and muddy. That her shirt should be damp and muddy from crawling under a tree was somehow the most alarming thing so far. It suggested that there had been a change of plan... and when the new plan included crawling through soggy hollows under fallen trees, the change was not for the better. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon/page-2.html","bookId":2578,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM"}
