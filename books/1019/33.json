{"id":23056,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. MARK ELUDES HIS PURSUERS.","content":"Little Jack had been fitted with a pair of shoes, and Mark had settled for them, when the little boy chancing to look towards the entrance of the store, was almost paralyzed by the sight of Peggy and Lyman looking in at the window. His eyes were good, and he could read on Peggy\u0027s face a malicious exultation, which boded ill for him when he should again find himself in her clutches.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark, who had not seen them, noticed the fear upon the face of his little charge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter, Jack?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s them!\" answered Jack, hoarsely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s them?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Peggyâ€”and the gentleman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are they?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Looking in at the winder.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark had his wits about him, and did not turn round. He wished Peggy and her confederate to think themselves undiscovered, while he rapidly considered what was best to be done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Should he leave the store by the front door, Jack would at once be pounced upon by Peggy, and there would be a scene.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He might eventually recover Jack, but in the meantime the boy would be ill-treated, stripped of his good clothes, and perhaps carried out of the city. Just as success seemed assured, he was confronted by defeat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What was to be done?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark was not a boy to give in, unless compelled to do so. An idea came to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jack,\" he said in a low voice, \"don\u0027t look towards the window again. Don\u0027t let them know you have seen them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You won\u0027t let Peggy get hold of me!\" said the boy in a trembling voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not if I can help it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Turning to the salesman who had waited upon him, Mark said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There are some people at the door that I want to avoid meeting. Is there any back entrance to the store?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" answered the clerk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you be kind enough to guide us to it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t look behind you, Jack, but come with me. Don\u0027t be alarmed!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The salesman guided them to a door opening on a narrow street. Boxes of goods were so piled up, that this door could not be seen from the window into which Peggy and Lyman were looking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are they going?\" Peggy asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To look at some goods in the back part of the store,\" answered Lyman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This reassured Peggy, who kept her position, feeling sure that Jack could not escape her when he came out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll sell his new clothes,\" she thought complacently. \"I\u0027ll be in luck after all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once out of the store, Mark looked about him. He felt that it behooved him to get beyond the reach of Jack\u0027s pursuers as soon as possible. Circumstances favored him. Just at the head of the street, he saw a lady descend from a hack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hurry up, Jack,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll get into this cab.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The driver was about to drive away, after settling with his fare, when Mark hailed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you unengaged?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you drive me at once to the union Depot in Van Buren Street?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He dismounted from the box, opened the door for his next passengers, and they got in. Then resuming his place on the box, he drove rapidly away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It so chanced that he passed by the front of the very store from which they had just emerged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Little Jack stole a glance out of the window of the cab.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s Peg!\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Following his example, Mark also caught sight of the two with their faces glued to the window, still looking in, unconscious that their prey had escaped them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark smiled. He felt like a victor, and rather enjoyed the thought of having outgeneraled the fox.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope they\u0027ll have a good time watching for us, Jack,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The little boy still felt nervous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think they\u0027ll catch me?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Jack, I think they\u0027ll get left this time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cab made its way rapidly through the crowded streets, and in a very short time drew up at the union Depot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark paid the driver, and accompanied by Jack, made his way to the ticket office.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How soon will there be a train East?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In ten minutes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That will suit us, Jack.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He bought tickets, and, the cars being ready, they took their seats in a comfortable car of the Lake Shore and Michigan Railroad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If they should come here!\" suggested Jack, nervously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They would have to run fast, if our train leaves on time. There is no danger, Jack. Even if they suspect that we have left the store, they wouldn\u0027t know where we are gone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still, even Mark felt relieved and reassured when the signal was given and the long train began to steam out of the depot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to go back and bid Peggy good-by?\" he asked, jocosely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope I shall never see Peggy again,\" answered the little boy, shuddering.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you ever do, there won\u0027t be any danger of her doing you any harm. Your grandfather will take care of that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In his hurry to leave the city, Mark had been compelled to leave his bill at the hotel unpaid, but his valise was left behind as security. At the first opportunity he telegraphed to the land-lord, promising to remit the necessary money, and asking him to hold the valise till instructed where to send it by express.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We will now go back to Peggy and Lyman, who were impatiently maintaining their watch at the window of the shoe store.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When fifteen minutes had passed, and Jack and Mark did not appear, they became alarmed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are they?\" muttered Peggy. \"It\u0027s long enough they are stayin\u0027.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are right, Peggy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then a policeman tapped him on the shoulder. He had been watching them for some time and their conduct seemed to him suspicious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you doing here, my man?\" he asked, suspiciously. \"You had better move on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are waiting for some one to come out,\" answered Lyman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How long do you mean to wait? Is this woman with you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" answered Lyman, reluctantly, for he was not proud of his companion, whose appearance was hardly calculated to do him credit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shure, my little bye has been shtole,\" she put in, \"and he\u0027s in the store now wid the man that shtole him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you\u0027d better go in and claim him instead of standing here and blocking up the sidewalk.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I will follow your advice,\" said Lyman. \"Will you be kind enough to stay here a minute, in case I need your help?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well; only be quick.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman entered the store, and failing to see Jack and Mark, addressed one of the salesmen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Two boys were in here a short time since,\" he said; \"one large one and one small one. Can you tell me where they are?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It happened that the salesman addressed was the same one who had guided the boys to the back entrance. At least fifteen minutes had elapsed, and there would be no danger in telling the truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They went away some time since,\" he answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They did not go out the front door, for I\u0027ve been there all the time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s another door,\" quietly retorted the clerk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where?\" asked Lyman, in dismay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the rear of the store.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sold, by thunder!\" exclaimed Lyman, under his breath. \"How long have they been gone?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fifteen minutes. Were they friends of yours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The small boy was my son,\" answered Lyman, unblushingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And was the woman I saw with you at the window his mother?\" asked the salesman, with a smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly not,\" answered Lyman, coloring with indignation. \"The older boy has abducted him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why didn\u0027t you come in sooner, then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish I had.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Great was Peggy\u0027s dismay when Lyman told her what he had learned. She had fully decided to beat Jack soundly, and now she was baffled of her revenge. The two confederates spent the rest of the day in wandering about the streets of Chicago in search of Jack and his friend, but their search was in vain.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53055.html","bookId":1019,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM"}
