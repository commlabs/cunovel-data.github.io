He tried to pat Isabel’s faux hawk. She shook him off with a good-natured glare and a threatened punch that had Baz on his knees in mock terror. “Mercy,” he cried in a high voice. Then he winked. “Or not. I like it either way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roll of her eyes Isabel opened our Europe on the Cheap travel guidebook and pointed to a section entitled “Haunted Europe” that gave bulleted info about off-the-beaten-path places that were supposedly cursed in some way: castles built out of human bones, villages that once hunted and burned witches, ancient burial grounds, and caves where vampires lurked. Werewolf or succubus hot spots—that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn tickled Isabel and grabbed the book away. “How about this one?” He read aloud, “‘Necuratul. Town of the Damned. In the Middle Ages Necuratul suffered from a series of misfortunes: a terrible drought, persecution from brutal enemies, and the Black Death. And then suddenly, in the fifteenth century, their troubles stopped. Necuratul prospered. It escaped all disease and repelled enemy attacks with ease. It was rumored that the people of Necuratul had made a pact with the devil in exchange for their good fortune and survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Over the past century Necuratul’s fortunes have dwindled. Isolated by dense forest and forgotten by industrialization, most of its young people leave for the excitement of the cities and universities as soon as they can. But they return for the village’s festival day, August 13, in which Necuratul honors its past through various rituals, culminating in a Mardi Gras–like party complete with delicious food and strong drink. (Necuratul is famed for its excellent wines as well as its supposed disreputable history.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Sadly, this may be the last year for the festival—and Necuratul itself—as there are plans to relocate the town and build a power plant in its location.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow. There’s a happy travelogue,” Baz cracked. “Come to our town! Drink our wine! Ogle our women! Feast on our feast days! And all it will cost you is…your soul!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve got great wine and a hellacious party? I’m there,” John said. He still had his expensive sunglasses perched on his head. His nose was sunburned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaz drained his stein and wiped his mouth on his arm. “I’m in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too. Poe?” Isabel held out her hand to me and grinned. It was always hard to resist Izzie when she was being adventurous. We’d been best friends since seventh grade when she’d immigrated from Haiti and I’d arrived from the big city, and we’d held on to each other like buoys lost on a dark, uncertain sea. I laced my fingers through hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Town of the Damned it is,” I said, and we all shook on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning we left the hostel before dawn and caught a train headed east from Munich. The train chugged around mountains with steep drop-offs that made the still-hungover John and Baz sick to their stomachs. After a few more twists and turns we disappeared into a deep, dark forest—a towering guard of ancient power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t last a day in there,” I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, no one would,” John said. He pulled his hat over his face to block the light and went to sleep against Isabel’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Budapest there was an influx of travelers, and our cozy cabin was invaded by an old lady with a smell like garlic and an accent dense as brown bread. “I am sitting here, yes? You will make room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel and John were still asleep on the bench opposite us, so Baz and I scooted over, and the old lady sat down and spread out next to us. “Where are you going? No, wait! Don’t tell me. I guess. You’re going to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Necuratul. Town of the Damned,” Baz interrupted. He wiggled his eyebrows for effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady grunted. “I said I would guess. I am a fortune-teller. When stupid American boys don’t beat me to the fist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean ‘to the punch’?” Baz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever. You are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe introduced ourselves and she nodded like she had mulled it over and decided it was okay for us to have our particular names. “You may call me Mrs. Smith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow Mrs. Smith didn’t seem like the name of an Eastern European fortune-teller who smelled of garlic and got on at Budapest. I guess our faces gave it away, because she gave us a little shrug. “It was easy to paint on my truck. Besides, everybody knows someone named Smith. Come. I will tell your fortunes.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-55.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
