Please let someone save him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce my father downed the vodka he heaved himself out of the Jacuzzi and lurched toward a towel lying on a chaise longue. After drying off he removed the bathing suit and draped it over the chaise. He wrapped the towel around himself and then moved unsteadily into the house, leaving a trail of wet, fading footprints on the concrete patio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera paused and then raced around the corner and did something I was praying it would not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt went into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt moved through the kitchen. And then down a hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stopped suddenly when it caught sight of my father dragging himself up the stairs to the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when my father turned and kept climbing, his back to the camera, the camera started creeping up the stairs behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were clamped over my ears, and I kept kicking the floor of my office involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera stopped when it reached the second-story landing. It watched as my father entered the bathroom, a large marble space steeped in light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was now crying wildly, pounding my knee as I watched, helplessly transfixed. “What is happening?” I kept moaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera then crossed the hallway and stopped again. It had a vague and maddening patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father stared at his frail visage in a giant mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the camera slowly began moving toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was aware that it was about to reveal itself to him, and my entire body shuddered with dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was now closer to him than it had ever been. It was directly outside the bathroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I noticed something that had been nagging gently at whatever part of myself wasn’t preoccupied with the shock of the video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of the screen, on the right, in digital numbers: 2:38 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes instinctively darted to the other side of the screen. 08/10/92.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the night my father died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the sounds of his sobbing brought me out of the stunned darkness that had instantly covered everything. This was a new dimension now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking, I refocused on the screen, unable to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father gripped the bathroom counter, still sobbing. I wanted to avert my eyes when I saw an empty vodka bottle lying next to the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom somewhere in the house, “The Sunny Side of the Street” began playing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera kept floating closer. It was now in the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was closing in on my father indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifled a scream when I saw that there was no reflection of the camera or who was behind it in any of the mirrors that walled the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then my father stopped sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he straightened up and turned around to fully face the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into its lens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera was an invitation to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father was now looking directly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled sadly. There was no fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said one word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Robby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as the camera rushed toward him, he said it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe video collapsed into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anticlimax of not seeing what happened to my father at the moment of his death forced me to rewind the video to a crucial point that I believed could help me understand what I had just seen and suddenly my movements were calm and purposeful and I was able to concentrate solely on what I needed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I did not think there was a camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now I can’t explain the logic of this, but I did not believe there was a camera in my father’s house that night in August of 1992.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(There had been “certain irregularities,” according to the coroner’s report.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the image of my father standing in the kitchen, with the camera watching him through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I located immediately what I thought was the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small, flesh-colored image in the corner of the video, in the lower right-hand quadrant of the screen. It was the reflection of a face in window glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt moved in and out of focus even though the image of my father remained steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no camera videotaping this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was seeing something through the eyes of a person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enlarged the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed Pause and enlarged the image again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face became clearer without the overall image being distorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enlarged the image once more and then stopped because I didn’t have to anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought the face reflected in the window was mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one moment the video showed me that I had been there that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the face wasn’t mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were black, and the face belonged to Clayton. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-81.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
