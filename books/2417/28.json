You think you can afford to wait around for a better offer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam\u0027s smile dissolved. \"Get the fuck out, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should talk to me, Cam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went across the room, retrieved his .22 from the guitar amp. He held it lazily in my direction, never mind the chambers were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t much more I could say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door. The heat immediately sucked into the room around me, along with the traffic sounds and the smell of exhaust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I left, Cam Compton was standing in front of his music collection, his .22 wedged in his armpit. Cam was examining one by one the stray CDs I\u0027d taken out, using his grubby Tshirt to wipe the front of each jewel case before he put it back in its proper place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night it took more than a little self convincing to get myself out of the house, away from the possibilities of a simple chalupa dinner and my medieval drama book and maybe even some sleep, to drive out instead to the address Miranda Daniels had given me—her family ranch house near Bulverde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been less than a year since an inheritance case had taken me out that direction, but I was amazed by the urbanization, how much farther I had to go to start smelling the cedars and the fertilizer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSan Antonio grows in concentric layers like a tree. It\u0027s one of the few ways the town is orderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandfather rarely went farther from downtown than Brackenridge Park, unless he was looking for deer to shoot. My mother used to think Scrivener\u0027s fabric store on Loop 410 was the edge of town. In my high school years the outermost boundary of the known world was Loop 1604, and even inside the loop it was still mostly tracts of live oak and cactus and broken limestone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I could drive past 1604 and halfway to the village of Bulverde before I was ever out of earshot of a convenience store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky behind me was city grayorange and ahead of me rural black. Just above the hills, the full moon made a hazy white circle behind the clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exited on Ranch Road 22, a narrow twolaner with no lighting, no posted speed limits, plenty of curves, and nothing on the shoulders but gravel and barbed wire. A killway, my dad would\u0027ve called it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my goreloving adolescent days I used to pester the Sheriff to tell me about all the traffic accidents he\u0027d handled on little ranch roads like RR22. He usually said no, but one night he\u0027d gotten drunk enough and fed up enough to tell me in graphic detail about a particularly nasty headon collision. He told me murder scenes were nothing compared to car accidents, and then he went on to prove it. I never asked to hear any more of his work stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swerved once to avoid a dead deer. Fence posts and mile markers floated into my headlights and out again. Occasionally I passed a billboard advertising a new housing development that was about to be built—CALLE VERDE, FINE LIVING FROM THE 120\u0027s. I bet the folks who\u0027d moved out here for a retirement in the country were pleased about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 7Elevens and H.E.B.s would be coming in next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe turn for Serra Road was unmarked, despite what Miranda had told me, and it wasn\u0027t much wider than a private driveway. Fortunately I could see the Daniels\u0027 party all the way from RR22. A quarter mile or so across a dark pasture, lights were blazing in the trees and a fire was burning. There was the distant hum of music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bumped along Serra Road with rocks pinging into the wheel wells of the VW. The air was the temperature of bathwater and had a strange mix of smells— manure, wood smoke, gasoline, and marigolds. One more right turn took me over the cattle guard of the Daniels\u0027 property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir front yard was a full acre of gravel and grass. A dozen pickup trucks were parked around a granddaddy live oak several stories tall and hung from root to top with white Christmas lights. One of the pickup trucks was a huge black affair with orange pinstriping and silver Barbie doll women on the mud flaps. I wondered if there could be two such trucks in the world. Not with my luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house itself was low and long and white, with a front porch that stretched all the way across and was now spilling over with people. Willis Daniels and his standup bass were the centre of attention. He and a small bunch of grizzled cowboy musicians, none of them from Miranda\u0027s group, were burning their way through an old swing number—Milton Brown, if my memories of my father\u0027s 78 collection served me right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the players were drunk as hell and they sounded just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmaller clumps of people were gathered around the property, drinking and talking and laughing. Half a dozen were throwing horseshoes by the side of the house, their light provided by a line of bare bulbs strung between a mesquite tree and a toolshed. Some women in dresses and boots and lots of silver jewellery were gathered around a campfire, helping blearyeyed kids roast marsh mallows. All of the pickup truck cabs were dark and closed but not all of them were vacant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to the oak tree two men were talking—Brent Daniels and my buddy Jean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent was wearing the same dingy checkered shirt and black jeans he\u0027d been wearing the last three times I\u0027d seen him. They weren\u0027t getting any prettier and neither was he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis black hair looked like dayold road kill. He was shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean wore a dark blue linen jacket, slacks that were a little too tight around his middle, a white collarless silk shirt, black boots, and a silver bracelet. His hand was clutching Brent\u0027s shoulder a little too firmly and he was leaning close to Brent\u0027s ear, telling him something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jean realized somebody was watching their conversation he cast around until he found me. He locked his fierce, indifferent little eyes on me for a second, finished his statement to Brent, then pulled away and laughed, patting Brent\u0027s shoulder like they\u0027d just shared a fine humorous story. Brent didn\u0027t laugh. He turned angrily and walked toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean leaned back against the oak. He put his heel on the trunk, produced a handrolled cigarette, and began fishing around his pockets for a lighter. He watched me as I walked toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The steel guitar player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s honest work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean lit his cigarette, nodded. \"No doubt. Honest work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you standing out here in the dark?\" I asked. \"Your boss too embarrassed to bring you into the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean narrowed his eyes. He mouthed the words your boss like he was trying to interpret them, like he was suspicious he\u0027d just been insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheckly,\" he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah—the big ugly redneck. You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the glow from the white Christmas lights, Jean\u0027s smile looked unnaturally luminous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fierceness in his eyes didn\u0027t diminish at all. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did a hell of a job clearing out Alex Blanceagle the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response. Jean took a drag on the cigarette, turned his head, and blew smoke leisurely toward the porch. The old drunk musicians had launched into something new—an instrumental that sounded vaguely like Lester Scruggs. A couple of women were dosidoing with each other on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked toward the front door. Brent Daniels now stood next to an icefilled garbage can, drinking a beer as fast as he could. Several people were talking to him but Brent wasn\u0027t paying them any attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that about?\" I asked Jean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed my gaze, caught my meaning. \"I told Brent Daniels I admired his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer music. I said I hoped she would tour Europe soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Cam Compton used to. Make a nice courier system, wouldn\u0027t it? Good cover, touring with a band, with lots of equipment, if you had goods you wanted to deliver to a lot of places in Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean blew more smoke. He gave me the crab eyes. \"Do you intend to provoke, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre, or are you simply an idiot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not usually like this,\" I confessed. \"Usually I don\u0027t find so many corpses in one week. You usually leave so many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean smiled coldly. \"An idiot,\" he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe disengaged his back from the tree and was leaning forward to say something when some commotion erupted around the side of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody by the shed yelled \"Ohhh!\" like he\u0027d just seen a great triple play. A woman shrieked. A crowd of people started to converge around the horseshoe pit. Some were swearing, a few laughing. Willis Daniels\u0027 hoe down faltered to a stop as the musicians got up to see what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA drunk cowboy staggered away from the scene, laughing, telling people what had just happened in a loud enough voice that Jean and I could hear him fine. Apparently Allison SaintPierre had just knocked Tilden Sheckly out cold with a horseshoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed his cigarette down in a leisurely way. It bounced off a root and disappeared in the crack between two other roots, then dimmed to a little orange eye. Jean looked up at me and smiled, almost pleasantly this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boss,\" he said with satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned and casually walked in the opposite direction, into the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheckly wasn\u0027t out cold, exactly. Just slightly cooled down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged my way through the spectators and found him sitting in the dust, his fingertips on his temples and a look of complete dismay on his face. He was dressed in black from boots to shirt. His Stetson lay nearby, knocked from his head. Below Sheck\u0027s left eye, the cheek looked like a crosssection of a rare filet mignon. An inch higher and the horseshoe would\u0027ve blinded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn older woman squatted next to him, patting his shoulders and trying to console him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words came out slurred. The margarita in her other hand sloshed at a fortyfive degree angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of cowboy types stood on the other side. They seemed anxious to lend the rich man a bandanna, or an arm to lean on, or a gun to shoot Allison Saint Pierre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything he needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheckly shook his head a couple of times. He dabbed at his ruined cheek with the back of his fist, looked at the blood on his knuckles, and regained some colour in his face. Then he tried to get up and failed. He rallied again, staggering to his feet with the help of the cowboys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna kill that crazy bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men murmured agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheckly blinked. He stumbled, huge and awkward as a drugged horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned the crowd, targeted me briefly, and seemed to make a foggy connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his eyes kept moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison SaintPierre was nowhere to be seen, though a few people were looking in the direction of the ranch house and shaking their heads as they speculated about her. I went toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I bumped into Willis Daniels on the porch he turned around and grabbed my upper arm and for a second I thought the old man was going to clobber me with his cane. I hardly recognized him. The Santa Claus smile had vanished. His eyes blazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cement coloured hair was flattened into sweaty bangs against his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked disappointed when he saw I wasn\u0027t someone he wanted to clobber. At least not at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it,\" he muttered, lowering his cane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allison went this way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillis raised his cane again and shook it at nobody in particular. Then he glared in the direction of the horseshoe pit and began grumbling things about Mrs. Saint Pierre that weren\u0027t fit for Santa\u0027s elves to hear. I went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStringed instruments decorated the walls. A couple of kids slept on a Naugahyde couch in the living room while their parents told Aggie jokes and mixed drinks in the kitchen. The door to the first bedroom down the hall was open. A woman I didn\u0027t know had passed out on the bed in the middle of a pile of cowboy hats. The door to the second bedroom was ajar and Allison\u0027s voice came through in a tone so shaky it made me wince—like an Estring tuned to the point you just knew it was going to snap in the guitarist\u0027s face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-28.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
