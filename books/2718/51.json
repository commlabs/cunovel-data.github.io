I be right there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you met Dr. X once before,” I say. “Do you know where he is now? Where I can find him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior Webster purses his lips. “I might could help you with that. But first I got a show to do. You play any music, Cameron?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Music opens your soul, makes you ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles big. “Exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow Junior Webster into the completely packed club. As Junior passes, people reach out to touch him. This is what they’ve been waiting for, a chance to hear the famous Junior Webster and his magic trumpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGonzo manages to squeeze his way through. He falls in beside me. “Dude, I’ve been waiting, like, twenty minutes next to a bowl of toxic nut mix trying not to breathe in. What happened with Junior Webster?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s gonna tell us where to find Dr. X. But he’s got to play his set first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior leads us to a stage beside huge doors that open to a balcony. Down below, it’s a surreal sight—throngs of revelers in wild costumes dancing and swaying in the street, waiting for Junior to blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Demeanor grabs the mike. “Ladies and gentlemen, the Horn and Ivory Club is proud to introduce the one, the only, Mr. Junior Webster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd whoops and hollers and chants his name. Junior puts the trumpet to his lips, but before he can blow a note, he staggers, his hand over his heart. A gasp rolls through the crowd. Junior stumbles over and grabs hold of my hand. “You feel ’im, son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feel what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior’s eyes go wide. “He’s here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking out over the gray cigarette haze, all I see is a bunch of people waiting for Junior to give them a good time. The sharp tang of some harsher smoke tickles the back of my throat, though, and cutting through the crowd is a tall figure in black spiked space armor and a shiny helmet. The visor covers his face completely. I feel weak. When I look down at my protective E-ticket wristband, the first of the five listed kingdoms—Adventureland—is starting to lose color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Wizard of Reckoning,” Junior gasps. He pats my sleeve. “Get behind me, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You come for this?” Junior waves the trumpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wizard of Reckoning moves his head slowly from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you come for, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard slides a piece of paper out from behind his armor. It could be just another one of those missing posters plastered to the crumbling walls of New Orleans. I only catch a glimpse, but I could swear it looks like the guy I saw on the Internet. Junior shakes his head hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cain’t let you do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard seems to notice me for the first time. He points one gloved finger in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir,” Junior growls, as if the wizard’s spoken. “He ain’t ready for you, yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low murmur ripples through the club. Down on the street, revelers shout for Junior. They’ve come for a show and they’re getting pissed off about the delay. The candles on the tables flare suddenly. The Wizard of Reckoning squeezes his hand into a fist, and it’s like I can’t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, all right!” Junior shouts, and the breath comes back into my body. The candles die down. “I’ll make you a deal. I know you been wantin’ my horn for a while now. I’mmo play you for it. I win, you leave in peace and don’t come back. You win, you get the horn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard cocks his head. I don’t hear him say anything, but Junior must, because his face falls, his mouth set in a grim line. “All right, then. If that’s the way it’s gotta be. I accept.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Accept what?” I ask Junior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never you mind,” Junior whispers. “If something happens to me here tonight, you take my horn with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you just said—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior’s voice is as tight as his lips. “I know what I said, son. You take this horn and someday, when you gotta, when there’s nothin’ else, you play it. You feel me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I say, not understanding at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, he hands me his dark glasses. His eyes are cloudy. “Now. You take these glasses and bury ’em under the angel and wait for a message. You need that message to keep on with your trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand. Is this about Dr. X?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s about a lot more than that, son.” He blows air over his lips, loosens them for playing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-bovine/page-51.html","bookId":2718,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM"}
