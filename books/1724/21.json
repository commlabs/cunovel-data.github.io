There were no doors to the small bottom-level rooms which doubled as prison cells, but a force field stretched from side to side, top to bottom. Biron could feel it with his hand. There was a tiny resilience to it, like rubber stretched nearly to its extreme, and then it stopped giving, as though the first initial pressure turned it to steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt tingled Biron\u0027s hand, and he knew that though it would stop matter completely, it would be as transparent as space to the energy beam of a neuronic whip. And there was a whip in the guard\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron said, \"I\u0027ve got to see Commissioner Aratap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you\u0027re making a noise about?\" The guard was not in the best of humors. The night watch was unpopular and he was losing at cards. \"I\u0027ll mention it after lights-on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t wait.\" Biron felt desperate. \"It\u0027s important. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will have to wait. Will you get back, or do you want a bit of the whip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" said Biron, \"the man with me is Gillbret oth Hinriad. He is sick. He may be dying. If a Hinriad dies on a Tyrannian ship because you will not let me speak to the man in authority, you will not have a good time of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Will you be quick or are you tired of life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard mumbled something and was off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron watched him as far as he could see in the dim purple. He strained his ears in an attempt to catch the heightened throbbing of the engines as energy concentration climbed to a pre-Jump peak, but he heard nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strode to Gillbret, seized the man\u0027s hair, and pulled his head back gently. Eyes stared into his out of a contorted face. There was no recognition in them, only fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only me-Biron. How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took time for the words to penetrate. Gillbret said, blankly, \"Biron?\" Then, with a quiver of life, \"Biron! Are they Jumping? Death won\u0027t hurt, Biron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron let the head drop. No point in anger against Gillbret. On the information he had, or thought he had, it was a great gesture. All the more so, since it was breaking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was writhing in frustration. Why wouldn\u0027t they let him speak to Aratap? Why wouldn\u0027t they let him out? He found himself at a wall and beat upon it with his fists. If there were a door, he could break it down; if there were bars, he could pull them apart or drag them out of their sockets, by the Galaxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was a force field, which nothing could damage. He yelled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were footsteps once more. He rushed to the open-yet-not-open door. He could not look out to see who was coming down the corridor. He could only wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the guard again. \"Get back from the field,\" he barked. \"Step back with your hands in front of you.\" There was an officer with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron retreated. The other\u0027s neuronic whip was on him, unwaveringly. Biron said, \"The man with you is not Aratap. I want to speak to the Commissioner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer said, \"If Gillbret oth Hinriad is ill, you don\u0027t want to see the Commissioner. You want to see a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force field was down, with a dim blue spark showing as contact broke. The officer entered, and Biron could see the Medical Group insignia on his uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron stepped in front of him. \"All right. Now listen to me. This ship mustn\u0027t Jump. The Commissioner is the only one who can see to that, and I must see him. Do you understand that? You\u0027re an officer. You can have him awakened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor put out an arm to brush Biron aside, and Biron batted it away. The doctor cried out sharply and called, \"Guard, get this man out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard stepped forward and Biron dived. They went thumping down together, and Biron clawed up along the guard\u0027s body, hand over hand, seizing first the shoulder and then the wrist of the arm that was trying to bring its whip down upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment they remained frozen, straining against one another, and then Biron caught motion at the corner of his eye. The medical officer was rushing past them to sound the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron\u0027s hand, the one not holding the other\u0027s whip wrist, shot out and seized the officer\u0027s ankle. The guard writhed nearly free, and the officer kicked out wildly at him, but, with the veins standing out on his neck and temples, Biron pulled desperately with each hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer went down; shouting hoarsely. The guard\u0027s whip clattered to the floor with a harsh sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron fell upon it, rolled with it, and came up on his knees and one hand. In his other was the whip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a sound,\" he gasped. \"Not one sound. Drop anything else you\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard, staggering to his feet, his tunic ripped, glared hatred and tossed a short, metal-weighted, plastic club away from himself. The doctor was unarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron picked up the club. He said, \"Sorry. I have nothing to tie and gag you with and no time anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whip flashed dimly once, twice. First the guard and then the doctor stiffened in agonized immobility and dropped solidly, in one piece, legs and arms bent grotesquely out from their bodies as they lay, in the attitude they had last assumed before the whip struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron turned to Gillbret, who was watching with dull, soundless vacuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" said Biron, \"but you, too, Gillbret,\" and the whip flashed a third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vacuous expression was frozen solid as Gillbret lay there on his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force field was still down and Biron stepped out into the corridor. It was empty. This was space-ship \"night\" and only the watch and the night details would be up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be no time to try to locate Aratap. It would have to be straight for the engine room. He set off. It would be toward the bow, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man in engineer\u0027s work clothes hurried past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When\u0027s the next Jump?\" called out Biron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About half an hour,\" the engineer returned over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Engine room straight ahead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And up the ramp.\" The man turned suddenly. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron did not answer. The whip flared a fourth time. He stepped over the body and went on. Half an hour left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the noise of men as he sped up the ramp. The light ahead was white, not purple. He hesitated. Then he put the whip into his pocket. They would be busy. There would be no reason for them to suspect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped in quickly. The men were pygmies scurrying about the huge matter-energy converters. The room glared with dials, a hundred thousand eyes staring their information out to all who would look. A ship this size, one almost in the class of a large passenger liner, was considerably different from the tiny Tyrannian cruiser he had been used to. There, the engines had been all but automatic. Here they were large enough to power a city, and required considerable supervision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on a railed balcony that circled the engine room. In one corner there was a small room in which two men handled computers with flying fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried in that direction, while engineers passed him without looking at him, and stepped through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two at the computers looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" one asked. \"What are you doing up here? Get back to your post.\" He had a lieutenant\u0027s stripes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron said, \"Listen to me. The hyperatomics have been shorted. They\u0027ve got to be repaired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" said the second man, \"I\u0027ve seen this man. He\u0027s one of the prisoners. Hold him, Lancy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped up and was making his way out the other door. Biron hurdled the desk and the computer, seized the belt of the controlman\u0027s tunic and pulled him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct,\" he said. \"I\u0027m one of the prisoners. I\u0027m Biron of Widemos. But what I say is true. The hyperatomics are shorted. Have them inspected, if you don\u0027t believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant found himself staring at a neuronic whip. He said, carefully, \"It can\u0027t be done, sir, without orders from Officer of the Day, or from the Commissioner. It would mean changing the Jump calculations and delaying us hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the authority, then. Get the Commissioner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I use the communicator?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant\u0027s arm reached out for the flaring mouthpiece of the communicator, and halfway there plummeted down hard upon the row of knobs at one end of his desk. Bells clamored in every corner of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron\u0027s club was too late. It came down hard upon the lieutenant\u0027s wrist. The lieutenant snatched it away, nursing it and moaning over it, but the warning signals were sounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuards were rocketing in upon the balcony through every entrance. Biron slammed out of the control room, looked in either direction, then hopped the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plummeted down, landing knees bent, and rolled. He rolled as rapidly as he could to prevent setting himself up as a target. He heard the soft hissing of a needle gun near his ear, and then he was in the shadow of one of the engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up in a crouch, huddling beneath its curve. His right leg was a stabbing pain. Gravity was high so near the ship\u0027s hull and the drop had been a long one. He had sprained his knee badly. It meant that there would be no more chase. If he Won out, it was to be from where he stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called out, \"Hold your firer I am unarmed.\" First the club and then the whip he had taken from the guard went spinning out toward the center of the engine room. They lay there in stark impotence and plain view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron shouted, \"I have come to warn you. The hyperatomics are shorted. A Jump will mean the death of us all. I ask only that you check the motors. You will lose a few hours, perhaps, if I am wrong. You will save your lives, if I am right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone called, \"Go down there and get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron yelled, \"Will you sell your lives rather than listen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the cautious sound of many feet, and shrank backward. Then there was a sound above. A soldier was sliding down the engine toward him, hugging its faintly warm skin as though it were a bride. Biron waited. He could still use his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the voice came from above, unnaturally loud, penetrating every corner of the huge room. It said, \"Back to your places. Halt preparations for the Jump. Check the hyperatomics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Aratap, speaking through the public-address system. The order then came, \"Bring the young man to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron allowed himself to be taken. There were two soldiers on each side, holding him as though they expected him to explode. He tried to force himself to walk naturally, but he was limping badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAratap was in semidress. His eyes seemed different: faded, peering, unfocused. It occurred to Biron that the man wore contact lenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAratap said, \"You have created quite a stir, Farrill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was necessary to save the ship. Send these guards away. As long as the engines are being investigated, there\u0027s nothing more I intend doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will stay just awhile. At least, until I hear from my engine men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited, silently, as the minutes dragged on, and then there was a flash of red upon the frosted-glass circle above the glowing lettering that read \"Engine Room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAratap opened contact. \"Make your report!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words that came were crisp and hurried: \"Hyperatomics on the C Bank completely shorted. Repairs under way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAratap said, \"Have Jump recalculated for plus six hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Biron and said coolly, \"You were right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured. The guards saluted, turned on their heels, and left one by one with a smooth precision. Aratap said, \"The details, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gillbret oth Hinriad during his stay in the engine room thought the shorting would be a good idea. The man is not responsible for his actions and must not be punished for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAratap nodded. \"He has not been considered responsible for years. That portion of the events will remain between you and me only. However, my interest and curiosity are aroused by your reasons for preventing the destruction of the ship. You are surely not afraid to die in a good cause?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no cause,\" said Biron. \"There is no rebellion world. I have told you so already and I repeat it. Lingane was the center of revolt, and that has been checked. I was interested only in tracking down my father\u0027s murderer, the Lady Artemisia only in escaping an unwanted marriage. As for Gillbret, he is mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet the Autarch believed in the existence of this mysterious planet. Surely he gave me the co-ordinates of something!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His belief is based on a madman\u0027s dream. Gillbret dreamed something twenty years ago. Using that as a basis, the Autarch calculated five possible planets as the site of this dream world. It is all nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commissioner said, \"And yet something disturbs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are working so hard to persuade me. Surely I will find all this out for myself once I have made the Jump. Consider that it is not impossible that in desperation one of you might endanger the ship and the other save it as a complicated method for convincing me that I need look no further for the rebellion world. I would say to myself: If there were really such a world, young Farrill would have let the ship vaporize, for he is a young man and romantically capable of dying what he would consider a hero\u0027s death. Since he has risked his life to prevent that happening, Gillbret is mad, there is no rebellion world, and I will return without searching further. Am I too complicated for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I understand you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And since you have saved our lives, you will receive appropriate consideration in the Khan\u0027s court. You will have saved your life and your cause. No, young sir, I am not quite so ready to believe the obvious. We will still make the Jump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no objections,\" said Biron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are cool,\" said Aratap. \"It is a pity you were not born one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant it as a compliment. He went on, \"We\u0027ll take you back to your cell now, and replace the force field. A simple precaution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard that Biron had knocked out was no longer there when they returned to the prison room, but the doctor was. He was bending over the still-unconscious form of Gillbret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAratap said, \"Is he still under?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his voice the doctor jumped up. \"The effects of the whip have worn off, Commissioner, but the man is not young and has been under a strain. I don\u0027t know if he will recover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron felt horror fill him. He dropped to his knees, disregarding the wrenching pain, and reached out a hand to touch Gillbret\u0027s shoulder gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gil,\" he whispered. He watched the damp, white face, anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of the way, man.\" The medical officer was scowling at him. He removed his black doctor\u0027s wallet from an inner pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least the hypodermics aren\u0027t broken,\" he grumbled. He leaned over Gillbret, the hypodermic, filled with its colorless fluid, poised. It sank deep, and the plunger pressed inward automatically. The doctor tossed it aside and they waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillbret\u0027s eyes flickered, then opened. For a while they stared unseeingly. When he spoke finally, his voice was a whisper. \"I can\u0027t see, Biron. I can\u0027t see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiron leaned close again. \"It\u0027s all right, Oil. Just rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to.\" He tried to struggle upright. \"Biron, when are. they Jumping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon, soon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay with me, then. I don\u0027t want to die alone.\" His fingers clutched feebly, and then relaxed. His head lolled backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor stooped, then straightened. \"We were too late. He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears stung at Biron\u0027s eyelids. \"I\u0027m sorry, Oil,\" he said, \"but you didn\u0027t know. You didn\u0027t understand.\" They didn\u0027t hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were hard hours for Biron. Aratap had refused to allow him to attend the ceremonies involved in the burial of a body at space. Somewhere in the ship, he knew, Gillbret\u0027s body would be blasted in an atomic furnace and then exhausted into space, where its atoms might mingle forever with the thin wisps of interstellar matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtemisia and Hinrik would be there. Would they understand? Would she understand that he had done only what he had to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor had injected the cartilaginous extract that would hasten the healing of Biron\u0027s tom ligaments, and already the pain in his knee was barely noticeable, but then that was only physical pain, anyway. It could be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the inner disturbance that meant the ship had Jumped and then the worst time came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier he had felt his own analysis to be correct. It had to be. But what if he were wrong? What if they were now at the very heart of rebellion? The information would go streaking back to Tyrann and the armada would gather. And he himself would die knowing that he might have saved the rebellion, but had risked death to ruin it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was during that dark time that he thought of the document again. The document he had once failed to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange the way the notion of the document came and went. It would be mentioned, and then forgotten. There was a mad, intensive search for the rebellion world and yet no search at all for the mysterious vanished document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the emphasis being misplaced?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to Biron then that Aratap was willing to come upon the rebellion world with a single ship. What was that confidence he had? Could he dare a planet with a ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Autarch had said the document had vanished years before, but then who had it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tyranni, perhaps. They might have a document the secret of which would allow one ship to destroy a world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that were true, what did it matter where the rebellion world was, or if it existed at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed and then Aratap entered.
