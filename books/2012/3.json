And dear Father, did you really mean this to be? Did she not abandon her consort and take you for her own? Did you not command us to peace? Did you not say to us that we children must be as one beneath the newborn sky of your union?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat crime awoke us to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t even remember .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you feel it, Aparal? The power?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I feel it, Kadagar.’ They’d moved away from the others, but not so far as to escape the agonized cries, the growl of the Hounds, or, drifting out over the broken rocks in ghostly streams, the blistering breath of cold upon their backs. Before them rose the infernal barrier. A wall of imprisoned souls. An eternally crashing wave of despair. He stared at the gaping faces through the mottled veil, studied the pitted horror in their eyes. You were no different, were you? Awkward with your inheritance, the heavy blade turning this way and that in your hand .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy should we pay for someone else’s hatred?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What so troubles you, Aparal?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We cannot know the reason for our god’s absence, Lord. I fear it is presumptuous of us to speak of his failure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKadagar Fant was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal closed his eyes. He should never have spoken. I do not learn. He walked a bloody path to rule and the pools in the mud still gleam red. The air about Kadagar remains brittle. This flower shivers to secret winds. He is dangerous, so very dangerous .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Priests spoke of impostors and tricksters, Aparal.’ Kadagar’s tone was even, devoid of inflection. It was the voice he used when furious. ‘What god would permit that? We are abandoned. The path before us now belongs to no one else – it is ours to choose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOurs. Yes, you speak for us all, even as we cringe at our own confessions . ‘Forgive my words, Lord. I am made ill – the taste—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We had no choice in that, Aparal. What sickens you is the bitter flavour of its pain. It passes.’ Kadagar smiled and clapped him on the back. ‘I understand your momentary weakness. We shall forget your doubts, yes? And never again speak of them. We are friends, after all, and I would be most distressed to be forced to brand you a traitor. Set upon the White Wall … I would kneel and weep, my friend. I would.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spasm of alien fury hissed through Aparal and he shivered. Abyss! Mane of Chaos, I feel you! ‘My life is yours to command, Lord.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lord of Light!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal turned, as did Kadagar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood streaming from his mouth, Iparth Erule staggered closer, eyes wide and fixed upon Kadagar. ‘My lord, Uhandahl, who was last to drink, has just died. He – he tore out his own throat !’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then it is done,’ Kadagar replied. ‘How many?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIparth licked his lips, visibly flinched at the taste, and then said, ‘You are the First of Thirteen, Lord.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Kadagar stepped past Iparth. ‘Kessobahn still breathes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. It is said it can bleed for centuries—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But the blood is now poison,’ Kadagar said, nodding. ‘The wounding must be fresh, the power clean. Thirteen, you say. Excellent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal stared at the dragon staked to the slope behind Iparth Erule. The enormous spears pinning it to the ground were black with gore and dried blood. He could feel the Eleint’s pain, pouring from it in waves. Again and again it tried to lift its head, eyes blazing, jaws snapping, but the vast trap held. The four surviving Hounds of Light circled at a distance, hackles raised as they eyed the dragon. Seeing them, Aparal hugged himself. Another mad gamble. Another bitter failure. Lord of Light, Kadagar Fant, you have not done well in the world beyond .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond this terrible vista, and facing the vertical ocean of deathless souls as if in mocking madness, rose the White Wall, which hid the decrepit remnants of the Liosan city of Saranas. The faint elongated dark streaks lining it, descending just beneath the crenellated battlements, were all he could make out of the brothers and sisters who had been condemned as traitors to the cause. Below their withered corpses ran the stains from everything their bodies had drained down the alabaster facing. You would kneel and weep, would you, my friend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIparth asked, ‘My lord, do we leave the Eleint as it is?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. I propose something far more fitting. Assemble the others. We shall veer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal started but did not turn. ‘Lord—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We are Kessobahn’s children now, Aparal. A new father, to replace the one who abandoned us. Osserc is dead in our eyes and shall remain so. Even Father Light kneels broken, useless and blind.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-3.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
