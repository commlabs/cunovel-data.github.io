It follows to basic plotlines -- one is the story of a desperate soldier fighting an impossible war, the other from the point of view of an ex-pirate escaped from prison who joined up with the wrong crew. The two plots do intertwine, but the plots aren\u0027t the appeal of this novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/armor.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/armor.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:09 PM"}
