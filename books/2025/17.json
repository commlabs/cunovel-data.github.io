I stared into the empty recesses, willing something suitable to appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy khaki skirt lay over the back of the rocking chair, waiting for me to discover something that went with it just exactly right. Something that would make me look beautiful and grown up. Something that said special occasion. I was coming up empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost time to go, and I was still wearing my favorite old sweats. Unless I could find something better here - and the odds weren\u0027t looking good at this point - I was going to graduate in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at the pile of clothes on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kicker was that I knew exactly what I would have worn if it were still available - my kidnapped red blouse. I punched the wall with my good hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid, thieving, annoying vampire!\" I growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I do?\" Alice demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leaning casually beside the open window as if she\u0027d been there the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knock, knock,\" she added with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it really so hard to wait for me to get the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw a flat, white box onto my bed. \"I\u0027m just passing through. I thought you might need something to wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the big package lying on top of my unsatisfying wardrobe and grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admit it,\" Alice said. \"I\u0027m a lifesaver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a lifesaver,\" I muttered. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s nice to get something right for a change. You don\u0027t know how irritating it is - missing things the way I have been. I feel so useless. So . . . normal.\" She cringed in horror of the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine how awful that must feel. Being normal? Ugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Well, at least this makes up for missing your annoying thief - now I just have to figure out what I\u0027m not seeing in Seattle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she said the words that way - putting the two situations together in one sentence - right then it clicked. The elusive something that had been bothering me for days, the important connection that I couldn\u0027t quite put together, suddenly became clear. I stared at her, my face frozen with whatever expression was already in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to open it?\" she asked. She sighed when I didn\u0027t move immediately, and tugged the top of the box off herself. She pulled something out and held it up, but I couldn\u0027t concentrate on what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty, don\u0027t you think? I picked blue, because I know it\u0027s Edward\u0027s favorite on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the same,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\" she demanded. \"You don\u0027t have anything like this. For crying out loud, you only own one skirt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Alice! Forget the clothes, listen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like it?\" Alice\u0027s face clouded with disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Alice, don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s the same! The one who broke in and stole my things, and the new vampires in Seattle. They\u0027re together!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clothes slipped from her fingers and fell back into the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice focused now, her voice suddenly sharp. \"Why do you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember what Edward said? About someone using the holes in your vision to keep you from seeing the newborns? And then what you said before, about the timing being too perfect - how careful my thief was to make no contact, as if he knew you would see that. I think you were right, Alice, I think he did know. I think he was using those holes, too. And what are the odds that two different people not only know enough about you to do that, but also decided to do it at exactly the same time? No way. It\u0027s one person. The same one. The one who is making the army is the one who stole my scent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice wasn\u0027t accustomed to being taking by surprise. She froze, and was still for so long that I started counting in my head as I waited. She didn\u0027t move for two minutes straight. Then her eyes refocused on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" she said in a hollow tone. \"Of course you\u0027re right. And when you put it that way. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward had it wrong,\" I whispered. \"It was a test . . . to see if it would work. If he could get in and out safely as long as he didn\u0027t do anything you would be watching out for. Like trying to kill me. . . . And he didn\u0027t take my things to prove he\u0027d found me. He stole my scent . . . so that others could find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were wide with shock. I was right, and I could see that she knew it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" she mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was through expecting my emotions to make sense anymore. As I processed the fact that someone had created an army of vampires - the army that had gruesomely murdered dozens of people in Seattle - for the express purpose of destroying me, I felt a spasm of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of it was finally solving that irritating feeling that I was missing something vital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the larger part was something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I whispered, \"everyone can relax. Nobody\u0027s trying to exterminate the Cullens after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think that one thing has changed, you\u0027re absolutely wrong,\" Alice said through her teeth. \"If someone wants one of us, they\u0027re going to have to go through the rest of us to get to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Alice. But at least we know what they\u0027re really after. That has to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" she muttered. She started pacing back and forth across my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThud, thud - a fist hammered against my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped. Alice didn\u0027t seem to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you ready yet? We\u0027re gonna be late!\" Charlie complained, sounding edgy. Charlie hated occasions about as much as I did. In his case, a lot of the problem was having to dress up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost. Give me a minute,\" I said hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet for half a second. \"Are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m nervous. Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him clump down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" Alice whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward is coming. If he hears this . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, go!\" I urged immediately. Edward would go berserk when he knew. I couldn\u0027t keep it from him for long, but maybe the graduation ceremony wasn\u0027t the best time for his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it on,\" Alice commanded as she flitted out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what she said, dressing in a daze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been planning to do something more sophisticated with my hair, but time was up, so it hung straight and boring as on any other day. It didn\u0027t matter. I didn\u0027t bother to look in the mirror, so I had no idea how Alice\u0027s sweater and skirt ensemble worked. That didn\u0027t matter, either. I threw the ugly yellow polyester graduation robe over my arm and hurried down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look nice,\" Charlie said, already gruff with suppressed emotion. \"Is that new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I mumbled, trying to concentrate. \"Alice gave it to me. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward arrived just a few minutes after his sister left. It wasn\u0027t enough time for me to pull together a calm faade. But, since we were riding in the cruiser with Charlie, he never had a chance to ask me what was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie had gotten stubborn last week when he\u0027d learned that I was intending to ride with Edward to the graduation ceremony. And I could see his point - parents should have some rights come graduation day. I\u0027d conceded with good grace, and Edward had cheerfully suggested that we all go together. Since Carlisle and Esme had no problem with this, Charlie couldn\u0027t come up with a compelling objection; he\u0027d agreed with poor grace. And now Edward rode in the backseat of my father\u0027s police car, behind the fiberglass divider, with an amused expression - probably due to my father\u0027s amused expression, and the grin that widened every time Charlie stole a glance at Edward in his rearview mirror. Which almost certainly meant that Charlie was imagining things that would get him in trouble with me if he said them out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Edward whispered when he helped me from the front seat in the school parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nervous,\" I answered, and it wasn\u0027t even a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so beautiful,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he wanted to say more, but Charlie, in an obvious maneuver that he meant to be subtle, shrugged in between us and put his arm around my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you excited?\" he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, this is a big deal. You\u0027re graduating from high school. It\u0027s the real world for you now. College. Living on your own. . . . You\u0027re not my little girl anymore.\" Charlie choked up a bit at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" I moaned. \"Please don\u0027t get all weepy on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s weepy?\" he growled. \"Now, why aren\u0027t you excited?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Dad. I guess it hasn\u0027t hit yet or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good that Alice is throwing this party. You need something to perk you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. A party\u0027s exactly what I need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie laughed at my tone and squeezed my shoulders. Edward looked at the clouds, his face thoughtful. My father had to leave us at the back door of the gym and go around to the main entrance with the rest of the parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was pandemonium as Ms. Cope from the front office and Mr. Varner the math teacher tried to line everyone up alphabetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up front, Mr. Cullen,\" Mr. Varner barked at Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Bella!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up to see Jessica Stanley waving at me from the back of the line with a smile on her face. Edward kissed me quickly, sighed, and went to go stand with the C\u0027s. Alice wasn\u0027t there. What was she going to do? Skip graduation? What poor timing on my part. I should have waited to figure things out until after this was over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down here, Bella!\" Jessica called again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down the line to take my place behind Jessica, mildly curious as to why she was suddenly so friendly. As I got closer, I saw Angela five people back, watching Jessica with the same curiosity. Jess was babbling before I was in earshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . so amazing. I mean, it seems like we just met, and now we\u0027re graduating together,\" she gushed. \"Can you believe it\u0027s over? I feel like screaming!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all just so incredible. Do you remember your first day here? We were friends, like, right away. From the first time we saw each other. Amazing. And now I\u0027m off to California and you\u0027ll be in Alaska and I\u0027m going to miss you so much! You have to promise that we\u0027ll get together sometimes! I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re having a party. That\u0027s perfect. Because we really haven\u0027t spent much time together in a while and now we\u0027re all leaving. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe droned on and on, and I was sure the sudden return of our friendship was due to graduation nostalgia and gratitude for the party invite, not that I\u0027d had anything to do with that. I paid attention as well as I could while I shrugged into my robe. And I found that I was glad that things could end on a good note with Jessica. Because it was an ending, no matter what Eric, the valedictorian, had to say about commencement meaning \"beginning\" and all the rest of the trite nonsense. Maybe more for me than for the rest, but we were all leaving something behind us today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt went so quickly. I felt like I\u0027d hit the fast forward button. Were we supposed to march quite that fast? And then Eric was speed talking in his nervousness, the words and phrases running together so they didn\u0027t make sense anymore. Principal Greene started calling names, one after the other without a long enough pause between; the front row in the gymnasium was rushing to catch up. Poor Ms. Cope was all thumbs as she tried to give the principal the right diploma to hand to the right student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as Alice, suddenly appearing, danced across the stage to take hers, a look of deep concentration on her face. Edward followed behind, his expression confused, but not upset. Only the two of them could carry off the hideous yellow and still look the way they did. They stood out from the rest of the crowd, their beauty and grace otherworldly. I wondered how I\u0027d ever fallen for their human farce. A couple of angels, standing there with wings intact, would be less conspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Mr. Greene call my name and I rose from my chair, waiting for the line in front of me to move. I was conscious of cheering in the back of the gym, and I looked around to see Jacob pulling Charlie to his feet, both of them hooting in encouragement. I could just make out the top of Billy\u0027s head beside Jake\u0027s elbow. I managed to throw them an approximation of a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Greene finished with the list of names, and then continued to hand out diplomas with a sheepish grin as we filed past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations, Miss Stanley,\" he mumbled as Jess took hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations, Miss Swan,\" he mumbled to me, pressing the diploma into my good hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to stand next to Jessica with the assembled graduates. Jess was all red around the eyes, and she kept blotting her face with the sleeve of her robe. It took me a second to understand that she was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Greene said something I didn\u0027t hear, and everyone around me shouted and screamed. Yellow hats rained down. I pulled mine off, too late, and just let it fall to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Bella!\" Jess blubbered over the sudden roar of conversation. \"I can\u0027t believe we\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s all over,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her arms around my neck. \"You have to promise we won\u0027t lose touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged her back, feeling a little awkward as I dodged her request. \"I\u0027m so glad I know you, Jessica. It was a good two years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was,\" she sighed, and sniffed. Then she dropped her arms. \"Lauren!\" she squealed, waving over her head and pushing through the massed yellow gowns. Families were beginning to converge, pressing us tighter together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught sight of Angela and Ben, but they were surrounded by their families. I would congratulate them later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI craned my head, looking for Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations,\" Edward whispered in my ear, his arms winding around my waist. His voice was subdued; he\u0027d been in no hurry for me to reach this particular milestone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look like you\u0027re over the nerves yet,\" he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s left to worry about? The party? It won\u0027t be that horrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy searching wasn\u0027t quite as subtle as I\u0027d thought. \"Alice - where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ran out as soon as she had her diploma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice took on a new tone. I looked up to see his confused expression as he stared toward the back door of the gym, and I made an impulse decision - the kind I really should think twice about, but rarely did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worrying about Alice?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er . . .\" He didn\u0027t want to answer that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was she thinking about, anyway? To keep you out, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flashed down to my face, and narrowed in suspicion. \"She was translating the Battle Hymn of the Republic into Arabic, actually. When she finished that, she moved on to Korean sign language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed nervously. \"I suppose that would keep her head busy enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what she\u0027s hiding from me,\" he accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" I smiled a weak smile. \"I\u0027m the one who came up with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around. Charlie would be on his way through the crowd now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing Alice,\" I whispered in a rush, \"she\u0027ll probably try to keep this from you until after the party. But since I\u0027m all for the party being canceled - well, don\u0027t go berserk, regardless, okay? It\u0027s always better to know as much as possible. It has to help somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Charlie\u0027s head bob up over the other heads as he searched for me. He spotted me and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just stay calm, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded once, his mouth a grim line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn hurried whispers I explained my reasoning to him. \"I think you\u0027re wrong about things coming at us from all sides. I think it\u0027s mostly coming at us from one side . . . and I think it\u0027s coming at me, really. It\u0027s all connected, it has to be. It\u0027s just one person who\u0027s messing with Alice\u0027s visions. The stranger in my room was a test, to see if someone could get around her. It\u0027s got to be the same one who keeps changing his mind, and the newborns, and stealing my clothes - all of it goes together. My scent is for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face had turned so white that I had a hard time finishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no one\u0027s coming for you, don\u0027t you see? This is good - Esme and Alice and Carlisle, no one wants to hurt them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were huge, wide with panic, dazed and horrified. He could see that I was right, just as Alice had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on his cheek. \"Calm,\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella!\" Charlie crowed, pushing his way past the close-packed families around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations, baby!\" He was stillyelling, even though he was right at my ear now. He wrapped his arms around me, ever so slyly shuffling Edward off to the side as he did so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I muttered, preoccupied by the expression on Edward\u0027s face. He still hadn\u0027t gained control. His hands were halfway extended toward me, like he was about to grab me and make a run for it. Only slightly more in control of myself than he was, running didn\u0027t seem like such a terrible idea to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob and Billy had to take off - did you see that they were here?\" Charlie asked, taking a step back, but keeping his hands on my shoulders. He had his back to Edward - probably an effort to exclude him, but that was fine at the moment. Edward\u0027s mouth was hanging open, his eyes still wide with dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I assured my father, trying to pay enough attention. \"Heard them, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was nice of them to show up,\" Charlie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mm-hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so telling Edward had been a really bad idea. Alice was right to keep her thoughts clouded. I should have waited till we were alone somewhere, maybe with the rest of his family. And nothing breakable close by - like windows . . . cars . . . school buildings. His face brought back all my fear and then some. Though his expression was past the fear now - it was pure fury that was suddenly plain on his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where do you want to go out for dinner?\" Charlie asked. \"The sky\u0027s the limit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can cook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly. Do you want to go to the Lodge?\" he asked with an eager smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not particularly enjoy Charlie\u0027s favorite restaurant, but, at this point, what was the difference? I wasn\u0027t going to be able to eat anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, the Lodge, cool,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie smiled wider, and then sighed. He turned his head halfway toward Edward, without really looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You coming, too, Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, my eyes beseeching. Edward pulled his expression together just before Charlie turned to see why he hadn\u0027t gotten an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" Edward said stiffly, his face hard and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have plans with your parents?\" Charlie asked, a frown in his voice. Edward was always more polite than Charlie deserved; the sudden hostility surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. If you\u0027ll excuse me. . . .\" Edward turned abruptly and stalked away through the dwindling crowd. He moved just a little bit too fast, too upset to keep up his usually perfect charade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I say?\" Charlie asked with a guilty expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it, Dad,\" I reassured him. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you two fighting again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s fighting. Mind your own business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are my business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"Let\u0027s go eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lodge was crowded. The place was, in my opinion, overpriced and tacky, but it was the only thing close to a formal restaurant in town, so it was always popular for events. I stared morosely at a depressed- looking stuffed elk head while Charlie ate prime rib and talked over the back of the seat to Tyler Crowley\u0027s parents. It was noisy - everyone there had just come from graduation, and most were chatting across the aisles and over the booth-tops like Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my back to the front windows, and I resisted the urge to turn around and search for the eyes I could feel on me now. I knew I wouldn\u0027t be able to see anything. Just as I knew there was no chance that he would leave me unguarded, even for a second. Not after this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner dragged. Charlie, busy socializing, ate too slowly. I picked at my burger, stuffing pieces of it into my napkin when I was sure his attention was somewhere else. It all seemed to take a very long time, but when I looked at the clock - which I did more often than necessary - the hands hadn\u0027t moved much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Charlie got his change back and put a tip on the table. I stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a hurry?\" he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to help Alice set things up,\" I claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He turned away from me to say goodnight to everyone. I went out to wait by the cruiser. I leaned against the passenger door, waiting for Charlie to drag himself away from the impromptu party. It was almost dark in the parking lot, the clouds so thick that there was no telling if the sun had set or not. The air felt heavy, like it was about to rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething moved in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gasp turned into a sigh of relief as Edward appeared out of the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, he pulled me tightly against his chest. One cool hand found my chin, and pulled my face up so that he could press his hard lips to mine. I could feel the tension in his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you?\" I asked as soon as he let me breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so great,\" he murmured. \"But I\u0027ve got a handle on myself. I\u0027m sorry that I lost it back there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fault. I should have waited to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he disagreed. \"This is something I needed to know. I can\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t see it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a lot on your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly kissed me again, not letting me answer. He pulled away after just a second. \"Charlie\u0027s on his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have him drop me at your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll follow you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not really necessary,\" I tried to say, but he was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Charlie called from the doorway of the restaurant, squinting into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie sauntered out to the car, muttering about impatience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how do you feel?\" he asked me as we drove north along the highway. \"It\u0027s been a big day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel fine,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, seeing through me easily. \"Worried about the party?\" he guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I lied again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he didn\u0027t notice. \"You were never one for the parties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder where I got that from,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie chuckled. \"Well, you look really nice. I wish I\u0027d thought to get you something. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not silly. I feel like I don\u0027t always do everything for you that I should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous. You do a fantastic job. World\u0027s best dad. And . . .\" It wasn\u0027t easy to talk about feelings with Charlie, but I persevered after clearing my throat. \"And I\u0027m really glad I came to live with you, Dad. It was the best idea I ever had. So don\u0027t worry - you\u0027re just experiencing post-graduation pessimism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Maybe. But I\u0027m sure I slipped up in a few places. I mean, look at your hand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down blankly at my hands. My left hand rested lightly on the dark brace I rarely thought about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy broken knuckle didn\u0027t hurt much anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never thought I needed to teach you how to throw a punch. Guess I was wrong about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were on Jacob\u0027s side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what side I\u0027m on, if someone kisses you without your permission, you should be able to make your feelings clear without hurting yourself. You didn\u0027t keep your thumb inside your fist, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dad. That\u0027s kind of sweet in a weird way, but I don\u0027t think lessons would have helped. Jacob\u0027s head is really hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie laughed. \"Hit him in the gut next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time?\" I asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, don\u0027t be too hard on the kid. He\u0027s young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s obnoxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" I sighed. \"I don\u0027t really know what the right thing to do here is, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie nodded slowly. \"Yeah. The right thing isn\u0027t always real obvious. Sometimes the right thing for one person is the wrong thing for someone else. So . . . good luck figuring that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I muttered dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie laughed again, and then frowned. \"If this party gets too wild . . . ,\" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it, Dad. Carlisle and Esme are going to be there. I\u0027m sure you can come, too, if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie grimaced as he squinted through the windshield into the night. Charlie enjoyed a good party just about as much as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the turnoff, again?\" he asked. \"They ought to clear out their drive - it\u0027s impossible to find in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just around the next bend, I think.\" I pursed my lips. \"You know, you\u0027re right - it is impossible to find. Alice said she put a map in the invitation, but even so, maybe everyone will get lost.\" I cheered up slightly at the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Charlie said as the road curved to the east. \"Or maybe not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black velvet darkness was interrupted ahead, just where the Cullens\u0027 drive should be. Someone had wrapped the trees on either side in thousands of twinkle lights, impossible to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice,\" I said sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" Charlie said as we turned onto the drive. The two trees at the entry weren\u0027t the only ones lit. Every twenty feet or so, another shining beacon guided us toward the big white house. All the way - all three miles of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t do things halfway, does she?\" Charlie mumbled in awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you don\u0027t want to come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extremely sure. Have fun, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks so much, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was laughing to himself as I got out and shut the door. I watched him drive away, still grinning. With a sigh, I marched up the stairs to endure my party. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-17.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
