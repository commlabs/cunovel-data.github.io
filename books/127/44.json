Fromthe\u0026nbsp; standpoint of precedence\u0026nbsp; alone, he\u0026nbsp; deserved his appointment\u0026nbsp; as headpriest- attendant upon the flagship Wienis.\n\u003cbr\u003e But it\u0026nbsp; was not\u0026nbsp; only rank or precedence.\u0026nbsp; He knew the ship.\u0026nbsp; He had workeddirectly under\u0026nbsp; the holy\u0026nbsp; men from the\u0026nbsp; Foundation itself in\u0026nbsp; repairing theship. He\u0026nbsp; had gone over the\u0026nbsp; motors under their orders.\u0026nbsp; He had rewired the\u0027visors; revamped\u0026nbsp; the communications system; replated\u0026nbsp; the punctured hull;reinforced the beams. He had even been permitted to help while the wise menof the\u0026nbsp; Foundation had installed a device so holy\u0026nbsp; it had never been placedin\u0026nbsp; any previous\u0026nbsp; ship,\u0026nbsp; but had\u0026nbsp; been reserved\u0026nbsp; only for\u0026nbsp; this magnificentcolossus of a vessel ?a hyperwave relay.\n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0026nbsp; was no wonder\u0026nbsp; that he felt\u0026nbsp; heartsick over\u0026nbsp; the purposes to\u0026nbsp; which theglorious ship\u0026nbsp; was perverted. He\u0026nbsp; had never wanted to\u0026nbsp; believe what Verisofhad told him ? that the ship was to be used for appalling wickedness; thatits\u0026nbsp; guns\u0026nbsp; were to\u0026nbsp; be\u0026nbsp; turned\u0026nbsp; on the\u0026nbsp; great\u0026nbsp; Foundation.\u0026nbsp; Turned on\u0026nbsp; thatFoundation,\u0026nbsp; where\u0026nbsp; he\u0026nbsp; had\u0026nbsp; been\u0026nbsp; trained\u0026nbsp; as\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; youth,\u0026nbsp; from\u0026nbsp; which\u0026nbsp; allblessedness was derived.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet\u0026nbsp; he\u0026nbsp; could\u0026nbsp; not\u0026nbsp; doubt\u0026nbsp; now,\u0026nbsp; after\u0026nbsp; what\u0026nbsp; the admiral\u0026nbsp; had\u0026nbsp; told\u0026nbsp; him.\n\u003cbr\u003e How could the king,\u0026nbsp; divinely blessed, allow this abominable act? Or was itthe king?\u0026nbsp; Was it not, perhaps,\u0026nbsp; an action of the\u0026nbsp; accursed regent, Wienis,without the knowledge\u0026nbsp; of the king at all. And it was\u0026nbsp; the son of this sameWienis\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; was\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; admiral\u0026nbsp; who\u0026nbsp; five\u0026nbsp; minutes before\u0026nbsp; had\u0026nbsp; told\u0026nbsp; him:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Attend\u0026nbsp; to your\u0026nbsp; souls and\u0026nbsp; your blessings,\u0026nbsp; priest.

His. acolyte precededhim\u0026nbsp; and the two\u0026nbsp; officers in charge\u0026nbsp; made no\u0026nbsp; move to interfere.\u0026nbsp; The headpriest-attendant\u0026nbsp; had\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; right\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; free\u0026nbsp; entry anywhere\u0026nbsp; on\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Close the door,\" Aporat\u0026nbsp; ordered, and looked at the chronometer. It lackedFive minutes of twelve. He had timed it well.\n\u003cbr\u003e With quick\u0026nbsp; practiced motions, he\u0026nbsp; moved the little levers\u0026nbsp; that opened allcommunications,\u0026nbsp; so that every\u0026nbsp; part of\u0026nbsp; the two-mile-long ship\u0026nbsp; was withinreach of his voice and his image.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Soldiers of the royal flagship Wienis, attend! It is your priest-attendantthat speaks!\"\u0026nbsp; The sound of his voice reverberated,\u0026nbsp; he knew, from the stematom\u0026nbsp; blast in\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; extreme rear\u0026nbsp; to the\u0026nbsp; navigation\u0026nbsp; tables in\u0026nbsp; the prow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your ship,\" he cried, \"is engaged in sacrilege.

He exulted and fromthe pocket of his long robe withdrew a self-powered nucleo-bulb that filledthe room with pearly light.\n\u003cbr\u003e He looked\u0026nbsp; down at the two soldiers who,\u0026nbsp; brave men though they undoubtedlywere, writhed on their\u0026nbsp; knees in the last extremity of mortal terror. \"Saveour souls,\u0026nbsp; your reverence.
