When I called Saturday, and all the times we talked before that, you thought Collin had gone to Mexico. We all did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another creak from the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is that noise?” Nina said. She stood and moved toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did this information come from, Mrs. Baird?” Hasselback asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nina, wait,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina cocked her head in an effort to see around the corner at the top of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood, letting the photograph of the man who had assaulted Anne Rehmann, the man who had raped and murdered Mrs. Rogers, slip from my fingers. It bounced against a book on the coffee table and rattled to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when I saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for the Beretta. My hand closed around the butt and I yanked it from the holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollin Baird gripped the banister with his left hand and leapt over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina gasped and brought her hand to her mouth the way someone might when startled during a horror movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaird had an automatic in his right hand. As he jumped, he swung the gun in a high arc. It crashed against Nina’s temple just as his feet hit the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force of the blow spun her body. Nina caromed off the wall and slid to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaird pressed his free hand against his ribs and grimaced as if the jump had hurt him, and I wondered if that was where he had been hit during our shootout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his gun at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought the Beretta up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not again,” Mrs. Baird said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Police,” Hasselback shouted. “Don’t move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollin Baird threw a wild shot in our direction and ran for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved Mrs. Baird away and took off after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused for a beat when I reached Nina’s side. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was twisted in an ugly grin. She had brought her hand up and was covering the wound on her head. Blood seeped between her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nuts,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the screen door with my shoulder. It flew open and I dove across the lawn, landed on my shoulder, and rolled into a crouch. I brought the Beretta up with both hands and swept the muzzle over the front yard and street and surrounding houses. Collin Baird was not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I heard running behind me and turned toward the noise. I moved quickly to Mrs. Baird’s house and began to move cautiously around it. The two sides of my brain were shouting at each other. “He’s getting away,” said one. “Go slow,” said the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back yard opened up onto a wooded area. I took cover at the corner of the house. I waited. I listened. I saw and heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dashed across the yard into the woods and paused again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraining and experience had quieted the shouting. I told myself, this was his ground. He grew up here. Following him into the woods would be a fatal mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRule Number One, my inner voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly backed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonuvabitch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to the sound of sirens approaching, sirens that almost always came too late. I didn’t want to be the one standing there with a gun in my hand when the cops arrived, so I holstered the Beretta and made my way back into the house. I found Nina sitting in a chair near the door. She was pressing a folded handkerchief to her temple. A trickle of blood ran down her hand and wrist and spotted her blue shirt and black skirt. Her eyes were wet with tears, yet she made no sound. I knelt before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me see,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head and gestured toward the sitting area. Chief Hasselback was kneeling next to Mrs. Baird. She had doubled up her hands and was applying pressure to an area just above the woman’s breasts—standard procedure for treating a sucking chest wound. Her hands and wrists and shirt were soaked with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay with me, Mrs. Baird,” the chief said. “It’ll be all right. Help is on the way. Help will be here soon. Stay with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to the chief’s side and looked over her shoulder. Mrs. Baird’s eyes were closed, and if she was breathing, I didn’t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay with me,” the chief said. “Just for a few more minutes. Help is coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opened and paramedics filled the room. They relieved the chief. She stood and watched them work. Blood dripped off of her hands onto the floor. She didn’t seem to notice the blood until the paramedics confirmed what we already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIXTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like a kite baffled by the changing winds. At any moment I could come crashing down. I tried not to let Nina know it, though. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-may-care-mac-mckenzie-11/page-70.html","bookId":2216,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM"}
