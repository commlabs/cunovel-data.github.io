But I was hoping it wasn\u0027t true. You nold m\" wknow how he is. Fixated on Raven. I think he likes that new girl just so he can feel like he\u0027s dating her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuh-uh!\" the first one said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you\u0027ll go as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.

I knew on the one hand they were trying to make fun of me. And then on the other hand, if they wanted to see how the other half lived, they might actually like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to go goth this year. Any hints?\" Heather continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to divulge my secrets to them. They wore what they did to be \"in.\" I wore what I did because it was me. It was my soul. It was my being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year I went as a tennis player. And a tennis player should be able to dress as a goth. It was, after all, Halloween.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t feel like making it too easy on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go to the thrift store,\" I told them. \"I think they should have something black that you can rip up and make look really funky.\" I was pleased with myself that I gave them some helpful tips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh,\" Heather said. \"Wear something someone else has worn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in this lifetime,\" Courtney added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Trevor turned the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Trev!\" Heather said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor was passing out orange flyers with black writing. He handed them each one, and they read them to themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This looks like fun,\" Courtney flirted. \"We\u0027ll see you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027ll see me, all right, but you may not recognize me.\" The two girls giggled and then headed back to their lockers. Then he looked at me. \"You don\u0027t need a flyer,\" he said. \"You already know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d still like to have one,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze was cute but menacing. \"For your scrapbook of horrors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, right next to my picture of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snagged a flyer from his hand before he took off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHAUNTED HAPPENINGS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLEAVE YOUR FEARS AT THE DOOR sOR\u0026lt;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBE THE FIRST TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDATE: THIS SATURDAY NIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOCATION: THE CRYPT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be clinging to Matt for dear life!\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll cling to Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll cling to Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you aren\u0027t afraid of anything,\" Becky teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I still can cling to him, can\u0027t I?\" I said with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can he see in the dark?\" she whispered. \"Or does he have night vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How cool! I knew he had superhuman powers.\" \"He\u0027ll be my hero for the evening. He can save us all from the creepy monsters!\" Becky looked at me as if to say, \"Why should I be scared of a guy dressed up as a ghost when I\u0027m standing by a real vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me,\" I said. \"It\u0027s Jagger\u0027s haunted house. It will be scary - even for a vampire!\" Becky and I screamed out loud, then giggled until we couldn\u0027t breathe while the Prada-bees shot us looks like we were insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after sunset, Becky and I picked up Stormy and we headed over to our seasonal Halloween store, which had a great selection of costumes. Scarlet and Onyx were waiting for us inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Luna coming?\" I asked. I knew Stormy wanted her to be a part of the group. But Luna had made it clear at the Crypt that she insisted that it be the two of them only, and that left Stormy with a difficult choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Scarlet said. \"I told her to come, but she seemed to be put off that we were all coming. Her loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I said. \"I guess you\u0027ll have to settle for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\" Stormy smiled. \"It\u0027s a shame she feels that way. It\u0027s really too bad. You are my friend as much as she is.\" I am? I wanted to say. It was so sweet of her to say and so cool to hear. I had made it into Stormy\u0027s inner circle. \"Thanks,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy seemed so mature. She headed off to one o s ofseasf the costume aisles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, are you meeting up with Trevor?\" I asked Scarlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he wants to work the haunted house,\" she said, disappointed. \"I\u0027ll have to see him afterward. But I told him he\u0027ll have to make up for lost time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really like him, don\u0027t you?\" I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was happy for Scarlet that she found someone she liked. However, I wasn\u0027t so happy that it was Trevor. I still wasn\u0027t sure how much he cared for her, and I didn\u0027t want my friend to get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think of this?\" Scarlet asked, holding up a cute devil outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks cool!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it, too, but I\u0027m thinking of going for something different. Out of my comfort zone.\" She buzzed off into another aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who is your official date for Halloween?\" I asked Onyx as she eyed the costumes. \"Sebastian or Jagger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of going solo,\" she said. \"Jagger will be busy that night with his operations. And there will be tons of girls there. Sebastian will have his hands full\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- he is a flirt, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since he\u0027s set his sights on you. Other than dancing with Stormy, he seems fixated on you,\" I said with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky modeled a pink-and-purple butterfly costume. \"I think it\u0027s adorable,\" she squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should wear this,\" I said to Onyx as I held up a Cleopatra wig and costume. \"It seems fitting. Marc Antony or Julius Caesar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"I love it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t find a thing,\" Stormy said as she tore through the costumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I found what I want to wear!\" I pulled it over to find Scarlet holding the same outfit. It was a preppy school uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to embrace the lighter side,\" she said. \"And I thought Trevor would love it,\" she said. \"I guess you had the same idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the Trevor part,\" I said. \"But I usually go preppy on Halloween.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" she asked, surprised. \"I bet no one in town recognized you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fun to dress up differently for the night,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you wear it?\" she suggested. \"I\u0027m sure Alexander is dying to see you all prepped up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, spotting another costume. She held up a red-and-white soccer uniform. \"This one is perfect for me. I\u0027ll have Trevor really drooling.\" I examined my preppy uniform. Though it wasn\u0027t me, it really was quite pretty. I couldn\u0027t wait to get all decked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t find anything!\" Stormy\u0027s temper began to flare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"There are tons of costumes here. We\u0027re bound to find you one.\" She tore back into the aisles. \"I found it,\" she said, holding up a Princess Leia outfit. \"I know Billy and Henry will love it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"It will be their dream come true!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-11.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
