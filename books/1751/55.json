At least, he showed interest and didn\u0027t sulk. And he threw no tantrums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernadsky was even telling Sheffield that last evening Mark had spoken to him quite normally, without raised voices on either side, about planetary crust analyses. Vernadsky had laughed a bit about it, saying that Mark knew the crust analyses of twenty thousand planets and someday he\u0027d have the boy repeat them all just to see how long it would take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark, himself, had made no mention of the matter. In fact, he had spent the morning sitting in his tent. Sheffield had looked in, seen him on his cot, staring at his feet, and had left him to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he really needed at the moment, Sheffield felt, was a bright idea for himself. A really bright one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, everything had come to nothing. A whole month of nothing. Rodriguez held fast against any infection. Vernadsky absolutely barred food poisoning; Novee shook his head with vehement negativeness at suggestions of disturbed metabolism. \"Where\u0027s the evidence?\" he kept saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it amounted to was that every physical cause of death was eliminated on the strength of expert opinion. But men, women, and children had died. There must be a reason. Could it be psychological?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had satirized the matter to Cimon for a purpose before they had come out here, but it was now time and more than time to be serious about it. Could the settlers have been driven to suicide? Why? Humanity had colonized tens of thousands of planets without its haying seriously affected mental stability. In fact, the suicide rate, as well as the incidence of psychoses, was higher on Earth than anywhere else in the Galaxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, the settlement had called frantically for medical help. They didn\u0027t want to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonality disorders? Something peculiar to that one group? Enough to affect over a.thousand people to the death? Unlikely. Besides, how could any evidence be uncovered? The settlement site had been ransacked for any films or records, even the most frivolous. Nothing. A century of dampness left nothing so fragile as purposeful records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he was working in a vacuum. He felt helpless. The others at least, had data; something to chew on. He had nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself at Mark\u0027s tent again and looked inside automatically. It was empty. He looked about and spied Mark walking out of the camp and into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield cried out after him, \"Mark! Wait for me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark stopped, made as though to go on, thought better of it, and let Sheffield\u0027s long legs consume the distance between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield said, \"Where are you off to?\" (Even after running it was necessary to pant in Junior\u0027s rich atmosphere.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s eyes were sullen. \"To the air-coaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t had a chance to look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, of course you\u0027ve had a chance,\" said Sheffield. \"You were watching Fawkes like a hawk on the trip over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark scowled. \"Everyone was around. I want to see if for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield felt disturbed. The kid was angry. He\u0027d better tag along and try to find out what was wrong. He said, \"Come to think of it, I\u0027d like to see the coaster myself. You don\u0027t mind having me along, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark hesitated. Then he said, \"We-ell. If you want to.\" It wasn\u0027t exactly a gracious invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield said, \"What are you carrying, Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tree branch. I cut if off with the buss-field gun. I\u0027m taking it with me just in case anyone wants to stop me.\" He swung it so that it whistled through the thick air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should anyone want to stop you, Mark? I\u0027d throw it away. It\u0027s hard and heavy. You could hurt someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark was striding on. \"I\u0027m not throwing it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield pondered briefly, then decided against a quarrel at the moment. It would be better to get to the basic reason for this hostility first. \"All right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air-coaster lay in a clearing, its clear metal surface throwing back green high lights (Lagrange II had not yet risen.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark looked carefully about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no one in sight, Mark,\" said Sheffield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed aboard. It was a large coaster. It had carried seven men and the necessary supplies in only three trips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield looked at its control panel with something quite close to awe. He said, \"Imagine a botanist like Fawkes learning to run one of these things. It\u0027s so far outside his specialty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can run one,\" said Mark suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield stared at him in surprise. \"You can?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watched Dr. Fawkes when we came. I know everything he did. And he has a repair manual for the coaster. I sneaked that out once and read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield said lightly, \"Well, That\u0027s very nice. We have a spare navigator for an emergency, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from Mark then, so he never saw the tree limb as it came down on his head. He didn\u0027t hear Mark\u0027s troubled voice saying, \"I\u0027m sorry, Dr. Sheffield.\" He didn\u0027t even, properly speaking, feel the concussion that knocked him out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-55.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
