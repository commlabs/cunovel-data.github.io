The heavy trailer didn’t help its handling at al .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt three hundred meters, with a bit of help from his visor’s optics, Vaz could see ‘Telcam’s face. Bastard. Wel , at least he didn’t have to smile at the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsman brought the Warthog to a bumpy halt thirty meters from the welcoming committee and glanced over her shoulder at Vaz. “Give him a bit more latitude than you usual y would before blowing his head off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz hadn’t quite worked out the line between Osman’s humor and her sarcasm yet. It mattered. “How much more, ma’am? Seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever happens, let him get away with the weapons.” She was definitely serious now. “That’s what matters. Stoke the fire. You hear that, Staff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal sounded a little reluctant on the radio, but the captain had spoken. “Understood, ma’am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil ips didn’t say a word. Maybe he was used to taking risks with Elites now, but the meaning was stil clear: even if the hinge-head gutted Phil ips—and her—then Vaz and Mal had to hold fire, or at least not slot al the Elites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a lot to ask of him, and even more to ask of a civvie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillips volunteered. Look at him. He loves it. But even so … Osman climbed out of the Warthog and started walking slowly toward ‘Telcam, but the Elites appeared to be on an intercept heading anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. Vaz tilted the gun slowly, making his target clear, just to give the hinge-heads something to think about. When he checked Mal’s icon he found he was looking at the feed from the 99-D’s optics. Mal had the crosshairs steady on ‘Telcam’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wouldn’t dare.” Mal’s voice was just a breath in Vaz’s earpiece. “He’s not in a rush to meet his gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Telcam stalked over to the Warthog with his bagman in tow and wandered around the back to the trailer. He didn’t seem to take the slightest notice of Vaz, but at least Osman had the grace not to offer a handshake. Vaz pivoted the gun slowly so that it was facing the trailer. He couldn’t turn his back on ‘Telcam. The last time he’d been this close to anything in Covenant uniform, it had almost severed his jaw and only a quick-thinking combat medic had stopped him from choking on his own blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose you’l want to check out the consignment,” Osman said. “Rifles, assorted grenades, and antipersonnel mines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Telcam tilted his head back and forth as he surveyed the crates. Then he gestured and his sidekick ripped the lid off one of the crates like paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached in and pul ed out a plasma rifle. Vaz held his breath as ‘Telcam spent far too long examining it. Could he spot the tag? Vaz had grown up believing that the Covenant was technological y invincible. They weren’t, or at least ‘Telcam wasn’t. He either didn’t know or didn’t care, just like Naomi had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re most generous, Captain.” It was hard to tel if ‘Telcam was sneering or not. “And most frugal of you to retrieve Sangheili weapons. I have adherents in many keeps, and more join us every day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re asking if there’s more to come, there is,” Osman said. “If there’s anything specific, I’l see what else I can do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Telcam looked down his snout at her. “You cannot procure warships for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I realize that lending you a carrier would be embarrassing for both of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shal distribute the arms, then, and see how much progress we make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l be around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet we see no ship, Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nor wil you. This is stil hostile space in too many ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil ips seemed to be listening intently, but then Vaz realized from the man’s shifting focus that he was actual y concentrating on his audio channel. He was getting the intercepted voice traffic from the Elites. Had he heard something that worried him? Vaz glanced at Mal’s icon to check he stil had a shot on ‘Telcam. He did. Vaz leaned back casual y and made sure the Warthog’s gun was at just the right angle to take out the Elite’s bagman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsman suddenly got a dawning realization look on her face. “Do you real y need a ship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably not,” ‘Telcam said. “The initial target is the Arbiter, seeing as he’s foolish enough to be visiting each state to put his case for peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I kil him, then any fighting wil be keep by keep. Not the kind of battles fought by capital ships. Unless an entire colony world decides to stand by him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsman just gave him a nod. But Vaz could see the cogs grinding behind her eyes. There was no such thing as a careless word from her, and ‘Telcam didn’t seem the kind to announce his plans just to be sociable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very wel , have your people transfer these crates, then.” Osman obviously didn’t want him anywhere near Port Stanley, and they needed the trailer back. High-tech wars often foundered on smal , dul detail. “I’l have more for you in a week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was drip-feeding him. Vaz thought of Naomi going al zen about knowing how much fuel to pour on a fire. A couple of Brutes emerged from the Elite dropship and began moving the crates, lumbering back and forth until the trailer was cleared. It felt like a shady drugs deal in a back al ey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Telcam gave Osman a polite bow of the head and loped back to his ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsman waited for it to take off before she moved a muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he’s waiting to see if I’m going to warn the Arbiter,” she said. “Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct.” Phil ips climbed back into the Warthog and nearly brained himself on the gun. “The chatter from the fighters was al about what your actual game plan was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah wel , he’l get his proof, so no harm done,” she said. “And I’l find out where the arms actual y end up. Win-win. Okay, let’s bang out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want me to drive, ma’am?” Vaz asked. “I’m used to Hogs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsman almost smiled. She climbed into the gun seat. “Okay. If it makes you feel safer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz started the engine. He wasn’t taking any notice of Mal’s HUD feed now, so he expected to be back in the dropship and off this rock in a few minutes. But then rapid movement in the icon caught his peripheral vision and he stopped to check it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus Christ, ” Mal said. “Where the hel did he come from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mal?” Vaz could see the jerking, rol ing viewpoint of someone running down a steep slope, and then the horizon bounced everywhere for a few moments before the cam corrected for movement. Mal was running. “What is it, Mal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Contact. Human. Wait one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Osman asked. The pivot on the gun made a grinding noise. She was getting ready to fire. “What’s he spotted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz slammed his foot down and the Warthog shot off. “He’s seen a human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t be. The Covenant glassed this place years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil ips hung on to the dashboard with both hands as Vaz raced for the escarpment. When the Warthog came around the edge of the slope and Vaz got a clear view of the plain beyond, he saw Mal jogging toward a heap of rags among the boulders and scrubby vegetation that had somehow found the wil to grow again in the fissures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the rags stood up and became a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, great,” Osman said wearily. “That’s al we need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz wasn’t sure how to take that. He let Mal reach the guy first, just in case the sight of a Warthog bearing down on him made him panic, and came to a halt a few meters away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was ragged and emaciated—about fifty, straggly gray hair and beard, clutching a wood ax—but he looked pretty alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw the ships.” He had a strong accent, and he sounded stunned. “I saw the dropship. I didn’t think the Navy gave a damn about us. What’s the Covenant doing back here? What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The fighting’s stopped.” Mal tried to check him over. “Are you alone, mate? Have you been here al the time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since they glassed the place. I’m the only one left. But what’s going on? What’s the Covenant doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz looked at Osman. This wasn’t convenient at al . It was written al over her face. They real y didn’t need a passenger, least of al one who’d seen things he couldn’t explain. Vaz had the feeling that a lone witness didn’t have much of a life expectancy under the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal took off his helmet and caught Vaz’s eye. They’d served together so long that there was a kind of telepathy at moments like this. Something had to be said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz steered Osman away discreetly and they stood with their backs to Mal. “We can’t leave him here, ma’am,” Vaz whispered. Dead or alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s take him back and drop him off at the next bus stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as if she was in two minds about it. Vaz reminded himself that she was stil ONI, and he hardly knew her, even if his instinct told him she was okay. Parangosky would have just shot the guy and moved on, he decided. It would have saved a lot of trouble. But Osman seemed to be weighing something up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Phil ips had that rabbit-in-the-headlights look again. He’d never make a poker player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right,” Osman said at last, lips hardly moving. “But we’l have to lock him up. I don’t want a civvie loose on board, least of al on this mission. Quarantine him. Whatever excuse to stop him blabbing when we hand him on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and nodded at Mal, al reluctance. He nodded back, one thumb raised, and led the guy to the Warthog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’l take you to the nearest UNSC base, mate,” Mal said. “No luggage, I assume. What’s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Muir,” he said. “Tom Muir. Are you evacuating me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz gave him a hand up. “That’s the idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you’re seven damn years too late,” Muir said. “Where were you bastards when we real y needed you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome,” said Vaz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBEKAN KEEP, MDAMA, SANGHELIOS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaia was supervising the construction of a drying barn when Jul decided to break the news. It wasn’t a task he’d ever undertaken, and he marveled at the fact that she could turn her hand to overseeing such a project. Mdama was a rural backwater in a world of urban city-states. Now Jul and his neighbors had suddenly realized that farmland was the new power in a society of city-dwel ers used to importing much of its food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife in the Covenant under San’Shyuum oppression, as he understood it now, real y had made the Sangheili too dependent on others for basic elements of survival, just as Raia had said, too reliant on what was provided for them, done for them, and given to them in exchange for their military skil . Al they had now was a fortress world and nobody to run it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Raia was finding out how to manage food production by consulting ancient records, and he was working out how Sanghelios might govern itself as a global entity rather than a loose arrangement of keeps tasked by the Prophets. Their destiny was back in their own hands. They would learn to be great again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCivilizations rise and fall. The Jiralhanae, the Kig-Yar—and us. Except we can rise again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” Raia asked, not looking up from a thousand-year-old architectural plan she’d dug up from the keep’s vaults. The breeze buffeted the sheet of ancient vel um, snapping it like a sail. “Are you going to be away long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJul couldn’t remember ever lying to his wife, although he’d avoided tel ing her smal things that he knew would make her angry. “Ontom. Just a few days. Do you want to know why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boredom. I realize it’s hard to fil your time now the fighting’s stopped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Governance. We’re going to talk about how Sanghelios should be run. Forze’s coming with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaia rocked her head from side to side in grudging approval, then looked around at him. “Are you plotting, Jul?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew him too wel . There was no shame in chal enging decisions made by higher authorities, but there was a consequence for failing to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jul didn’t succeed in overthrowing the Arbiter, the Arbiter would then come after him, almost certainly kil him, and seize his keep and assets. Raia and the rest of his family would pay the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am,” he said, “but I won’t start what I know I can’t finish. Hence the need to gather like-minded keeps about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We might have different priorities, Jul, but I do agree with you. There’s no lasting peace to be made with humans. We’ve kil ed too many of them. This is just a lul in the war. It might be weeks or years or even centuries, but it’l never be truly over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to the plans. She’d had her say. The barn was starting to take recognizable shape, no doubt a simple thing to their ancestors, but something rather extraordinary to Jul. He walked back to the keep and stood by the transport to wait for Forze. It was a very old wave-skimmer, last used to ferry Unggoy laborers to the islands, but it would cope with an ocean trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope … He wasn’t a good swimmer. Few Sangheili were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’d pilot the skimmer himself to keep Gusay clear of any conspiracy. The young officer would stand a better chance of escaping retribution if Jul failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s your plan?” Forze asked as the skimmer headed out over the coast toward Ontom. “How are you going to find the right monks? And do you always steer like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJul had been a shipmaster for too long. Others piloted for him. But Sangheili have always had to sail and fly. Our geography demands it. He wasn’t sure if his faded skil was a tidy paral el with his homeworld’s situation or simply random irony, but either way it was an excel ent reminder of what he needed to do. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-glasslands-halo-8/page-16.html","bookId":1639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:30 PM"}
