{"id":28679,"no":43,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. LYING IN WAIT","content":"Night had fallen: not a bright or pleasant night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few skulkers had gathered behind the dwarf hedge, that skirted the piece of waste land near the North Works. An ill-looking set of men, as seen at present: for they had knelt so as to bring themselves almost on a level with the top of the hedge. Poole was in the middle; his face savage, a pistol in his right hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of all the men who had returned to work, the most obnoxious to the old hands was one named Ralley. It was not so much because he had been a turn-coat--that is, after holding out to the eleventh moment, had finally gone back at the twelfth--that the men hated him, as because they believed him to be treacherous. Ralley had been red-hot for the strike; had done more by his agitation than any one man to bring it about. He had resolutely refused all the overtures made by Richard North: and yet--he had gone back when the works were finally reopened. For this the men heartily despised him--far more than they did those who had been ready to go back from the first. In addition to this, they had been suspecting--and lately had felt sure--that he was a snake in the grass. That he had laid himself out to pick up, fairly or stealthily, as might be, bits of information about them, their doings and sayings, their wretched condition and threats of revenge, and had carried them to the works and to Richard North. And so--the contents of the pistol that Poole held in his hand were meant for Ralley.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a long time the malcontents of North Inlet had been burning to take vengeance on some one: some new treachery on Ralley\u0027s part, or suspected treachery, had come to light, and they determined to shoot him. Poor, misguided, foolish men! As if it would improve things for them! Suppose they killed Ralley, how would it better their condition? Ralley had not suffered half what they suffered. He was unmarried; and, during the strike, he had been helped by his relatives, who were pretty well off, so that he had known neither starvation nor tattered clothing, as they had: and this made his returning to work all the worse in their eyes. Ralley was about the age of Richard North, and not unlike him in height and figure: so much like him, indeed, that since their evil act had been determined on, one of the others had bade Poole take care he did not mistake the master for him in the dark. Poole\u0027s sullen rejoinder was, that it would not much matter if he did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The night was dark; a drizzling rain had come on, and the part where they were was not too well lighted. The small band, about to issue from the gates of the works, would pass this waste land within some fifteen yards of them. Poole had been a famous marksman in his day, and felt sure of his aim. John Allen knelt on his right, one Denton on his left, and one on either side beyond: five in all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five o\u0027clock struck. Almost simultaneously the bell at the works was heard, giving warning that it was time for the men to go to tea. Three or four sharp, quick strokes: nothing more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s Green, I\u0027ll swear,\" cried Denton, alluding to the ringer. \"I didn\u0027t know he was back again: his rheumatics must be better.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hush--sh--sh!\" was all Denton received in answer. And a death-like silence ensued. Poole broke it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where the devil are they? Why don\u0027t they come?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ay, why did they not come? Simply because there had been scarcely sufficient time for them to do so. But every moment, to these would-be murderers, kneeling there, seemed like a long-drawn-out period.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here they are,\" whispered Denton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was so. The men were coming out at the gate, about twenty of them; two and two; the policemen to-night heading the string. Sometimes the officers were behind, at other times at the side of the men. Poole rose cautiously and prepared to take aim. They were crossing from the gates, and presently would pass the hedge. This was the second night the men had thus lain in ambush. The previous night they had waited in like manner; but Ralley happened to be then on the other side his companion in the march, and so for the time was saved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allen stretched up his head. His sight was keen as a sailor\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which side\u0027s he on, Jack?\" whispered Poole. \"I don\u0027t see him yet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For answer John Allen put his hand quickly on Poole\u0027s arm to lower the pistol. \"No good again, mates,\" said he. \"Ralley ain\u0027t there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not there!\" retorted Poole with a strong oath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m as nigh sure of it as I can be,\" said Allen. \"Wait till they come nearer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It proved to be so. Ralley for some reason or other was not with the men. Denton again gave vent to a furious oath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tramp, tramp, tramp; their regular tread sounded in the stillness of the night as they passed. Poole had crouched down again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The steps died away in the distance, and the conspirators ventured to raise their heads. Allen happened to look in the direction of the gates.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here he is!\" burst forth Allen, with almost a suppressed scream. \"Something must have kept him back. Now\u0027s our time, mates. Here\u0027s Ralley.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That ain\u0027t his hat, Jack Allen,\" dissented one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hat be smothered! it\u0027s himself,\" said John Allen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ralley was coming on quickly, a dark, low-crowned hat somewhat drawn over his brows. A minute\u0027s silence, during which you might have heard their hearts beat, and then----\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Poole fired. Ralley gave a cry: staggered, and walked on. He was struck, no doubt, but not killed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your boasted aim has failed, Poole,\" cried Denton with a savage oath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not more savage than Poole\u0027s, though, as he broke through the low hedge. What the bullet had not done, the pistol itself should. Suddenly, with a startled cry, Allen broke after him, shouting to him to stay his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s the master, Poole; it\u0027s not Ralley. Stop, you fool!--it\u0027s the master.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Too late. It was, indeed, Richard North. And Mr. Poole had felled him by a wicked blow on the temple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gass and Mary Dallory were seated at tea in a sad and sorrowful mood--for the conversation had turned on those dreadful rumours that, in spite of Richard North, would not be hushed. Mrs. Gass was stoutly asserting that she had more faith in Dr. Rane than to believe them, when some commotion in the street dawned on their ears. Mrs. Gass stopped in the midst of an emphatic sentence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s that?\" she cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fleet steps seemed to be running to and fro; voices were raised in excitement. They distinctly heard the words, \"Mr. Richard,\" \"Richard North.\" Mrs. Gass drew aside her crimson curtains, and opened the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Smith--is it you?\" she said, arresting a man who was running in the wake of others. \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t rightly know, ma\u0027am,\" he answered. \"They are saying that Mr. Richard North has been shot dead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lord help us!\" cried Mrs. Gass. She shut down the window and brought her face round to the light again. Every vestige of colour had left it. Mary Dallory stood rigidly upright, her hands clasped, as one who had been turned to stone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you hear what he said, child?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I heard,\" was the scarcely murmured answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gass caught up a bonnet, which happened to lie on a chair, and went into the street. At the entrance to North Inlet a crowd of men and women had gathered. As in all similar cases, reports varied. Some said it had taken place in the high-road to Whitborough, some at the works, others near Dallory Hall. So the mob was puzzled which way to go and not miss the excitement. Thoms was talking at the top of his voice as Mrs. Gass arrived, anxious, perhaps, to disclaim complicity on his own score.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027ve had it in their heads to do it, some o\u0027 them bad uns have. I could name names, but I won\u0027t. If the master had knowed all, he\u0027d ha\u0027 went about in fear of his life this long while past.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was enough for Mrs. Gass. Gathering her black silk skirts in her hands, and her face paler than the assemblage had ever seen it, she stood, unmindful of the rain, and told them what she thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you\u0027ve shot Richard North, you have shot the best and bravest man you\u0027ll ever know in this life. You\u0027ll never find such a friend again. Ay, he was brave. Brave for good in the midst of difficulties, brave to forbear. Don\u0027t you boast, Thoms, with your ready tongue. None of you men round me now may be the one that\u0027s shot him, but you\u0027ve been all rowing in the same boat. Yes, you have. You mayn\u0027t have planned out murder yourselves--I wouldn\u0027t answer for it that you\u0027ve not--but, any way, you knew that others was a-planning it, and you winked at it and kept silence. Who has been the friend to you that Richard North has been? Since you\u0027ve been half starving, and your wives and children\u0027s been half starving, where has all the help come from, d\u0027you suppose, that has kept you from starving outright? Why, from him. The most has come from him. The money I gave was his, the things I bought was mostly paid for by him. A little came from me; not much; I was too angry with your folly; but he couldn\u0027t see you quite clam, and he took care you shouldn\u0027t. Look at how you were all helped through the fever; and meat, and bread, and beer given you to get up your strength a bit, after it! Who did all that? Why, Richard North. You thought it was me; but it was him; only he wouldn\u0027t have it known. That was his return for all the black ingratitude you\u0027d showed, in refusing to work for him and bringing him to ruin. Pray God he may not be dead! but if he is, a good man has gone to his reward.--Is that you, Ketler?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it\u0027s me,\" answered Ketler, who was standing in shadow, his face wearing a deeper gloom than the night could cast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When that child of yours died, Cissy--and many a little help did she have in life from him--who but Richard North took care that she shouldn\u0027t be buried by the parish? He met Fanny Jelly, and he put some money into her hand, and charged her to let it be thought it was hers. \u0027They are in distress and trouble, I know, Jelly,\u0027 he said; \u0027let this be used in the way that\u0027s best for them.\u0027 Go and ask Jelly, if you don\u0027t believe me: I had it from her. And that\u0027s the master you\u0027ve been conspirating together to kill, Ketler!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ketler swallowed down a groan. \"I\u0027d never have raised a hand again the master; no, nor countenanced it. If anybody has said I would, it\u0027s a lie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s not one of you but knew what mischief was in the wind, or might have known it; and you\u0027ve countenanced it by keeping silence,\" retorted Mrs. Gass. \"You are a pack of cowards. First of all you ruin him by throwing up his work, and when you find yourselves all clamming together, or nigh upon it, you turn round on him and kill him. May the Lord forgive you! I never will.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some disturbance. A tramping of feet, and a shouting of running boys. Poole, Denton, John Allen, and one more were marching by in handcuffs, marshalled by some policemen. A hiss greeted them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Twas a mistake,\" said Jack Allen, in answer to the hiss, reckless under his untoward fate. \"\u0027Twas meant for Ralley, not for the master.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is he dead?\" called out Mrs. Gass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But amidst the confusion she received no answer. And at that moment she became aware of a pale countenance near her, peeping out from a cloud of wool.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good gracious, Miss Mary, child! You shouldn\u0027t be out here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have been with you all the time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then, my dear, you just betake yourself home again. I\u0027ll come in as soon as I can learn the truth of it all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gass had not long to wait. Almost as she spoke, Richard North appeared: and thereupon ensued more excitement than ever. Blood was trickling from his temple, but he appeared quite sensible, and was walking slowly, helped by two men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank God!\" said Mrs. Gass aloud: and the words were heartily echoed. \"To my house, men. Mr. Richard, sir, it is but a few steps more, and we\u0027ll soon have the doctor. A fine night\u0027s work, this is!\" she concluded, leading the way to her home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Little Barrington, the druggist, came out of his shop, and helped to place Richard on Mrs. Gass\u0027s sofa. They managed to get off his coat. The left arm was injured, as well as the temple. Barrington staunched the blood trickling from the latter; but preferred not to meddle with the arm. \"He had better be kept quite quiet, until the surgeon comes,\" said the druggist to Mrs. Gass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gass cleared the room. A dozen excited messengers had run to the Ham for Mr. Seeley or Dr. Rane, or both if they should be found at home. She stood at the front-door, watching and waiting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richard North, weak and faint, lay with his eyes closed. Opening them in the quiet room, he saw Mary Dallory kneeling by the sofa, pale and sad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be alarmed,\" he whispered. \"It might have been worse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would have given my life to save yours, Richard,\" she impetuously exclaimed in the sorrow and terror of the moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His right hand went out a little and met hers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Richard, I wish I might stay and nurse you. You have no sister. Matilda is useless in a sick-room.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richard North nervously pressed her fingers. \"Don\u0027t try me too much, Mary. I care for you already more than is good for my peace. Don\u0027t tempt me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And if I were to tempt you? Though I don\u0027t quite know what you mean,\" she rejoined softly and nervously. \"What then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I might say what I ought not to say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He paused.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It would make it all the harder for me,\" he continued, after a moment\u0027s silence. \"I am a man of the people; a man of work. You will belong to--to one of a different order.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She knew he alluded to Arthur Bohun, and laughed slightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But, though she said no more, she left her hand in his. Richard thought it was done solely out of compassion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now there was a bustle heard, and in came Mr. Seeley, warm with hastening. The hands parted, and Mary Dallory went round to the other side of the table, and stood there in all due decorum.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2687/74005.html","bookId":1481,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:55:07 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:55:07 AM"}
