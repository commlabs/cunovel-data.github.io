He\u0027d taken Gia and Vicky home from Weezy\u0027s, then returned here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Storm\u0027s done. You\u0027re sure he\u0027s still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Glaeken and the Lady nodded from their customary places at the table. Weezy was in her place too, the Compendium open before her. And next to her, a new face: Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder different circumstances, Jack would have been amused at his reaction to seeing Mrs. Clevenger alive and well, and finally meeting the mysterious \"Mr. Foster.\" Even though Weezy had prepared him, he\u0027d been awestruck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver in the corner, Dawn\u0027s baby, confined in a playpen, contentedly chewed on a bone - a freaking soup bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Eddie had seen him he\u0027d whispered a simple, \"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he hadn\u0027t done a Kramer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken said, \"And slowly, very slowly, growing stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot what Jack wanted to hear. A supernova of frustration blazed in his chest. He\u0027d blown it. His original plan had been sabotaged - unintentionally, but sabotaged nonetheless - and he\u0027d been forced to improvise. But he couldn\u0027t excuse himself. He\u0027d blown it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get back to Nuckateague.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what possible purpose?\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at her. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. To toast some marshmallows over the ashes of Rasalom\u0027s mansion. What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was walking a thin line here and he didn\u0027t need anyone baiting him with stupid questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious, Jack. You\u0027ve seen the news. That whole area is crawling with state and local cops. Even Homeland Security is into the act. The Coast Guard found the wreckage of the cabin cruiser, so they\u0027re out on the water patrolling the bay, looking for bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Rasalom is not a body. And he\u0027s not in the water. I don\u0027t care how resilient he is, he\u0027s saddled with a human body. It may be a special human body, but human muscle can\u0027t function in near-freezing water like they\u0027ve got in that bay. Somehow he made it to shore - maybe somewhere along the South Fork, maybe Gardiner\u0027s Island, I don\u0027t know. But he\u0027s on land, and he\u0027s hurt, and he\u0027s hiding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t disagree,\" Weezy said. \"And if he\u0027s findable, he\u0027ll be found. But not by you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think, will you?\" she snapped. \"You\u0027ll be conspicuous as all hell out there. If you\u0027re poking through the bushes on land, the cops or DHS will want to know who you are and what you\u0027re doing there. If you somehow find a boat to take out, the Coast Guard will want to know the same things. If there\u0027s a chink anywhere in your ID you\u0027ll wind up in jail and completely out of the fight. Is that what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced a smile. \"I hate it when you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued her stare. \"Funny. You didn\u0027t used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not exactly who I used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you seem to be getting less like him every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack glanced at Glaeken and remembered what he\u0027d said last night about the Ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ally wants a tool ... a relentless tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his hands in surrender. \"Peace. You\u0027re right, I\u0027m wrong. I\u0027m open to suggestions - anything but \u0027let\u0027s just sit back and see what happens.\u0027 Anything but that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Weezy said. \"Let\u0027s play a game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weez...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m serious. And this is a serious game.\" She closed the Compendium and stood it up on its spine. \"Guess which page it will open to when I let go of its covers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she lost her mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weez...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to guess the page about the Otherness Naming Ceremony.\" She let the covers go and the book fell open. She looked down and said, \"Well, well. What do you know: the Otherness Naming Ceremony. Let me try it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about that? The Otherness Naming Ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack moved around for a look. Sure enough. He recognized the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called Eddie over and he got the same result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack took the book from her and tried it himself: same page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew this book. Before Weezy had come back into his life and taken over the Compendium, he\u0027d owned it, studied it - or at least tried to until its sequencing went on the fritz and pages began appearing in random order, anywhere they damn well pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all his time with the book it had never done anything like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since coming across that first reference on Wednesday I\u0027ve been finding more and more mentions of the Other Naming Ceremony. Think about that: In all those months, not one reference till last week, then one after another, and now the book won\u0027t open to any other page.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another malfunction in its pagination?\" Glaeken said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I showed it to Gia this morning and she said it looked like the book was trying to tell me something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack laughed. \"Yeah, but she was - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - joking, or at least half joking, sure. But it got me to thinking. Could it be trying to tell me something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a book, Weez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the Compendium isn\u0027t like any other book in the world, maybe not like any book ever made - and I emphasize ever. I\u0027ve been studying it a long time. I\u0027ve become attuned to it. It\u0027s kind of, well, almost interactive, and I\u0027m wondering if maybe it\u0027s somehow become attuned to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack didn\u0027t know what to make of this. A book - even the most maddening and amazing book in the world - trying to tell them something? It didn\u0027t sit right. His instinct was to reject the idea out of hand. But Weezy had instincts too, and he\u0027d learned to respect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Glaeken cleared his throat. \"What do you think it\u0027s trying to tell us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That maybe what we talked about when I first showed you the page is a way to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack vaguely remembered. \"Putting someone through the Naming Ceremony and giving him Rasalom\u0027s Other Name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"That\u0027s it. \u0027No two humans may have the same Other Name. The First-named shall be powerless as long as the Second-named lives.\u0027 That sounds pretty good to me. In fact that sounds like just what we\u0027re looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken said, \"You neglected the rest of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy remedied that: \"\u0027The First-named shall hear the Name within the Second and thus be able to resolve the duplication.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken was nodding. \"Which means the One will be powerless until he hunts down the usurper and wrings his neck. Which won\u0027t be very long if he can \u0027hear the name\u0027 within the unfortunate who has it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs before, Jack was thinking that would be an excellent way to make Rasalom come to him, but he saw a couple of major problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we getting ahead of ourselves?\" He turned to the Lady. \"Once again, I volunteer, but you\u0027re the only one who can perform the ceremony and you\u0027ve already said you won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a death sentence,\" she said, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to Weezy. \"But even if we can change her mind, we don\u0027t know his Other Name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked at him, her expression intense. \"I have an idea where we might - might be able to find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all ears. Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under the Johnson Lodge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previous silence around the table had been baffled. This one felt more like stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Eddie said, \"Johnson? Our Johnson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"You mean those tunnels, that buried town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Remember we came across a big model of the Order\u0027s sigil down there, the one made out of the same black stuff as the little pyramid we found?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had a vague memory of it. He\u0027d archived most of his childhood and pretty much everything else that had happened before his break with his past and arrival in New York. Most of what he could dredge up from their teenage venture into the dark region beneath the Lodge involved running from some bearlike creature they never saw clearly - what might have been the last q\u0027qr - and trying to keep from drowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was damaged, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore like hardly. He remembered finding it and calling Weezy to take a look, but the details ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking frustrated, she pulled a pad and a pen from her backpack and began drawing. When finished she held it up for all to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the sigil as we know it. Check the outer border - the rows of boxes running between the points. Each row has seven boxes.\" She looked at Glaeken. \"Didn\u0027t you tell me that each of the Seven\u0027s Other Names had seven characters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken nodded. \"As do their taken, worldly names - like Rasalom. The original sigil belonged to the Seven. Seven points for the seven agents of the Otherness, interwoven to show a unity of purpose. Each of their public names was carved into the boxes of the great sigil that overlooked the hall where they would meet to draw up their plans for rule by the Otherness. After the Cataclysm, when the Seven and their schemes and their armies were no more, the Order adopted the sigil, but without the names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The great sigil is mentioned here,\" Weezy said, tapping the Compendium. \"But so is another sigil - seven of them, in fact - all engraved with the Other Name of each of the Seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d heard rumors of that back in the First Age,\" Glaeken said. \"But I thought it was just wishful thinking on our part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing their Other Names would give us power over them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack didn\u0027t get it. \"What are we talking about here? It\u0027s just a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shook his head. \"The Conflict was out in the open back then. The laws of nature were different and could be bent in ways no longer possible. The things we could do in the First Age would be called magic now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ll take your word for that. But that makes it all the less likely that they\u0027d share this Other Name with anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken gave a wry smile. \"The Otherness did not cull the Seven from the cream of humanity. They were vicious and ruthless and without honor. Those of us fighting for the Ally were flawed in many ways - some fatally - but compared to the Seven, we were the First Age equivalent of choirboys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the more reason not to let the Hank Thompsons and Ernst Drexlers of their day in on your closest secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever hear of mutually assured destruction?\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he had. \"With nuclear weapons, yeah, but names?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken was nodding. \"It does make a sort of sense. If one of them or even a pair of them went rogue, the others had the means to bring them into line or wipe them off the face of the Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy started erasing parts of her drawing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, what if I told you we came upon a sigil, six feet high or so, and certain parts of it were missing?\" She held up the edited drawing. \"What if it looked like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" she said. \"Six of the seven borders have been removed. Only one remains - and that\u0027s got a name on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken leaned forward, keen interest sparking in his blue eyes. \"What name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back. \"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s why I put little X\u0027s in the boxes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack couldn\u0027t hide his shock. \"You mean you forgot? You never forget anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt I ever knew, Jack.\" She closed her eyes. \"I can see it there, leaning against the wall of the tunnel. It\u0027s covered with dust. You even rubbed off some of the dust to show me how it was made of the same black material as the pyramid. I can see that six of the borders are missing, and I have an impression of seven symbols on the remaining border, but for the life of me I can\u0027t remember what they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That photographic memory of yours never failed before. Why now? Try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes opened and flashed at him. \"What do you think I\u0027m doing right now? It\u0027s simply not there. You remember what it was like that night. We thought that door opened into some kind of floor safe but it was much bigger than that. It was dark down there, we had crummy little flashlights, I was nervous, and we were looking for a lost kid. So excuse me if I didn\u0027t pay a whole lot of attention to a dusty old sigil. I can\u0027t remember something if it never registered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized he\u0027d ticked her off. He hadn\u0027t meant to. He couldn\u0027t remember ever being so impatient. He also realized she was ticked at herself for not being able to remember it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Sorry. If that\u0027s the way it is, we\u0027ll just have to resign ourselves to not knowing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can find out,\" she said. \"I mean, assuming the sigil is still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it is, it\u0027s got to be buried under a ton of mud from when the lake flooded in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, maybe not. I think we should go see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where? Back to Johnson? What for?\" He nodded to the Lady. \"If no one\u0027s going to perform the ceremony, why bother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can worry about ceremonies later. Just knowing Rasalom\u0027s Other Name could be important. Don\u0027t you want to know it? Aren\u0027t you curious, even a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t go back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way he was leaving for the wilds of New Jersey while Rasalom\u0027s heart was still ticking up here. If an opportunity arose to finish the job, Jack wanted to be ready to jump on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was that son of a bitch? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-67.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
