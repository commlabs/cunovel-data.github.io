She had tossed them shortly after I\u0027d left Sunday, not long after his phone call. It seemed to me, though, that I could still feel their presence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You won\u0027t leave town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might be safer out of the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. I don\u0027t want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he can get into the building-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I spoke to them. They\u0027re keeping the service entrance bolted from inside. It\u0027s to be opened only when one of the porters or doormen is present, and it\u0027ll be refastened after each use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was fine, if they stuck to it. But you couldn\u0027t count on it, and there were just too many ways to get into an apartment building, even a well-staffed one like hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"What about you, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I came pretty close to throwing a fit in Durkin\u0027s office. He as much as accused me of- well, I told you all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went there intending to accomplish two things. I was going to swear out a complaint against Motley. The son of a bitch worked me over pretty good last night. That\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to do, isn\u0027t it? If you\u0027re a private citizen? Somebody assaults you, you\u0027re supposed to go to the police and report it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they taught us in tenth-grade civics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told me the same thing. They didn\u0027t tell me how pointless it would turn out to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the bathroom and there was blood in my urine again, and my kidney throbbed as I returned to the living room. Something must have shown in my face, because she asked what was the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just thinking,\" I said. \"The other thing I wanted from Durkin was for him to help me fill out an application for a pistol permit and rush it through. After the routine he gave me I didn\u0027t even bother mentioning it.\" I shrugged. \"It probably wouldn\u0027t have done any good. They wouldn\u0027t issue me a carry permit, and I can\u0027t keep a loaded gun in my top dresser drawer and hope the bastard comes over for tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re afraid, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so. I don\u0027t feel it but it has to be there. The fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fear for other people\u0027s safety. You, Anita, Jan. It stands to reason that I\u0027m at least as much afraid of getting killed myself, but I\u0027m not really aware of it. There\u0027s this book I\u0027ve been trying to read, the private thoughts of a Roman emperor. One of the themes he keeps coming back to is that death is nothing to be afraid of. The point he makes is that since it\u0027s inevitable sooner or later, and since you\u0027re just as dead no matter how old you are when you die, then it doesn\u0027t really matter how long you live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you live. How you face up to life- and to death, as far as that goes. That\u0027s what I\u0027m really afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I\u0027ll screw up. That I\u0027ll do what I shouldn\u0027t, or fail to do what I should. That one way or another I\u0027ll turn out to be a day late and a dollar short and not quite good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was down when I left her apartment, and the sky was darkening. I set out intending to walk back to my hotel, but I was breathing heavily before I\u0027d covered two blocks. I walked over to the curb and held up a hand for a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t eaten anything all day aside from a hard roll for breakfast and a slice of pizza for lunch. I walked into a deli to pick up something for dinner but walked out again before it was my turn to order. I didn\u0027t have any appetite and the smell of food turned my stomach. I went up to my room and got there just in time to throw up. I wouldn\u0027t have thought I\u0027d have had enough in my stomach to manage it, but evidently I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process was painful, involving muscles that were sore from the night before. When I was done heaving a wave of dizziness took me and I had to cling to the doorjamb for support. When it passed I walked to my bed, moving with the deliberate mincing steps of an old man walking the deck of a storm-tossed ship. I threw myself down on the bed, breathing like a beached whale, and I wasn\u0027t there for more than a minute or two before I had to get up and stagger back into the bathroom to pee. I stood there swaying and watched the bowl fill up with red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfraid he\u0027d kill me? Jesus, he\u0027d be doing me a favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang an hour or so later. It was Jan Keane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" she said. \"If I remember correctly, you don\u0027t want to know where I\u0027m calling from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so it\u0027s out of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s that, all right. I almost didn\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all seemed overly dramatic, can you understand that? When I drank I was always addicted to that kind of high drama. Jump up, grab a toothbrush, call a taxi, and grab the next plane to San Diego. That\u0027s not where I am, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in the cab, heading for the airport, and the whole thing seemed bizarre and out of proportion. I almost told the driver to turn the cab around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just drama, is it? It\u0027s real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I needed a vacation anyway. I can always look at it that way. Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound, I don\u0027t know. Exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been an exhausting day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t push yourself too hard, all right? I\u0027ll call every few days, if that\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is around now a good time to call? I thought I could have a good chance of finding you in before you left to go to a meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s usually a good time,\" I said. \"Of course my schedule\u0027s a little erratic right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she? \"But call every few days,\" I said, \"and I\u0027ll let you know if things clear up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean when they clear up, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be what I mean,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t get to a meeting. I thought about it, but when I stood up I realized I didn\u0027t want to go anywhere. I got back into bed and closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened them a little while later to the sound of sirens outside my window. It was the Rescue Squad, and I watched idly as they hauled someone out of the building across the street on a stretcher and loaded him into the ambulance. They sped off, heading for Roosevelt or St. Clare\u0027s, running with the throttle and the siren both wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they\u0027d been readers of Marcus Aurelius they might have relaxed and taken it easy, knowing that it didn\u0027t make any real difference if they got there on time or not. After all, the poor clown on the stretcher was going to die sooner or later, and everything always happened just the way it was supposed to, so why knock yourself out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got into bed again and dozed off. I think I may have been running a fever, because this time I slept fitfully and came awake drenched in sweat, clawing my way out of some shapeless nightmare. I got up and drew a tub of water, as hot as I could stand it, and I lay gratefully in it, feeling it draw the misery out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in the tub when the phone rang, and I let it ring. When I got out I called down to the desk to see if the caller had left a message, but he hadn\u0027t, and the genius on duty couldn\u0027t remember if it had been a man or a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose it must have been him, but I\u0027ll never know for sure. I didn\u0027t notice what time it was. It could have been anybody, really. I\u0027d passed out my business cards all over town, and any of a thousand people could have been moved to call me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if it was him, and if I\u0027d been there to take the call, it wouldn\u0027t have changed a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the phone rang again I was already awake. The sky was light outside my window and I\u0027d opened my eyes ten or fifteen minutes ago. Any minute now I\u0027d get up and go to the bathroom and find out what color urine I was producing today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the phone and he said, \"Good morning, Scudder,\" and it was chalk on a blackboard again, and an arctic chill that went right through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t remember what I said. I must have said something, but maybe not. Maybe I just sat there holding the goddamned phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I had a busy night. I suppose you\u0027ve already read about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, evidently you don\u0027t. Blood, Scudder. Not the kind you spill, although I\u0027m afraid that did happen. But there\u0027s no sense crying over spilled blood, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grip tightened on the telephone. I felt the anger and impatience rising in me, but I kept a lid on it, refusing to give him the response he seemed to want. I made myself take a breath, and I didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood as in blood ties,\" he said. \"You lost someone near and dear to you. My sympathies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read the paper,\" he said shortly, and he broke the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Anita. While the phone rang I felt as though an iron band was tightening around my chest, but when I heard her voice on the other end of the line I couldn\u0027t think of a thing to say to her. I just sat there as wordless as a heavy breather until she got tired of saying \"hello?\" and hung up on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blood tie, someone near and dear to me. Elaine? Did he know that she was my honorary cousin Frances? It didn\u0027t make sense but I called anyway. The line was busy. I decided he must have killed her and left her phone off the hook, and I got an operator to check and make sure. She did, and reported that the phone was in use. I\u0027d identified myself as a police officer, so she cooperatively offered to break into the call if it was an emergency. I told her not to bother. It might or might not be an emergency, but I didn\u0027t want to talk to Elaine any more than I\u0027d wanted to talk to Anita. I just wanted to assure myself that she was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was looking in my book for phone numbers before the unlikelihood of that struck me. Even if he\u0027d managed to find one of them and chase across the country after him, how could it have made today\u0027s paper? And why didn\u0027t I quit wasting time and go out and buy the paper and read about it, whatever it was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw some clothes on, went downstairs and picked up the News and the Post. They both had the same story headlined on the front page. The Venezuelan family, it turned out, had been killed by mistake. They weren\u0027t drug dealers after all. The Colombians across the street were drug dealers, and the killers had evidently gone to the wrong house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the Flame and sat at the counter and ordered coffee. I opened one of the papers and started going through it without knowing what I was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found it right away. It would have been hard to miss. It was spread all over page 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young woman had been killed in a particularly brutal fashion by a killer or killers who had invaded her home early the previous evening. She was a financial analyst employed by an investment-management corporation headquartered on Wall Street, and she had lived just below Gramercy Park on Irving Place, where she\u0027d occupied the fourth floor of a brownstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo photos ran with the article. One showed an attractive girl with a long face and a high forehead, her expression serious, her gaze level. The other showed the entrance to her building, with police personnel carrying her out in a body bag. The accompanying text stated that the well-appointed apartment had been ransacked by the killer or killers, and that the woman had been subjected to repeated sexual assault and unspecified sadistic mistreatment. The police were withholding details, as was customary in such cases, but the news story did mention that the victim had been decapitated, and one sensed that this was not the only surgery that had been performed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-27.html","bookId":2326,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM"}
