He wrapped the fragile manuscript in a triple layer of old newspapers and tied up the whole thing with brown twine. When he got someplace safe, he\u0027d open it and take a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed back through the window, went through the reading room, and let himself into the hallway beyond. He wove his way through back offices and storage rooms until he found the doorway out, an exit labeled in Czech, German, and English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo alarms sounded. Nobody came after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed up Petrin Hill. He remembered from the map in The Rogue\u0027s Guide that numerous paths crisscrossed the hill. He could lose himself up there in case someone followed, emerge on the other side. Some paths were well lit, others not. The Rogue\u0027s Guide had also mentioned the fact that hookers used the shrubbery as convenient hideaways for quickies. Interesting information but not particularly useful at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Allen stuck to the main path, which was well lit and smoothly paved. He kept heading up. He passed a young couple strolling arm in arm. Harmless, but they could still talk to the police. Have you seen a young man with a stolen alchemist diary? Which way did he go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned onto a gravel path, narrow and dark, but still heading for the top of the hill. From there he could survey his surroundings and decide where to go next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext. Yes, that would be tricky. It was not safe to go back to his dorm; it had been foolish to go there the first time, in fact. Too easy for people to find him. And he didn\u0027t relish returning to Penny\u0027s apartment and having to explain why he\u0027d gone off without her. There would be some hurt feelings there, but time to apologize later. Right now he needed a quiet place to examine Kelley\u0027s journal. A well-lit desk and nobody trying to kidnap, seduce, or kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while seduction was admittedly the least appalling of the options, the sudden thought of Cassandra both terrified and excited Allen, sending conflicting sensations coursing through his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Don\u0027t think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trudged up the path, gravel crunching. He panted with the exertion. Allen wasn\u0027t in bad shape, but the hill went up and up. He\u0027d left the well-lit path far behind now, and the darkness closed in on him. He stepped off the path a few times, had to reorient himself by moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen heard something and froze. Had he heard footsteps, or was it just himself he\u0027d heard? His own panting was loud in his ears. Something rustled in the bushes far back down the path. Bird? Rabbit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began walking again, took another dozen steps and stopped. Okay, he definitely did hear something. Something too large to be a bird or rabbit rustled the bushes. Allen strained his ears, heard a sniffing sound, or maybe it was heavy breathing. There! A dark shape slunk from the bushes, pausing in the middle of the path. Allen\u0027s heart picked up speed. He didn\u0027t move, held his breath. Maybe it would go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt moved, turning toward him. Glowing eyes stabbed him from the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen clutched the manuscript to his chest and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran straight up the path at first, but when he heard the rapid footfalls behind him, he realized his pursuer would overtake him quickly. He took a sharp right turn into the woods, where he dodged among the trees and low branches, stumbling over roots. How did he think getting lost in the woods would help? A sort of strange clarity told him he was panicking. Branches slapped at his face, tugged at his clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing plunged into the woods behind him, pulling closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, I\u0027m going to die I\u0027m going to die I\u0027m going to die I\u0027m going to-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feet flew along the easiest path, turning downhill. He stumbled, and his hands flew out to grab a tree trunk. The manuscript flew away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t pause, didn\u0027t even think of stopping to pick it up. He ran so hard that he thought his heart would explode. Sweat drenched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA howl split the night-a single note, deep and clear, rising above the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen went cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered a small clearing, knew he couldn\u0027t run anymore. He would collapse any minute. He picked up a fallen branch and turned, backed up to the other side of the clearing, the branch held feebly in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the eyes first. It stepped into the clearing, moonlight giving it shape. An enormous dog. No. A wolf. Reddish-brown fur. Allen blinked. It was the same animal he\u0027d seen so many months ago in the woods behind Professor Evergreen\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s. Fucking. Impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a step toward him, and Allen raised the branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf threw its head back and howled again. Allen trembled. Allen waited to die as he imagined fangs tearing out his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf didn\u0027t budge. A moment stretched. It howled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sensed movement down the hill, heard somebody clumsily trudging through the bushes. Allen opened his mouth to yell for help, but his voice caught, fear choking him to silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf howled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistantly, a woman\u0027s voice whined, \"Okay. I heard you, for Christ\u0027s sake. I\u0027m coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf nodded its head, pawed at the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushes rustled to Allen\u0027s left, startling him. A woman stumbled into the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen\u0027s eyes popped. \"Amy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy panted, held an armload of clothes. \"Uphill? Is this revenge for dragging you up Zizkov?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, stop. There\u0027s a wolf.\" He pointed with the branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" She plopped butt first onto the grass, still out of breath. \"Try not to freak out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy pointed at the wolf. \"Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animal began to shake, going into rapid convulsions. It made pained sounds, whined and growled. Its back arched. Limbs began to stretch and elongate horribly, its muzzle distorting and flattening into a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen could not imagine a more horrifying sight than this creature melting and deforming, redefining itself, fur melting into flesh, this monster growing more familiar by the second. A scream. Human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay momentarily in a fetal position, then stood on shaky legs, hands going to mussed hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Penny,\" breathed Allen. \"Oh, my God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen\u0027s world tilted dramatically. So many questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny stood naked, white and curved in the radiant moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson Fay checked himself and the girls into a suite at the opulent Carlo IV hotel. He would plan his next move in comfort. He would need to locate Evergreen. He would need to determine if the man was a threat or not, prepare both defensive and offensive spells. Better to be over-prepared than under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at the moment, he was famished. Room service brought three carts of food and two chilled buckets of champagne. Fay had been embezzling from the Society for three years in preparation for his break with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover gulped a glass of champagne like it was ginger ale. \"This beats the hell out of the service tunnels underneath Zizkov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam reached for a shrimp cocktail. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could get used to this.\" Clover stuck a cigarette into her mouth, flipped open her Zippo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t smoke,\" Fay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover froze, the flame halfway to her cigarette. \"Sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the smell,\" Fay said. \"You have your own room. Smoke in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Right. Okay. I\u0027ll suck a quick one. Back in a minute.\" She went into her room and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She smokes too much.\" Sam popped a shrimp into her mouth, chewed as she refilled her champagne glass. \"Is there a spell for lung cancer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should discover one.\" Fay sat back in his chair, looked at Sam. Long legs, tan. Athletic. Not very feminine in T-shirt, denim shorts, and hiking boots, but he could tell there was a good figure under there, and now that he\u0027d eaten, Fay contemplated satisfying other needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and plucked the rose from the vase on one of the serving trays. Classy place. Fay would never live in middle-class mediocrity again. He would always have just exactly whatever he wanted. This he vowed to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay used the rose thorn to prick his finger, raising a drop of blood. He peeled off one of the rose petals, mashed it between his thumb and forefinger, then mixed the blood with it until it turned into a pink paste. Sam saw none of this as she hovered over a dish of caviar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me refill your glass.\" Fay took it from her, slipped the paste into it, then poured champagne on top, muttering words under his breath. He handed it back to her. \"Drink up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Thanks.\" She sipped, smacked her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately her eyelids grew heavy and a dreamy smile spread across her face. She took a step closer to Fay, a soft purr coming out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should take off your clothes,\" Fay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, set her champagne glass aside. She pulled off her shirt, to reveal heavy breasts held back by a sports bra. She unclasped it, let them fall. Brown nipples poked out like pencil erasers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very nice,\" Fay whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, unzipped her shorts and let them fall, stepped out of them and peeled her white cotton panties down over her hiking boots. Her pubic hair had been cut into a narrow line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped a breast, ran a thumb over a nipple. Sam gasped pleasure. He reached down to her seam, and she closed her eyes, moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay thrilled at the moist warmth. Being the most powerful wizard on the planet was going to work out just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover threw open a window, puffed the cigarette as she gazed upon Prague from her third-story window. Not a lot of traffic this time of night, but this part of the city never did shut down entirely. It was actually a pretty neat town, she thought. If she hadn\u0027t been here on Society business, she would probably have found a number of ways to amuse herself. Maybe catch the night scene, scope out a few bands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then again, she wouldn\u0027t have been here in the first place if it hadn\u0027t been for the Society. She\u0027d jumped at the opportunity. What in the hell would she have done with her life back in Evansville, Indiana? Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the Society that allowed her to go places, do things, be part of something. She couldn\u0027t help thinking she\u0027d bungled things with Allen Cabbot. She puffed, frowned, promised herself she\u0027d do something to make up for it. Prove to Fay and the rest of the Council she wasn\u0027t a fuckup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be kick-ass to get promoted, learn some of the big spells, get in on the real secrets? Damn right. That would be cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should probably get back to Fay. She didn\u0027t want to seem ungrateful. But the bed looked so comfortable. It would be easy just to fall into cool sheets, catch a few hours of shut-eye. She\u0027d been awake nearly the entire time since fleeing Zizkov, only stealing a quick catnap here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover went to the vanity mirror and looked closely at her face. There were dark circles under her eyes, and not the cool kind she did herself with makeup sometimes. Real dark circles. She thought her face suddenly looked ashen too. As a matter of fact, it was getting paler by the second, and wrinkles were forming. What the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old woman\u0027s face replaced her own, emerged from the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motherfucker!\" Clover stumbled back, fell onto the bed, and scooted back all the way to the headboard, her arms flung up to fend off the apparition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me, Clover,\" the old woman said. \"Do not be alarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover blinked, looked more closely at the pale figure, who hovered, mostly transparent, the rest of the room visible behind her. Wait. Clover knew this lady. \"Margaret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, child. Where are the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam is here,\" Clover said. \"We can\u0027t find Amy. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve gone beyond,\" Margaret said. \"But I managed one last spell, something I set up ahead of time just in case. You must listen to me, Clover. Jackson Fay is a traitor. He has betrayed the Council. He murdered Blake and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why else would I appear to you in this fashion?\" asked the ghost. \"Fay has betrayed us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s in the other room right now. With Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flee, child. Go while you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost began to fade. \"I must warn others. My time is limited. It\u0027s... difficult to judge time where I am. I think I\u0027ve only been this way a few short hours, but another part of me feels as if I\u0027ve always been here. So gray and silent. I must go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover sat on the bed, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam. Clover could not-would not-leave without Sam. She went to her backpack to search for something she\u0027d prepared several weeks ago, a spell she\u0027d been afraid to try. Now was the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found the plastic baggy, opened it, put the contents into her pocket. Ash. It seemed only like simple ash, but it had been prepared, with so many ingredients-herbs, a goat\u0027s heart, and the crushed bones of a cripple. She\u0027d had to do a little grave robbing for that one. It had all been mixed and blasted in an iron furnace. If she could catch Fay by surprise, fling it in his eyes and say the words-yes, it might work. He\u0027d be paralyzed for several hours-or maybe only seconds. The old book hadn\u0027t been clear. It was suicide to go against a wizard like Fay toe to toe, but that\u0027s not what she had in mind. She just wanted to slow him down, give herself and Sam a chance to get the hell out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to her bedroom door, put her ear against it but heard nothing. She turned the knob quietly and pushed the door open barely a sliver so she could take a peek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clapped her hand over her own mouth to stifle a surprised gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam reclined naked on the couch, arms and legs spread, a clear invitation. Fay approached her. He was naked too, his erection pulsing at Sam, bobbing as he stepped closer to mount her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover backed away from the door, searched the room with her eyes, and saw a large ceramic vase. She grabbed it, hit the door at full speed on the way into the next room. Fay looked up, startled, then backed away from Sam, his eyes momentarily showing surprise, then narrowing to anger. Clover raised the vase over her head with both hands, grunted, and heaved. It flew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd cracked square against the center of Fay\u0027s forehead, ceramic shards flying in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay cursed, stumbled back over a coffee table, and crashed into the room service carts. A tumult of dishes and silverware. Fay lay groaning, tangled in the tablecloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover was at Sam\u0027s side in a second, grabbed her arm, yanked. \"Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam only looked up at her, that dreamy expression on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it!\" Clover grabbed the closest ice bucket and dumped it on Sam\u0027s head. \"Snap out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam screamed, sputtered. \"What the f-fuck?\" She looked down, saw herself naked, and yelped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay lurched to his feet, a gash on his forehead bleeding freely. He wiped the blood out of his eyes and glared rage at Clover. \"Bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover shoved Sam. \"Run!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam jumped up from the couch, sprinted for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\" Lightning leaped from Fay\u0027s outstretched fingertips, crackled and struck Sam in the back. She froze for a split-second as the entire room went white. Then she collapsed, eyes rolled back, mouth hanging open, smoke rising from her dead body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You son of a bitch.\" Clover spun on Fay. She reached into her pocket, came out with a handful of ash, and flung it into his eyes, the long-memorized command words tumbling from her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay bent down, grabbed a napkin from the wrecked room service cart, and wiped the ash from his face. Then he began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Clover shook her head, couldn\u0027t believe it. I did everything right. I know I did. It should have worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surprised?\" Fay asked. \"Poor little girl can\u0027t make her magic work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled in her eyes. No. There had been a mistake. This wasn\u0027t right. Sam. Was Sam really dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover turned, ran for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay cut her off, grabbed an arm, twisted it behind her back. Pain lanced up through her shoulder, and she went rigid. Suddenly there was a blade at her throat. She wept, fat tears rolling down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You spoiled the party,\" Fay said. \"Now, why would you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I...\" What could she say? Oh, Sam. Poor Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have let you join in,\" Fay said. \"Would that have been so bad? All I needed was a ride from the airport, and if you\u0027re not going to provide me with any entertainment, then I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re no longer of any use, young lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClover drew a breath for a scream, but nobody ever heard it. Fay\u0027s blade bit quick and deep. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-19.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
