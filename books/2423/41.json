No one here knows the history. I need you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chadwick—oh, God. If you\u0027d told me that a week ago . . . a month ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her despair pulling at his ear, as if they were children, speaking through a wall with cups and string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll try to arrange something,” she said at last, when he didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call me with flight information. I\u0027ll meet you at the airport.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her his cell phone number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just find Mallory,” Ann said. “Please . . . if I lose her . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick tried to say something reassuring, but Ann had already hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the gravel road, at the limestone-columned gates of Cold Springs, Asa Hunter was talking to the sheriff and a plainclothes detective. He turned, wearing that same look of cold anger he\u0027d had years before when he\u0027d impaled the blade of his knife in a live oak. He saw Chadwick, motioned him forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick wasn\u0027t worried about the sheriff—old Bob Kreech was as easy to understand as a water moccasin. But something about the plainclothes officer was wrong. He looked too young. His suit was too nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mallory made it as far as the road,” Hunter told Chadwick. “They found this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a compass—the cheap plastic model all black levels were given for Survival Week training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They found fresh tire ruts nearby,” Hunter said. “A large vehicle pulled over. One guess, she flagged down a truck, hitched a ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne guess, Chadwick thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The shooter?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dead.” Sheriff Kreech studied Chadwick, waiting for a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chadwick\u0027s a hero,” Hunter said. “He protected our kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man—the young plainclothes officer—was staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething clicked in Chadwick\u0027s brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re Special Agent Laramie,” he said. “From San Francisco.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man smiled thinly. “You\u0027re a difficult man to catch up with, Mr. Chadwick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick had worked with the FBI on runaway cases a few times. He\u0027d seen enough to know that when agents smiled, it was generally not a good sign. “The shooting was only an hour ago,” Chadwick said. “What did you do—teleport?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got in this afternoon. Booked the flight right after yours.” Laramie asked, “You don\u0027t know the shooter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His name was Julio de la Garza. ID in his pocket identified him as a Mexican national. I made some inquiries. Guy was ex-military. Had an interesting career before he was discharged—torched a house full of rebel sympathizers down in Chiapas, turned out to be Mayan schoolchildren. Last few years, he\u0027s been living in the Mission in San Francisco. Your old neighborhood, isn\u0027t it, Mr. Chadwick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A long time ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it surprise you to learn that there were two shooters?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaramie\u0027s eyes were bright, almost glassy, but intently focused on Chadwick. With that little smile pulling up the corners of his mouth, the special agent could\u0027ve been a kid playing a lethal video game he understood intuitively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter said, “Sheriff found casings at a different spot about twenty yards away—second guy was flanking the first, probably took a hike when you sent his buddy airborne.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pérez,” Chadwick said. “The second shooter was Emilio Pérez.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Employee to Mr. John Zedman,” Laramie said. “Now why would you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pérez was sent to retrieve the girl. Maybe to kill me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can prove this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pérez is still out there. He\u0027s got Mallory or he\u0027s looking for her. He might not even know his boss is dead yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Missing,” Laramie corrected. “Not dead. Slip of the tongue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick felt his fists curl. “Pérez and the girl didn\u0027t get along, Mr. Laramie. If Pérez finds out his boss is dead—that he\u0027s suddenly unemployed and he\u0027s got a young girl who\u0027s undeliverable merchandise—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” the sheriff interrupted, raising his hands. “I\u0027m telling you, I ain\u0027t convinced these shooters were after anybody. Two idiots in the woods with rifles during hunting season—that ain\u0027t exactly a first. These guys spotted an opportunity to make some mischief and they took it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one contradicted him. The silence made it clear enough nobody believed him, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn\u0027t see a second shooter,” Laramie told Chadwick. “You didn\u0027t have any visual ID on this Emilio Pérez, or whoever it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The second shooter just disappeared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Possibly with the girl,” Chadwick said. “And we\u0027re standing here talking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, the girl left under her own steam,” Sheriff Kreech insisted. “Who wouldn\u0027t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter\u0027s neck muscles tensed, but he said nothing. He had to live with Bob Kreech, even if Kreech had been elected several times on a promise of closing down Hunter\u0027s campus to “safeguard the community.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaramie kept his eyes locked on Chadwick. “The firing started while you were still in sight. How long exactly were you out of sight from the rest of the group, would you say, while you did your act of heroism?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you getting at?” Hunter said. “Chadwick did nothing wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Laramie agreed easily. “Just that he appears to be real good with a knife. Woman in Oakland, Talia Montrose—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get the hell off my property,” Hunter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can\u0027t put this conversation off much longer, Mr. Chadwick,” Laramie continued, ignoring Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Phone my lawyers in the morning,” Hunter told him. “Until then, Agent Laramie, get the hell out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaramie picked a clump of Spanish moss off the tree branch above him before replying. “I\u0027m here to help, Mr. Chadwick. Think about it. I\u0027ll be back tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to one of the police cars, twirling the ball of moss between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Hunter,” Kreech said, “perhaps you\u0027d give me another few words in private?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff knew damn well that Hunter\u0027s title was Doctor, but he stubbornly resisted using it. Chadwick turned before he could lose his temper, walked back up the road to where Olsen and Jones were waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Jones asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick filled them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where does the fucking FBI get off?” Jones asked. Her eyes burned with pride for her partner. “You took that guy out with a hunting knife. He deserved it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen was not burning with pride. Chadwick got the feeling she shared his discomfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two shooters,” she said. “They could\u0027ve killed you and Mallory—all of us. So why didn\u0027t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick had no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ve got to find her,” Olsen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKindra pushed her on her bad shoulder—the one Mallory had stabbed. “We? Girl, you\u0027re the one who lost her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen winced. “Smart was hurt. I didn\u0027t think—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got the last part right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kindra,” Chadwick said. “Check a car out of the pool. Meet me at the gate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKindra waited for Olsen to return her challenge. Olsen didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem,” Kindra told Chadwick. “I\u0027ll try to get us something fast. Something dependable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and stormed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter and Kreech were still talking by the sheriff\u0027s car. Special Agent Laramie sat in the back seat of the police car, talking on his cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You warned me on Thanksgiving,” Olsen told Chadwick, “you told me to watch out for her. And I promised her I wasn\u0027t going to leave her for any reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn\u0027t your fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to go with you. I want to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They need you here. Leyland will have his hands full calming down the other kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won\u0027t matter. He\u0027ll cancel Survival Week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Chadwick said. “Hunter won\u0027t. He\u0027ll want them back in the woods as soon as possible. Order restored. The program goes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s Hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater was dripping from the roof of the Big Lodge, slower and slower, thickening into nubs of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I failed her,” Olsen said. “Out on the ropes course, when Mallory started to fall. I understood how you felt, that day you almost let Race Montrose kill you. I just stood there . . . I let Leyland handle it. I should\u0027ve been out on the ropes. I froze.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027ll be all right.” Chadwick tried to sound more confident than he felt. “I\u0027ll find her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen pulled her collar tighter around her throat. “Damn weather. I move to Texas and it freezes over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police lights pulsed on the back of her coat as she walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter shook hands reluctantly with the sheriff, then turned and came over to Chadwick. They watched the police cars disappear down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t have to tell you this is a nightmare for the school,” Hunter said. “A kid escaping—that\u0027s worse than the shooting. Compromises the whole program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We both know those were no hunters in the woods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe. Maybe Kreech knows it, too. We also know how much the lazy SOB will follow up. He never wanted us in this county. He\u0027d be delighted to have us shut down by a scandal. As for Laramie, he doesn\u0027t give a damn about the girl. He\u0027s already on to the main course—you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s up to us to find her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter glanced at Chadwick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is what I do,” Chadwick reminded him. “I find kids and I bring them in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re in enough trouble,” Hunter reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Mallory got a ride, the driver might\u0027ve stopped for the night. There aren\u0027t too many options out here. I need to get moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if this Pérez got her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let\u0027s hope like hell he didn\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter pondered that. “I\u0027ll need to call the mother. Get her approval.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve already done it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ll go by standard policy,” Chadwick promised. “Treat it like any pickup on a runaway. Jones goes with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter\u0027s boot traced two lines in the gravel before he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chadwick, in case you were wondering, I\u0027ll back you up one hundred percent. They try to get to you, my lawyers are at your disposal, but you have to watch your ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a new darkness in Hunter\u0027s eyes—the look of someone who\u0027d just seen something evil and was trying to burn it out of his mind. Chadwick realized that Hunter\u0027s conversation with the sheriff and Laramie had not been about Mallory—not entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They asked you to sacrifice me,” Chadwick guessed. “Make me the scapegoat and spare the school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one asked me anything,” Hunter said. “I\u0027m just telling you, I\u0027ll stand by you, but we play this very, very carefully.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-41.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM"}
