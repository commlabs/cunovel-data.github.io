Opening my eyes, I see it is the searchlights of hovering helicopters pointing down on me. Only they are high in the air, and I am many feet underwater, on my back, on the bottom of the lake. Even though unconscious, my mind must have had the wisdom to halt my breathing. I don\u0027t know how long I have been out. My head still hurts but the pain is bearable. It is obvious that the personnel in the helicopters cannot see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder how Joel is, if he escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy left leg is pinned under the wreckage of my chopper. It is good because otherwise I would be floating on the surface, probably with many bullet holes in me. Pulling my leg free, I roll over on my belly and begin to swim away from the lights, not sure at first if I am moving deeper into the lake or closer to the shore. My desire for breath is strong but not overwhelming. I know I can swim a long way before I\u0027ll have to surface. They can\u0027t scan every square inch of the lake. I am going to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there will be no freedom for me if Joel is not free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, when the lights are far behind me, I allow myself to swim to the surface and peek. I am far out in the center of the lake. Behind me, near the shore where my chopper was blown out of the sky, the helicopters still circle, their beams still focused on the water. Close to this spot, on the shore, are several trucks, many uniformed people, some cops, some army personnel. Joel stands in the middle of them, a dozen guns pointed at his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" I whisper. \"He really couldn\u0027t swim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot rush in to save him. I know this yet I have to stop myself from making the attempt. It is my nature to act quickly. Patience has not come to me over the centuries. Floating in the center of the black lake, it seems to me the years have only brought grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel is ushered into an armored truck. Men on the shore are donning scuba gear. They want my body, they want to see it before they can rest. I know that I must act quickly if I am to track Joel. Yet I also know I have to stop killing. They\u0027ll be looking for any suspi?cious deaths in the area as a way to confirm I am still alive. A throbbing sensation in my forehead draws my attention. I reach up and pull away a chunk of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshrapnel that has been working its way out of my skull. Before the infusion of Yaksha\u0027s blood, such an injury would have killed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swim for the shore where Joel is being held, but a mile to the left, away from him and the dam. I am a better swimmer than most dolphins and reach land in a few minutes. No one sees me as I slip out of the water and dash into the rocky hills. My first impulse is to creep closer to the armed assembly. Yet I cannot steal one of their vehicles to follow Joel. Fretting about the growing gap between us, I turn away from the small army and run toward the campgrounds. Even in the winter, families come to Lake Mead to enjoy the nature. Overhead, an almost full moon shines down on me. Just what I don\u0027t need. If an Apache spots me again, I swear, I am going to jump up and grab its skids and take it over. My turn to fire the rockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thoughts are idle, the mental chatter of a natural born predator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find a family of three asleep in a tent on the outskirts of the campground, their shiny new Ford Bronco parked nearby and waiting for me to steal. Silently, I break the lock and slip in behind the steering wheel. It takes me all of two seconds to hot-wire the vehicle. Then I am off, the window down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout my long life, hearing has always been ray best sense. I can hear snowflakes as they emerge from a cloud two miles overhead. Indeed, I have no trouble hearing the army\u0027s motor parade start their engines and pull away from the lake. Probably the commander thinks he should get Joel to a secure place, even before the body of the blond witch is found. I use my ears to follow them as they move onto a road that leads away from the lake. Yet, with my nose in the air, it is my sense of smell that is the most acute. It startles me. I can smell Joel--even in the midst of the others--clearly, in fact. I suspect this is another gift of Yaksha, master yakshini, born of a demonic race of serpents. Snakes always have excep?tional senses of smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am grateful for this newfound sense because I can accurately trail the military parade from a great distance. These people are not stupid--they will check to see if they are being followed. Once again I am struck by my ability to sense their thoughts. I have always been able to discern emotions in mortals, but never ideas. Yaksha must have been an outright mind reader. He never told me. I know for sure the people up ahead are checking their backs. I allow the distance between us to grow to as much as fifteen miles. Naturally I drive with the lights out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first the group heads in the direction of Las Vegas. Then, five miles outside the City of Sin, they turn east onto a narrow paved road. The column stretches out and I have to stay even farther back. There are many signs: RESTRICTED AREA. I believe we are headed to some sort of government base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hunch is confirmed less than an hour later. Approximately fifty miles outside of Las Vegas, the armored vehicle carrying Joel disappears into an elaborately defended camp. I speed up and take my Bronco off the road, parking it behind a hill a mile from both the road and the camp. On foot, I scamper toward the installation, growing more amazed with every step at how complex and impenetrable it ap?pears. The surrounding fence is over a hundred feet high, topped with billowy coils of barbed wire. Ordi?narily I could jump such a barrier without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, the place has manned towers equipped with machine guns and grenade launchers every two hundred feet. That\u0027s a lot of towers. The compound is huge, at least a half mile across. In addition to the towers and fence, there is a densely packed maze of three-foot high electronic devices-- they resemble metal baseball bats--stretched along the perimeter. I suspect that if tripped they emit a paralyzing field. Vampires are sensitive to electricity. I was once hit by a bolt of lightning and spent the next three days recovering in a coffin. My boyfriend at the time wanted to bury me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side of the compound is devoted almost exclu?sively to a concrete runway. I remember reading about a top-secret government installation in the desert outside of Las Vegas that supposedly tests advanced fighter craft, nuclear weapons, and biological weap-ons. I have a sneaking suspicion that I am looking at it. The compound backs into a large barren hill, and I believe the military has mined deep into the natural slope to perform experiments best hidden from the eyes of spy satellites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are Sherman tanks and Apache helicopters parked close to barrack-like structures. No doubt the weapons can be manned in ten seconds. One thing is immediately clear to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not be able to break into the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot and get out alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armored vehicle carrying Joel has halted near the center of the compound. Armed soldiers scurry to line up around it, their weapons drawn and leveled. A cruel-faced general with a single star on his shoulder and death in his eyes approaches the vehicle. Behind him is a group of white-clad scientists--just what I don\u0027t want to see. The general signals to somebody out of view and the side door on the armored vehicle swings open. Heavily chained, his shoulders bowed down, Joel is brought into the open. The general approaches him, strangely unafraid, and searches him. Then he glances over his shoulder. Several of the scientists seem to nod. I don\u0027t understand the ex?change. What are they approving? That Joel is a genuine vampire? They don\u0027t know about vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or do they?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s not possible. For the last two thousand years or more, Yaksha and I were the only vampires on earth. Recently there have been others, of course. But Ray\u0027s conversion was short-lived, Eddie was a psy?chotic aberration, and I destroyed all of Eddie\u0027s offspring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr did I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis general wanted us taken alive, I realize. He\u0027s the one who gave the order to the Apache pilots. They waited a long time before they used their rockets, and then only when they were forced to. In fact, the general is probably angry that they used them at all. The way he\u0027s studying Joel--it\u0027s almost as if he\u0027s gloating. The general wants something from Joel, and he knows what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel is taken inside a building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general confers with one scientist and then they, too, go inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit back and groan. \"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy objective is dear. I have to get Joel out of the compound before they can perform extensive tests on him--more specifically, before they can analyze his blood. I\u0027m not even sure what they will find, but whatever they discover, it won\u0027t bode well for the long-term survival of the human race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I cannot force my way inside. Therefore, I must sneak in. How do I do that? Make friends with the guards? Seduce Mr. Machine Gun Mike? The idea may not be as farfetched as it seems with my magnetic per?sonality and hypnotic eyes. But from what I can see, all the men live at the compound. This is unfortunate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance in the direction of Las Vegas, neon fallout on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the boys must leave the compound and go out on the town now and then,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is two hours before dawn. While I study the compound with my powerful eyes, searching for a vulnerable spot, I see the scientist whom the general conferred with climb into an ordinary car. He stops at a checkpoint before exiting the compound. By then I am running for my Bronco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to talk to this scientist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I climb in my stolen vehicle, I notice that my arms and hands are glowing with a faint white light. The effect stuns me. My face is also glowing! In fact, all my exposed skin shines with the same iridescence as the full moon, which hangs low in the sky in the direction of Las Vegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of radiation are they fooling with out here?\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to worry about it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientist is a speed demon. He drives close to a hundred all the way to Las Vegas, or at least until he hits the public highway, five miles outside the town. I push the Bronco to keep up. I suppose no cop will give him a ticket on a government road. It is my hope he lives in Vegas, but when he goes straight to the Mirage Hotel, my hopes sink. He\u0027s probably just out for a few hours of fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI park near him in the lot and prepare to follow him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remember what I am wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ripped flak jacket and bloody clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not panic. The people I stole the Bronco from are on vacation. They will have, I\u0027m sure, ladies\u0027 clothes somewhere in the vehicle. Lo and behold, in the back I find a pair of blue jeans, two sizes too big, and a black Mickey Mouse sweatshirt that fits like a wet suit. Luckily, the blood and glass washed out of my hair while I slept beneath Lake Mead. Standing in a dark corner of the parking lot, I change quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find the scientist inside at the dice table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is an attractive man, perhaps forty-five, with thick black hair and large sensual lips. His face is sun dried, tanned and lined, yet on him the effect is not unpleasant. He looks like a man who has weathered many storms and come out ahead. His gray eyes are deep set, very alert, focused. He has discarded his white lab coat for a nicely tailored sports coat. He is holding a pair of red dice as I enter, and it seems to me that he is secretly willing them to obey his commands, as so many other gamblers do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fails to throw a pass, a seven, or an eleven. He loses his bet and the dice pass to another player. I note that he had a hundred-dollar chip on the table, not a small bet for a scientist on the government payroll. I am surprised when he lays down another hundred dollars. He loses that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI observe the man for forty-five minutes. He is a regular--one of the pit bosses calls him Mr. Kane, another, Andy. Andrew Kane, I think. Because Andy continues to lose, at an alarming rate, he is forced to sign a slip to get more chips when the cash in his pockets is gone. But these black honeybees vanish rapidly, and his eagerness turns to frustration. I have been counting. Two thousand dollars gone--just like that. Sighing, he leaves the table and, after a double scotch at the bar, leaves the casino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow him home. The place is modest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes inside and prepares for bed. As the morn?ing sun splashes the eastern sky, he turns out his own light. Obviously he works the night shift. Or else the general had called Andy into work because of Joel. I wonder if he will be working long hours in the days to come. Memorizing his address, I drive back toward the Mirage. If it is Andy\u0027s favorite hangout, it\u0027ll be mine as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no credit cards, money, or identification, but the woman at the reservation desk hands me a key to a luxury suite after staring hard into my beautiful blue eyes. Inside my room, I place a call to my primary business manager in New York City. His voice is unaffected--the government has not gotten to him yet. We do not talk long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Code red,\" I say. \"Have the package delivered to the Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas. Room Two-One-Three-Four. Immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood,\" lie says and hangs up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe package will include everything I need to start a new life: passport, driver\u0027s license, cash, and credit cards. It will arrive at my door in the next hour. There will also be an elaborate makeup kit inside, wigs and different-colored contacts. Over the last fifty centu-ries, I have prepared for every eventuality, including this one. Tomorrow I will look like someone else, and Andrew Kane will meet a mysterious young woman, and fall in love. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-dice-the-last-vampire-3/page-2.html","bookId":2512,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM"}
