{"id":9859,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26.","content":"It was, by far, the hottest day of the year. The mountainstrapped the bone-scorching heat, stifled the city like smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e Power had been out for days. All over Kabul, electric fans satidle, almost mockingly so.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila was lying still on the living-room couch, sweating throughher blouse. Every exhaled breath burned the tip of her nose.\n\u003cbr\u003e She was aware of her parents talking in Mammy\u0027s room. Twonights ago, and again last night, she had awakened andthought she heard their voices downstairs. They were talkingevery day now, ever since the bullet, ever since the new holein the gate.\n\u003cbr\u003e Outside, the far-offboom of artillery, then, more closely, thestammering of a long string of gunfire, followed by another.\n\u003cbr\u003e Inside Laila too a battle was being waged: guilt on one side,partnered with shame, and, on the other, the conviction thatwhat she and Tariq had done was not sinful; that it had beennatural, good, beautiful, even inevitable, spurred by theknowledge that they might never see each other again.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila rolled to her side on the couch now and tried toremember something: At one point, when they were on thefloor, Tariq had lowered his forehead on hers. Then he hadpanted something, eitherAm I hurting you? orIs this hurtingyou?\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila couldn\u0027t decide which he had said.\n\u003cbr\u003e Am Ihurting you?\n\u003cbr\u003e Is this hurting you?\n\u003cbr\u003e Only two weeks since he had left, and it was alreadyhappening- Time, blunting the edges of those sharp memories.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila bore down mentally. What had he said? It seemed vital,suddenly, that she know.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila closed hereyes. Concentrated.\n\u003cbr\u003e With the passing of time, she would slowly tire of this exercise.\n\u003cbr\u003e She would find it increasingly exhausting to conjure up, to dustoff, to resuscitate once again what was long dead. There wouldcome a day, in fact, years later, when Laila would no longerbewail his loss. Or not as relentlessly; not nearly. There wouldcome a day when the details of his face would begin to slipfrom memory\u0027s grip, when overhearing a mother on the streetcall after her child by Tariq\u0027s name would no longer cut heradrift. She would not miss him as she did now, when the acheof his absence was her unremitting companion-like the phantompain of an amputee.\n\u003cbr\u003e Except every once in a long while, when Laila was a grownwoman, ironing a shirt or pushing her children on a swing set,something trivial, maybe the warmth of a carpet beneath herfeet on a hot day or the curve of a stranger\u0027s forehead, wouldset off a memory of that afternoon together. And it would allcome rushing back. The spontaneity of it. Their astonishingimprudence. Their clumsiness. The pain of the act, the pleasureof it, the sadness of it. The heat of their entangled bodies.\n\u003cbr\u003e It would flood her, steal her breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e But then it would pass. The moment would pass. Leave herdeflated, feeling nothing but a vague restlessness.\n\u003cbr\u003e She decided that he had saidAmi hurting you? Yes. Thatwasit. Laila was happy that she\u0027d rememberedThen Babi was in the hallway, calling her name from the topof the stairs, asking her to come up quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s agreed!\"he said, his voice tremulous with suppressedexcitement- \"We\u0027re leaving, Laila. All three of us. We\u0027releavingKabul.\"* * *InMammy\u0027s room, the three of them sat on the bed.Outside,rockets were zipping acrossthe sky as Hekmatyar\u0027s andMassoud\u0027sforces fought and fought. Laila knew that somewherein the city someone had justdied, and that a pall of blacksmoke was hovering over some building that had collapsed in apuffing mass of dust. There would be bodies to step around inthe morning. Some would be collected. Others not. ThenKabul\u0027s dogs, who had developed a taste for human meat,would feast.\n\u003cbr\u003e All the same, Laila had an urge to run through thosestreets.She could barely contain her own happiness. It tookeffortto sit, to not shriek withjoy. Babi said they would go toPakistan first, to apply forvisas. Pakistan, where Tariq was!\n\u003cbr\u003e Tariq was only gone seventeen days, Laila calculated excitedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e If only Mammy had made up her mindseventeen days earlier,they could have left together. She would have been with Tariqright now! But that didn\u0027tmatter now. They were goingtoPeshawar-she,Mammy, and Babi-and they would find Tariq andhis parents there. Surely they would. They would process theirpaperwork together. Then, who knew? Who knew? Europe?\n\u003cbr\u003e America? Maybe, as Babi was always saying, somewhere nearthe sea…Mammy was half lying, half sitting against the headboard. Hereyes were puffy. She was picking at her hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e Three days before, Laila had gone outside for a breath of air.\n\u003cbr\u003e She\u0027d stood by the front gates, leaning against them, whenshe\u0027d heard a loud crack and something had zipped by herright ear, sending tiny splinters of wood flying before her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e After Giti\u0027s death, and the thousands of rounds fired andmyriad rockets that had fallen on Kabul, it was the sight ofthat single round hole in the gate, less than three fingers awayfrom where Laila\u0027s head had been, that shook Mammy awake.\n\u003cbr\u003e Made her see that one war had cost her two children already;this latest could cost her her remaining one.\n\u003cbr\u003e From the walls of the room, Ahmad and Noor smiled down.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila watched Mammy\u0027s eyes bouncing now, guiltily, from onephoto to the other. As if looking for their consent. Theirblessing. As if asking for forgiveness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s nothing left for us here,\" Babi said. \"Our sons aregone, but we still have Laila. We still have each other, Fariba.\n\u003cbr\u003e We can make a new life.\"Babi reached across the bed. When he leaned to take herhands, Mammy let him. On her face, a look of concession. Ofresignation. They held each other\u0027s hands, lightly, and then theywere swaying quietly in an embrace. Mammy buried her facein his neck. She grabbed a handful of his shirt.\n\u003cbr\u003e For hours that night, the excitement robbed Laila of sleep. Shelay in bed and watched the horizon light up in garish shadesof orange and yellow. At some point, though, despite theexhilaration inside and the crack ofartillery fire outside, she fell asleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e And dreamedThey are on a ribbon of beach, sitting on aquilt. It\u0027s a chilly,overcast day,but it\u0027s warm next to Tariq under the blanketdraped over their shoulders. She can see cars parked behind alow fence of chipped white paint beneath a row of windsweptpalm trees. The wind makes her eyes water and buries theirshoes in sand, hurls knots of dead grass from the curvedridgesof one dune to another. They\u0027re watching sailboats bob inthe distance. Around them, seagulls squawk and shiver in thewind. The wind whips up another spray of sand off theshallow, windwardslopes. There is a noise then likea chant, andshe tells him something Babi had taught her years before aboutsinging sand.\n\u003cbr\u003e He rubs at her eyebrow, wipesgrains of sand from it. Shecatches a flicker of the band on his finger. It\u0027s identicalto hers-gold with a sort of maze patternetched all the way around.\n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s true,she tellshim.It\u0027s the friction, of grain against grain.\n\u003cbr\u003e Listen. Hedoes. He frowns. They wait. They hear it again. Agroaning sound, when the wind is soft, when it blows hard, amewling, high-pitched chorus.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * * Babi said theyshould take only what was absolutelynecessary. They would sell the rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That should hold us in Peshawar until I find work.\"For the next two days, they gathered items to be sold. Theyput them in big piles.\n\u003cbr\u003e In her room, Laila set aside old blouses, old shoes, books,toys. Looking under her bed, she found a tiny yellow glass cowHasina had passed to her during recess in fifth grade. Aminiature-soccer-ball key chain, a gift from Giti. A little woodenzebra on wheels. A ceramic astronaut she and Tariq had foundone day in a gutter. She\u0027d been six and he eight. They\u0027d hada minor row, Laila remembered, over which one of them hadfound it.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mammy too gathered her things. There was a reluctance inher movements, and her eyes had a lethargic, faraway look inthem. She did away with her good plates, her napkins, all herjewelry-save for her wedding band-and most of her old clothes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re not selling this, are you?\" Laila said, lifting Mammy\u0027swedding dress. It cascaded open onto her lap. She touched thelace and ribbon along the neckline, the hand-sewn seed pearlson the sleeves.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mammy shrugged and took it from her. She tossed itbrusquely on a pile of clothes. Like ripping off a Band-Aid inone stroke, Laila thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was Babi who had the most painful task.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila found him standing in his study, a rueful expression onhis face as he surveyed his shelves. He was wearing asecondhand T-shirt with a picture of San Francisco\u0027s red bridgeon it. Thick fog rose from the whitecapped waters and engulfedthe bridge\u0027s towers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know the old bit,\" he said. \"You\u0027re on a deserted island.\n\u003cbr\u003e You can have five books. Which do you choose? I neverthought I\u0027d actually have to.\"\"We\u0027ll have to start you a new collection, Babi.\"\"Mm.\" He smiled sadly. \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m leaving Kabul. Iwent to school here, got my first job here, became a father inthis town. It\u0027s strange to think that I\u0027ll be sleeping beneathanother city\u0027s skies soon.\"\"It\u0027s strange for me too.\"\"All day, this poem about Kabul has been bouncing around inmy head. Saib-e-Tabrizi wrote it back in the seventeenthcentury, I think. I used to know the whole poem, but all I canremember now is two lines:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her -walls.\"Laila looked up, saw he was weeping. She put an armaround his waist. \"Oh, Babi. We\u0027ll come back. When this war isover. We\u0027ll come back to Kabul,inshallah. You\u0027ll see.\"* * *On the third morning, Laila began moving the piles of thingsto the yard and depositing them by the front door. They wouldfetch a taxi then and take it all to a pawnshop.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila kept shuffling between the house and the yard, back andforth, carrying stacks of clothes and dishes and box after boxof Babi\u0027s books. She should have been exhausted by noon,when the mound of belongings by the front door had grownwaist high. But, with each trip, she knew that she was thatmuch closer to seeing Tariq again, and, with each trip, her legsbecame more sprightly, her arms more tireless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re going to need a big taxi.\"Laila looked up. It was Mammy calling down from herbedroom upstairs. She was leaning out the window, resting herelbows on the sill. The sun, bright and warm, caught in hergraying hair, shone on her drawn, thin face. Mammy waswearing the same cobalt blue dress she had worn the day ofthe lunch party four months earlier, a youthful dress meant fora young woman, but, for a moment, Mammy looked to Lailalike an old woman. An old woman with stringy arms andsunken temples and slow eyes rimmed by darkened circles ofweariness, an altogether different creature from the plump,round-faced woman beaming radiantly from those grainywedding photos.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Two big taxis,\" Laila said.\n\u003cbr\u003e She could see Babi too, in the living room stacking boxes ofbooks atop each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come up when you\u0027re done with those,\" Mammy said. \"We\u0027llsit down for lunch. Boiled eggs and leftover beans.\"\"My favorite,\" Laila said.\n\u003cbr\u003e She thought suddenly of her dream. She and Tariq on a quilt.\n\u003cbr\u003e The ocean. The wind. The dunes.\n\u003cbr\u003e What had it sounded like, she wondered now, the singingsands?\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila stopped. She saw a gray lizard crawl out of a crack inthe ground. Its head shot side to side. It blinked. Darted undera rock.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila pictured the beach again. Except now the singing was allaround. And growing. Louder and louder by the moment,higher and higher. It flooded her ears. Drowned everything elseout. The gulls were feathered mimes now, opening and closingtheir beaks noiselessly, and the waves were crashing with foamand spray but no roar. The sands sang on. Screaming now. Asound like…a tinkling?\n\u003cbr\u003e Not a tinkling. No. A whistling.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila dropped the books at her feet. She looked up to thesky. Shielded her eyes with one hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then a giant roar.\n\u003cbr\u003e Behind her, a flash of white.\n\u003cbr\u003e The ground lurched beneath her feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e Something hot and powerful slammed into her from behind. Itknocked her out of her sandals. Lifted her up. And now shewas flying, twisting and rotating in the air, seeing sky, thenearth, then sky, then earth. A big burning chunk of woodwhipped by. So did a thousand shards of glass, and it seemedto Laila that she could see each individual one flying all aroundher, flipping slowly end over end, the sunlight catching in each.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tiny, beautiful rainbows.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then Laila struck the wall. Crashed to the ground. On herface and arms, a shower of dirt and pebbles and glass. Thelast thing she was aware of was seeing something thud to theground nearby. A bloody chunk of something. On it, the tip ofa red bridge poking through thick fog.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *Shapes moving about. A fluorescent light shines from theceiling above. A woman\u0027s face appears, hovers over hers.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila fades back to the dark.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *Another face. This time a man\u0027s. His features seem broad anddroopy. His lips move but make no sound. All Laila hears isringing.\n\u003cbr\u003e The man waves his hand at her. Frowns. His lips move again.\n\u003cbr\u003e It hurts. It hurts to breathe. It hurts everywhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e A glass of water. A pink pill.\n\u003cbr\u003e Back to the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *The woman again. Long face, narrow-set eyes. She sayssomething. Laila can\u0027t hear anything but the ringing. But shecan see the words, like thick black syrup, spilling out of thewoman\u0027s mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her chest hurts. Her arms and legs hurt.\n\u003cbr\u003e All around, shapes moving.\n\u003cbr\u003e Where is Tariq?\n\u003cbr\u003e Why isn\u0027t he here?\n\u003cbr\u003e Darkness. A flock of stars.\n\u003cbr\u003e Babi and she, perched somewhere high up. He is pointing toa field of barley. A generator comes to life.\n\u003cbr\u003e The long-faced woman is standing over her looking down.\n\u003cbr\u003e It hurts to breathe.\n\u003cbr\u003e Somewhere, an accordion playing.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mercifully, the pink pill again. Then a deep hush. A deephushfalls over everything.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53245.html","bookId":1002,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:24 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:24 AM"}
