The ink blurred on the cards. Siobhan\u0027s chunky sunflower head defied the pelting drops, but Mary\u0027s lilies and freesias crumpled, then fell apart. The chrysanthemum oar darkened as it decayed. Rain swelled the river, made streams in the gutters and turned the steep roads into Pagford glossy and treacherous. The windows of the school bus were opaque with condensation; the hanging baskets in the Square became bedraggled, and Samantha Mollison, windscreen wipers on full tilt, suffered a minor collision in the car on the way home from work in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA copy of the Yarvil and District Gazette stuck out of Mrs Catherine Weedon\u0027s door in Hope Street for three days, until it became sodden and illegible. Finally, social worker Kay Bawden tugged it out of the letterbox, peered in through the rusty flap and spotted the old lady spread-eagled at the foot of the stairs. A policeman helped break down the front door, and Mrs Weedon was taken away in an ambulance to South West General.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill the rain fell, forcing the sign-painter who had been hired to rename the old shoe shop to postpone the job. It poured for days and into the nights, and the Square was full of hunchbacks in waterproofs, and umbrellas collided on the narrow pavements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Mollison found the gentle patter against the dark window soothing. He sat in the study that had once been his daughter Patricia\u0027s bedroom, and contemplated the email that he had received from the local newspaper. They had decided to run Councillor Fairbrother\u0027s article arguing that the Fields ought to remain with Pagford, but in the interests of balance, they hoped that another councillor might make the case for reassignment in the following issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackfired on you, hasn\u0027t it, Fairbrother? thought Howard happily. There you were, thinking you\u0027d have it all your own way ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the email and turned instead to the small pile of papers beside him. These were the letters that had come trickling in, requesting an election to fill Barry\u0027s vacant seat. The constitution stated that it required nine applications to enforce a public vote, and he had received ten. He read them over, while his wife\u0027s and his business partner\u0027s voices rose and fell in the kitchen, stripping bare between them the meaty scandal of old Mrs Weedon\u0027s collapse and belated discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027... don\u0027t walk out on your doctor for nothing, do you? Screaming at the top of her voice, Karen said - \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 - saying she\u0027d been given the wrong drugs, yes, I know,\u0027 said Shirley, who considered that she had a monopoly on medical speculation, given that she was a hospital volunteer. \u0027They\u0027ll run tests up at the General, I expect.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027d be feeling very worried if I were Dr Jawanda.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She\u0027s probably hoping the Weedons are too ignorant to sue, but that won\u0027t matter if the General finds out it was the wrong medication.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She\u0027ll be struck off,\u0027 said Maureen with relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Shirley, \u0027and I\u0027m afraid a lot of people will feel good riddance. Good riddance.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethodically Howard sorted letters into piles. Miles\u0027 completed application forms he set aside on their own. The remaining communications were from fellow Parish Councillors. There were no surprises here; as soon as Parminder had emailed him to tell him that she knew of somebody who was interested in standing for Barry\u0027s seat, he had expected these six to rally round her, demanding an election. Together with Bends-Your-Ear herself, they were the ones he dubbed \u0027the Obstreperous Faction\u0027, whose leader had recently fallen. Onto this pile he placed the completed forms of Colin Wall, their chosen candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto a third pile he placed four more letters, which were, likewise, from expected sources: professional complainers of Pagford, known to Howard as perennially dissatisfied and suspicious, all prolific correspondents to the Yarvil and District Gazette. Each had their own obsessive interest in some esoteric local issue, and considered themselves \u0027independent minded\u0027; they would be the ones most likely to scream \u0027nepotism\u0027 if Miles had been co-opted; but they were among the most anti-Fields people in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward took the last two letters in each hand, weighing them up. One of them was from a woman whom he had never met, who claimed (Howard took nothing for granted) to work at the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic (the fact that she styled herself \u0027Ms\u0027 inclined him to believe her). After some hesitation, he placed this on top of Cubby Wall\u0027s application forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last letter, unsigned and typed on a word processor, demanded an election in intemperate terms. It had an air of haste and carelessness and was littered with typos. The letter extolled the virtues of Barry Fairbrother and named Miles specifically as \u0027unfit to fill his sheos\u0027. Howard wondered whether Miles had a disgruntled client out there who might prove to be an embarrassment. It was good to be forewarned of such potential hazards. However, Howard doubted whether the letter, being anonymous, counted as a vote for an election. He therefore fed it into the little desktop shredder that Shirley had given him for Christmas. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-8.html","bookId":2230,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:31 PM"}
