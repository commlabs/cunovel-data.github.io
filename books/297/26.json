Peter’s plan in fighting was to pitch in heavily, and as he generally tackled those who knew no more than himself of the “noble art of self-defence,” and was careful to fight only with those whom he knew to be smaller and weaker than himself, he had achieved a long list of victories.

Peter did not dare to make a fuss, knowing that Mr. Barclay had the physical strength to enforce his decision. But with Walter he believed it to be different. He therefore proposed to make a transfer, that he might no longer be humiliated by being associated with those smaller and younger than himself.
