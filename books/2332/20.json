Then she said, \"You and Lisa were close, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, do me a favor, okay? Tell me to shut up and mind my own business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to tell you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask your question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she the one you were sleeping with? God, I can\u0027t believe I said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The answer\u0027s yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the answer\u0027s yes. It ended awhile ago, didn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite a while ago. I hadn\u0027t seen her since before the two of us saw her at Armstrong\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought. I knew you were seeing somebody. That\u0027s what I meant when I said…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That marriage didn\u0027t have to change anything. And I meant it. Did you think I was being noble? Because I wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured you meant it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I did, and I was not for one minute being noble. I was being realistic. Men and women are different, and one of the ways they\u0027re different is sex. They can throw me out of the Sisterhood for saying so, but I don\u0027t care. It\u0027s true. And I ought to know, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men screw around, and for years I made a very nice living being somebody they screwed around with. And most of them were married, and none of it had anything to do with their marriages. They screwed around for a lot of reasons, but all of them added up to one reason: Men are like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up my hand, turned my wedding ring around and around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I think it\u0027s probably biological. Other animals are the same way, and don\u0027t tell me they\u0027re all neurotic or responding to peer pressure. So why should I expect you to be different, or why should I even want you to be different? The only thing to worry about is if you found somebody else you liked better than me, and I didn\u0027t think that would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It never will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I decided, because I know what we\u0027ve got. Did you fall in love with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was never a threat, was it? To us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve got tears in my eyes. Can you believe it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can believe it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wife crying over the death of the mistress. You\u0027d think they\u0027d be tears of joy, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And \u0027mistress\u0027 is the wrong word for her. You\u0027d have to be paying her rent, and seeing her every afternoon from five to seven. Isn\u0027t that how the French manage these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re asking the wrong person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cinq а sept, that\u0027s what they call it. What\u0027ll we call her? How about the Designated Girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just feel so sad. Oh, yes, hold me. That\u0027s better. You know how I feel, baby? Like we lost a member of the family. Isn\u0027t that ridiculous? Isn\u0027t that nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first calls I returned was from Ray Gruliow. \"I need your professional services,\" he said, \"and for a change I\u0027ve got a client with reasonably deep pockets, which means you can bill at your full hourly rate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose he can wait a couple of weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t even want to wait a couple days on this one. Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re booked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I just told another member of your profession. I\u0027ll be a little more candid with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In light of our warm personal and professional relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the idea. I\u0027ve got some personal business, Ray, and I can\u0027t even think about work for the time being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Personal business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some would call that oxymoronic, don\u0027t you think? If it\u0027s personal, how can it be business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute. This wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with something that happened last night in your part of town, would it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see the headline in the Post? \u0027Slaughter on Tenth Avenue,\u0027 they called it, with the originality for which they\u0027re famous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen the papers yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or the TV?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" he said. \"Very interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent for a moment. Then I said, \"I think I need legal advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, young man, today\u0027s your lucky day. I just happen to be an attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was there last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we talking about Tenth Avenue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you were there when the excrement hit the ventilating system?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ. You know the body count? The last I heard it stood at twelve dead and seven wounded, and at least one of the wounded is circling the drain. One of the morning news shows had an interior shot of the bar, and it looked a lot like Rotterdam after the Luftwaffe paid a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked pretty bad when I saw it last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you got out before the cops turned up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"Earlier in the evening I had dinner with a friend at a Chinese restaurant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in Beijing I understand everybody\u0027s favorite place is McDonald\u0027s. Go figure, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it didn\u0027t make the news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guess what didn\u0027t make the- This is a restaurant in the same neighborhood as the other place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less. Eighth Avenue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It made the news, all right, probably because it was in the same neighborhood. Lone gunman shoots a lone diner for no reason at all. He ran a copy shop in the neighborhood, if I remember correctly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, a printshop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close enough. So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You met the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard him qualify six months ago at St. Luke\u0027s,\" I said. \"He had seventeen years. Jim F.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sponsor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the guy you have dinner with every Sunday. They said he was a lone diner, but I guess he wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was alone when it happened. I was washing my hands. Ray, the two things are related and I\u0027m the link. I held out on the cops last night, and then I got the hell out of Grogan\u0027s before they arrived on the scene. They\u0027ve been leaving messages on my machine and I don\u0027t want to talk to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So don\u0027t talk to them. You\u0027re under no obligation to do so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a licensed private investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s a point. That does obligate you in certain ways, doesn\u0027t it? On the other hand, if you\u0027re working for an attorney, you\u0027re shielded to a degree by lawyer-client privilege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to hire me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this time around I\u0027m going to be your lawyer. Is your friend still ably represented by the resourceful Mark Rosenstein?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have him call Mark,\" he said, \"and have him tell Mark to hire you to investigate various matters in connection with pending legal action. Can you remember all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m writing it down. The only thing is, my guy could be hard to reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call Mark. It\u0027s not as though he has to do anything. Meanwhile, you might want to read the papers and look at the television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I\u0027ll have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New York One profiled your friend in the course of a stand-up in front of what\u0027s left of his place of business. They made him sound like Al Capone out of Damon Runyon. Bloodthirsty but somehow engaging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That great piece of theater with the bowling ball. Did that really happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t there,\" I said. \"And you never get a straight answer from him on the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it didn\u0027t happen,\" he said, \"it damn well should have. Remember, don\u0027t tell them a thing. And call me if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called TJ, and he picked up the papers and brought them over. We sat in front of the TV and he channel-surfed while I saw what the tabloids had to say. They both gave it the front page- the News just slugged it hell\u0027s kitchen- but it had broken too late to get the full treatment inside, and must have missed the early editions altogether. The columnists and feature writers would be all over it tomorrow morning, but for now there were just the bare facts. The body count varied, the Post had one more dead than the News, and names were withheld pending notification of kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe TV reporters didn\u0027t have a whole lot more hard news, aside from more recent numbers for the casualties. But they had names and photos of some of the dead. Some of the photos looked familiar, but otherwise none were of people I knew. They evidently hadn\u0027t identified Lisa or her friend yet, or hadn\u0027t managed to notify family members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior shots of Grogan\u0027s were as described, and as I remembered the place when Mick was dragging me out of it. And the exteriors were what you\u0027d expect, with one reporter after another doing a stand-up in front of the sweet old saloon, its windows swathed in sheets of plywood now, the sidewalk in front still carpeted with debris and broken glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV\u0027s edge was in sidebars and backgrounders, in interviews with survivors and neighborhood residents, in profiles of Michael \"The Butcher\" Ballou, Grogan\u0027s legendary unofficial proprietor, and heir to a long-standing tradition of savage Hell\u0027s Kitchen barkeeps. They trotted out the old stories, some truer than others, and of course they didn\u0027t fail to include the one about the bowling ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That happen?\" TJ wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to all versions of the tale, Mick Ballou had had a serious difference of opinion with another neighborhood character named Paddy Farrelly, who disappeared one day and was never seen again. The day after Farrelly was last sighted, Mick allegedly made the rounds of the neighborhood ginmills (including Grogan\u0027s, no doubt, which had not yet come into his hands) carrying the sort of bag in which a bowler carries his ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he did in the various saloons, aside from having a glass of whiskey, depended on which version of the story you were hearing. In some he simply made a show of setting the bag significantly on top of the bar, then asking after the absent Farrelly and drinking his health \"wherever the dear lad may be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other renditions he opened the bag, offering a look within to those who wanted it. And in one over-the-top version he went door to door, saloon to saloon, each time yanking the severed head of Paddy Farrelly out by the hair and showing it around. \"Doesn\u0027t he look grand?\" he said. \"When did he ever look so fine?\" And then he invited people to buy old Paddy a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what happened,\" I told TJ. \"I was over in Brooklyn, still in uniform, and I\u0027d never heard of Paddy Farrelly or of Mick, either. If I had to guess, I\u0027d say he did make the rounds and he did have a bowling bag with him, but I don\u0027t believe he opened it. He might have, if he was wild and drunk enough, but I don\u0027t think he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if he had? Where I\u0027m goin\u0027, what you figure was in the bag?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have had the head in there,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t doubt for a minute that he killed Farrelly. I understand they really hated each other, and if he got the chance he probably killed him with a cleaver, and wore his father\u0027s apron while he did it. He might well have dismembered the body for disposal, and that would have involved cutting the head off, so yes, he could very well have had the head in the bag.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-20.html","bookId":2332,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM"}
