Christ, Navarre, I thought I was repaying some favours. You look like I just stabbed you in the back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Prine started singing about flag decals on Mr. Quarles\u0027 computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez looked out into the parking lot, where a maroon LeBaron was just pulling in. A large militarytype AfricanAmerican man in a coat and tie was getting out of the LeBaron, glowering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Mr. Navarre,\" Lopez told me. \"Thanks for your time, Quarles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway, Lopez said, \"There\u0027s a back way through the CODIS office.

You know this is wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were burning. \"I know what ninety percent means, Tres. I know what it\u0027ll mean to my sergeant, who\u0027s about to walk through that door. And Tres—the bad things I said about Miss Lee? Forget them. Your brother is going to need all the help he can get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt sunset, the top windows of Ruby McBride\u0027s dream house glowed orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the yachts were out enjoying an evening cruise. The restaurant was nearly empty. The boat jockeys had little to do except smoke cigarettes, recline on their massive forklift, play cards at the lakefront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in my truck, idling at the bottom of Ruby\u0027s private driveway, trying to decide if I really had enough courage to face another human being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d spent the afternoon at Jimmy\u0027s dome, hiding from reporters\u0027 phone calls, hiding from the news reports, finishing Jimmy\u0027s kiln at the waterfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of me, because of one brass casing, the investigation had gained lethal momentum. At 2:00 P.M., my brother had been formally charged with murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should\u0027ve called our sister, Shelley, in Wisconsin, broken her long, selfimposed exile from the family to give her the news. I should\u0027ve called my mom in Colorado, ruined her vacation. As of yet, I hadn\u0027t done either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of Ruby McBride\u0027s driveway, her blue Miata glistened—noseout, ready for action. Up on Ruby\u0027s deck, I saw a flicker of red hair go past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the F150 into gear, rumbled up the drive, and skidded to a diagonal stop, blocking the Mazda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of the truck, walked up the stairs. I heard two voices before I got to the top—Clyde Simms mumbling something, Ruby answering, \"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde sat on the railing bench, looking about as happy as a fourthstring quarterback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby stood by the hot tub, running water over her hands with a garden hose. She\u0027d been crying. Her hair hung in a stiff red mesh around her shoulders. She was barefoot, and an apron covered her Tshirt and shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see why she wanted to wash off. Her apron and her hands were stained with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you, Tres,\" she said. \"Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed at the streaks of red on her apron. \"What the hell—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped the hose, grabbed a bucket of pink water on the edge of the hot tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We blew it,\" she told me. \"We really blew it, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big yellow sponge sloshed angrily around the bucket as she stormed off toward the kitchen area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde stared at me. \"She\u0027s right, you know. You and that fucking brass casing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week\u0027s worth of anger surged inside me. I followed Ruby, yelling at her back, \"I didn\u0027t sell out my own friends, Ruby. I didn\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I stepped inside and saw the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the room hadn\u0027t changed since I\u0027d been here Sunday night. It was still a bare box of walls and windows, the floor littered with odd bits of lumber and power tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe far wall, however, looked like a Jackson Pollock painting. The sheetrock was marred with swathes of dark, sticky redbrown—crusty and thick and splattered. It smelled like a rending plant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby dropped her bucket, tried to wring pink water out of the sponge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did it happen?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored me, tried to scrub the blood off the wall. She only managed to turn more of the sheetrock pink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde came up behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wee hours,\" he said. \"Workers didn\u0027t go to the upper level all day. They were doing wiring on the bottom floor. Ruby always goes up to the deck when she gets home in the afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody knew the workers\u0027 schedule,\" I said. \"They wanted Ruby to be the one to find this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby kept working—rubbing at the stains, cursing, splattering herself with pink water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found the deer about fifty yards downhill,\" Clyde told me, \"gutted with a sharp knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Dobe Miata ain\u0027t good for much, but she\u0027s got a decent nose. Bastard who did this carried a bucket of blood all the way here. He spilled some on the steps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you call the police?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police,\" Ruby spat. She crushed the sponge in her fists, lines of red leaking down her forearms. \"Tres, the police are fitting your brother\u0027s neck for a noose. They\u0027d explain how he did this, probably lugged his wheelchair all the way up the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked the sheetrock, then kept swiping at the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not doing anything.\" Clyde said it gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My—goddamn—house.\" Every word was more elbow grease with the sponge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruby,\" Clyde said. \"I told you I\u0027d deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flung the sponge in the bucket. \"You will not deal with anything, Clyde. GET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOUT.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my eyes on Ruby. I didn\u0027t so much see Clyde leave as I felt it—his gravity suddenly missing from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did this?\" I asked Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her hands on her apron. Her fingernails were scarlet crescents. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you don\u0027t. You don\u0027t know how Matthew Pena got inside Techsan\u0027s program. You don\u0027t know how Jimmy got shot. You don\u0027t know what that damn bullet casing was doing in the lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’ closed the distance between us in two steps, then slapped me across the face. I didn\u0027t try to stop her. The sting was the first real sensation I\u0027d had all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom somewhere out on the deck, Clyde called Ruby\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t an offer of help. More a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby stared back at her splattered wall, then at all the other places she\u0027d managed to smear pink—the floor, the doorframe, the new kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my house,\" she murmured. \"No one can do this to my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes. Her lips were trembling. \"I\u0027m all right. I just have to take care of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to cup my hand around her elbow, but she yanked away, wrestled off her apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe washed her hands again, gathered up her shoes and purse, held them against her stomach like a melting football.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruby—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed past me. \"I\u0027ll fix it. Goddamn if I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde stood motionless at the railing, letting Ruby go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got to the drive and found my car blocking hers, she headed down the hill, cursing as she stumbled barefoot over sharp pieces of broken limestone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed about fifteen steps behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruby,\" I called. \"GO—AWAY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d made it to the marina parking lot now, started limping toward the docks. She dropped one of her shoes but kept walking— one parking space, two parking spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you can stop him, Ruby? You think he\u0027ll allow that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree parking spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me Pena understood people,\" I called after her. \"I guess you\u0027re right. He\u0027s sure got your number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearest boat jockeys had stood now, their poker game forgotten. One of them called, \"Ms. McBride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up her Adidas, brought it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one has my number, Tres,\" she told me. \"No one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pena wouldn\u0027t do something randomly. He\u0027d pry into your past, look for weaknesses, pick something he knew would rattle you. Why deer blood, Ruby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t—\" She choked, forced a shaky inhale. \"No one destroys my property. That wasn\u0027t ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of the deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched the shoe, hobbled over to the nearest car, slid down against the bumper, and started fumbling with her laces. \"I can make things right, Tres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I\u0027m going to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same thing Garrett had told me five days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was blood between two of Ruby\u0027s toes—her own blood now—but she didn\u0027t seem to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the boat jockeys called, \"Ms. McBride? You sure—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me alone!\" She tugged on a shoe, started picking at the laces of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t confront Pena,\" I told her. \"Not by yourself. Don\u0027t be stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not confronting Pena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer purse lay in the gravel. The black butt of a gun—probably the one I\u0027d seen on her boat the day before—peeked out the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can fix this,\" she told me again. \"But I have to do it. Carefully. You can\u0027t help me, Tres. Neither can Clyde. I\u0027m not asking you to understand—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, looked out toward the water. \"Maybe I am asking you to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy is dead. Garrett doesn\u0027t have a clue what\u0027s really going on. I can fix this. But that can\u0027t happen if I don\u0027t go out tonight—by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby got her other shoe on, stood up. The setting sun turned her shadow into stilt person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could follow me, Tres. You could seriously screw this up. But I\u0027m asking you—if it were the other way around, would you want me to stop you? Would you like it if I barged in, assumed I had the right to tell you what was safe, what you needed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat jockeys had gone back to their game and their cigarettes. Clyde hadn\u0027t moved from the top of the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to make amends,\" Ruby said. \"I was serious about that, Tres.

Yes. Now let me stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shouldered her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to be part of the sunset—her entire form glowing red. I felt like I could touch her, and I would disappear into the glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a long, relieved exhale, came up and kissed me roughly on the cheek, exactly where she had slapped me. \"I\u0027ll make it all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and walked toward the docks—toward the Ruby, Too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her until she got to the pier, then I headed back up the drive, toward the tower where Clyde was still playing gargoyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t say he was exactly waiting for me at the top of the stairs, but he was there—leaning against the redwood railing, looking over the tops of the live oaks toward Mansfield Dam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby\u0027s hot tub cover had been peeled off.
