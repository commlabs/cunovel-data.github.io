Their bodies were withered dry, their cultivation bases vanished. Now, they felt an intense pain enveloping them like floodwaters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything went black in their eyes, and the world disappeared. Their lives… were no more!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous wailing, struggling souls emerged from their eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Each and every cultivator’s back was arched, their face sunken, and their eyes gray. Their mouths were stuck open stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir souls emerged and then fused into the vortex, becoming a cyclone of souls. Anyone who could see the spectacle was flabbergasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demonic magic! That’s Demonic magic!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such a sinister divine ability has got to be Demon magic!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Northern Reaches cultivators in the area were trembling, and their hearts were filled with terror. Horrified, they watched as the souls spun into a cyclone, and Meng Hao gestured toward the ground, then looked up. His white hair floated around him, and his eyes glowed with a cold ruthlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was also as pale as death, making his overall appearance like that of a Devilish god. The souls of the slain around him looked like slaves that were incapable of escaping him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp in the sky, the old man who was in roc form gasped, completely shaken by what he was seeing. However, killing intent flickered in his eyes, and ferociousness burned in his heart. He continued to dive directly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your occult trickery won’t work on me! DIE!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered, and as the old man bore down on him, he suddenly blasted up from the ground. The cyclone of countless struggling souls surrounded him, looking almost like a river as he sped to meet the roc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom echoed out and even as strong and stalwart as he was, the old man couldn’t stop the blood from oozing out of the corners of his mouth. He could no longer maintain the form of a roc, and reverted to his human form as he tumbled backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed from Meng Hao’s mouth, and the ground beneath him cracked and split, radiating in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe struggling souls exploded, transforming into motes of soul light that then sped toward Meng Hao and fused into his body. Meng Hao could sense that he had reached… the threshold of the Blood Demon Grand Magic’s fifth level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need even more souls!” he thought, his eyes flickering. Not waiting for the old man to charge him again, he produced the Lightning Cauldron. There was a flicker, and he switched places with another Northern Reaches cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appeared once again in the middle of the Northern Reaches’ army, whereupon he immediately gestured toward the ground. A vortex appeared as the Blood Demon Grand Magic once again surged into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost seemed as if, to Meng Hao, the Northern Reaches cultivators were merely food. They were essential to his ability to combat a peak Dao Seeking expert. As he absorbed them, miserable screams filled the air. Qi, blood, and cultivation bases were sucked away, used by Meng Hao to strengthen his fleshly body to the point where it burst from the mid Dao Seeking stage into late Dao Seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for his cultivation base, it now exceeded Spirit Severing and had temporarily entered into Dao Seeking! Natural law swirled around him, making Meng Hao… even more valiant!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Demon Grand Magic was most suited to fighting against multiple opponents!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more enemies there were, the more invincible one could become!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp in midair, the old man in animal hide clothing roared. His body flashed as he transformed, not into a roc, but into a gigantic black python. He opened his vicious mouth and struck toward Meng Hao as if to swallow him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao waited in the vortex as the python closed in. Thousands of Northern Reaches cultivators could be heard screaming as their bodies withered, their cultivation bases faded, and they neared death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Meng Hao said ‘soul,’ and a rumbling could be heard as the thousands of cultivators exploded, and their souls flew out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Meng Hao vanished. Even as the python was about to reach him, he was off in the distance, where another Blood Demon Grand Magic vortex sprang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man was completely infuriated, and yet there was nothing he could do to stop Meng Hao and the Lightning Cauldron. The agile teleportation-like ability made it incredibly difficult to pin Meng Hao down, and left him shocked in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! Meng Hao, I dare you to fight me one on one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling intent flickered in the old man’s eyes. This time, he didn’t pursue Meng Hao, but instead flew toward the Southern Domain’s army of cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you won’t come out and fight, then I’ll just start killing some Southern Domain cultivators!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stopped in place, then waved his right hand. The Blood Demon Grand Magic appeared, and the Lightning Cauldron flickered. This time, he changed positions with the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the exchange took place, the old man… was shocked to find himself directly in the middle of one of Meng Hao’s vortexes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao hovered in midair, looking coldly at the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna fight?” he said. “Let’s fight, then!” He stretched his arms out to either side, and the multiple vortexes he had created moments ago echoed with the shocked screams of Northern Reaches cultivators. Qi and blood flowed toward him, causing Meng Hao’s body to once again reach the peak of Dao Seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled the air as the old man’s body began to wither. However, he was able to struggle his way out, whereupon he aimed a punch at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao clenched his fists and shot forward to meet him. The two of them flashed back and forth over a hundred times, causing booms to rattle everything in the area. Finally, the old man’s eyes flashed with a bright light. Suddenly, two golden birds flew out from within his pupils, emitting shrill cries as they shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the old man began to spin rapidly like a top. He lifted his right leg high into the air and then slammed it down toward Meng Hao’s head. If the kick connected, Meng Hao would obviously suffer a serious injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered coldly as he said. “Spirit Meridians!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, more miserable shrieks could be heard coming from the Northern Reaches cultivators stuck in the vortexes down below. Their cultivation bases were sucked away through their noses and mouths to shoot directly toward Meng Hao. Cultivation bases swirled around Meng Hao in the form of a tempest, bolstering his own cultivation base until it was as strong as the peak of Dao Seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly performed an incantation gesture and pointed towards the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ninth Mountain! CRUSH!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled the air as the majestic Ninth Mountain appeared up above. It was huge, almost like a real mountain, and the natural law that swirled around it stirred the sky and caused the land to shake. Massive pressure crushed down on the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man lifted his head up and roared. His body expanded rapidly as he turned into a mountain-like giant. He immediately raised both hands into the air and grabbed onto the Ninth Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as the Ninth Mountain slammed into him. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and cracking sounds could be heard as he managed to resist it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soul!” said Meng Hao, his eyes radiating coldness. As the Northern Reaches cultivators in the vortexes toppled over dead, struggling souls flew toward Meng Hao from their eyes, ears, noses and mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast quantities of souls that were merging into Meng Hao’s body caused a rumbling sound to fill his head. All of a sudden… he reached the fifth level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, Meng Hao’s cultivation base did not change. However, his battle prowess instantly grew several times over!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair whipped about, and he looked every bit like a Devilish divinity. His eyes shone like suns, and the entire battlefield down below was obscured by the shadow of the black mist that surged around him. It was as if he was blotting out the entire Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath and then advanced forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man let out an enraged roar as he shoved upward with his arms. Apparently, he was causing some form of natural law to spring into motion. Now, cracking sounds could be heard coming from the Ninth Mountain, and then it shattered into countless pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little bastard!” said the old man, blood oozing out of the corners of his mouth. Collapsing the Ninth Mountain had taken quite a bit of effort on his part. Now, his body flickered as he transformed into a white tiger, which roared and pounced toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Meng Hao didn’t evade. The two cultivators met in midair; booms echoed out as they fought back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Qi and Blood!” said Meng Hao coolly. This time, a tiny vortex appeared in the palm of his hand. When he landed a blow on the front leg of the old man’s tiger form, the entire leg instantly turned into skin and bones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden, shocking turn of events caused the old man’s face to fall. He gasped, a tremor ran through his white tiger form, and he retreated at top speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered with killing intent. How could he possibly allow the old man to flee as simply as that? His body flashed through the air, and he appeared right next to the old man. The vortex in the palm of his right hand shot toward the old man’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“SCREW OFF!!” roared the old man. Immediately, his cultivation base surged with an explosion of qi that shot outward. Meng Hao gave a cold snort and continued on with his palm strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spirit Meridians!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as he absorbed, not qi and blood, but cultivation base. As the terrifying cultivation base explosion emanating from the old man reached Meng Hao, Meng Hao simply touched it with his hand, and it appeared to collapse. Boundless cultivation base power immediately began to fuse into Meng Hao’s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man’s scalp went numb. He could never have imagined that Meng Hao’s magical technique could be so shocking. In two short moments of contact, he had lost ten percent of his cultivation base as well as his qi and blood. It was nothing short of terrifying to the man, and he immediately fell back in retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao pursued without any hesitation. They fought back and forth, and the old men let out continuous roars. He didn’t dare to get too close but could only flee at top speed under an unending bombardment from Meng Hao. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and he fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face was cold, and his killing intent raged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnlookers could hardly believe what they were seeing. The old man in animal hide clothing was incapable of fighting back against Meng Hao, and was being beaten to the point that he was forced to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Save me!!” he cried, his mind trembling. His body was quickly becoming nothing more than skin and bones, and he had lost forty percent of the power of his cultivation base. He knew that he was in a moment of grave crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Northern Reaches cultivators were astonished, and the other five Northern Reaches peak Dao Seeking experts up above were shaken. Moments ago, when Meng Hao had slain the red-robed boy, they were shocked. However, in their minds, Meng Hao had simply used some sort of trickery to win. But seeing what he was doing now left them thoroughly rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when they were about to make a move to help the old man, the ‘withering’ character flickered into being next to Meng Hao. Gray light radiated out, and all of the peak Dao Seeking experts halted in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t dare to get close to him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was exactly why Meng Hao hadn’t used the ‘withering’ character again. The magical symbol’s greatest use to him right now… was as a threat against any outside interference!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 776: Fifth Level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-775\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-777\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-776","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
