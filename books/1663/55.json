Things wouldn’t ever be mundane. I wasn’t fully human anymore. My boyfriend—the guy I loved—was an alien. And there may become a point where, like Dawson and Blake, Daemon and I would have to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was going to be a tomorrow, a next week, month, summer, and fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only you would be out gardening right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whipped around at the sound of Blake’s voice. He leaned against my car, dressed in all black, ready for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time since our confrontation that Blake had come around me while I was alone, and the alien part of me responded. That roller-coaster feeling was swelling inside me. Static pricked along my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my ground. “What do you want, Blake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly as his gaze fell to the ground. “We’re leaving soon, right? I’m just a little early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was just a little bit of a book nerd. Yeah, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrushing the dirt off my fingers, I watched him wryly. “How did you get here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parked at the end of the road at the empty house.” He gestured with his chin. “The last time I parked here, I’m pretty sure someone melted the paint on the hood of my truck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounded like Dee and her microwave hands. I crossed my arms. “Dee and Andrew are next door,” I felt the need to point out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He pulled a hand out, ran it through his spikey hair. “You looked really good at prom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnease unfurled in my belly. “Yeah, I saw you. Did you come alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “I was there only for a few minutes. Never did the high school dance thing. Kind of disappointing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake dropped his hand. “You worried about tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who wouldn’t be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Smart girl,” he said, and smiled a little. It was more of a grimace than anything. “No one that I know of has infiltrated one of their facilities before or even gotten as far as we did last time. No Luxen or hybrid, and we can’t be the first to attempt it. I bet there’re a dozen Dawsons and Beths, Blakes and Chrises.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuscles tightened in my neck and shoulders. “If this is supposed to be a pep talk, you completely fail at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t mean it that way. Just that if we do this, we’re the strongest, you know. The best out of their hybrids and out of the Luxen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny or maybe just ironic, I thought, that what Daedalus wanted so badly was the only ones who could go up against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached into my pocket, feeling the warm, smooth edges of the opal. “Then we’re just awesome, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pained smile and then Blake said, “That’s what I’m counting on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all dressed like a ragtag group of reject ninjas. My skin sweated under the long-sleeved black thermal. The idea was that the less skin exposed, the less the onyx impacted us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn’t really pan out that way last time, but we weren’t taking any chances tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opal was burning a hole in my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving to the mountains of Virginia was a quiet affair. This time around, even Blake was silent. Dawson was a ball of energy beside him. Once, luckily not when cars surrounded us, he slipped into his true form, nearly blinding all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake’s words lingered in my head. That’s what I’m counting on. I was probably being paranoid, but they settled like sour milk. Of course he was counting on us to pull off the near impossible. He had just as much as us to gain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I thought of Luc’s warning: never trust those who have anything to gain or lose. But that meant we couldn’t trust either him or our friends. All of us had something to gain or lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon reached over the center console and squeezed my fidgeting hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking these things right then wasn’t the best route to travel. I was getting myself all worked up and spazzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at Daemon and decided to focus on our afternoon. We didn’t really do anything. Just cuddled together, both of us wide awake, and somehow that was more intimate than anything else. Last night or early this morning had been a different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was a creative fellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks were stained red the rest of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two SUVs arrived at the little farm at the bottom of the pitch-black access road with five minutes to spare. As we climbed out, Blake got his confirmation text from Luc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were a go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of limbering up, we all stayed still, conserving our energy. Ash, Andrew, and Dee remained in their SUV. The rest of us moved to the edge of the overgrown field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped I didn’t get infested with ticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one last look at the Luxen in the vehicle, it was time to go. Letting the Source flow through my blood and bones and ripple over my skin, we took off into the darkness, without the light of the moon on the cloudy night. Like last time, Daemon stayed beside me. The last thing anyone needed was my tripping over something and rolling back down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were quiet and tense when we reached the edge of the woods, waited to see that only one guard manned the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Daemon who took him out this time. Then we were at the fence, keying in the first code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking off across the stretch of field, the five of us moved like ghosts. Visible in one’s peripheral vision, but gone when looked at head-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the set of three doors, Dawson entered in the second password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLabyrinth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now it was do or die time. All these months had led up to this. Did our onyx training mean a damn thing? Daemon glanced at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped my hand into my pocket, wrapping my fingers around the opal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing through the onyx spray would still hurt like the fiery bowels of hell for the others, but it should be manageable if Blake had been right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slid open with an airlock sound and Daemon was the first through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir puffed and he flinched, but one leg moved in front of the other and then he was through, on the other side. He stopped, glancing over his shoulder, and smiled that half smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of us let out a collective breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe filed through the onyx-shielded door. Each of the guys took the spray with a wince and grimace of pain. I barely felt a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside Mount Weather for the first time, we fell behind Blake, who knew most of the way. The tunnel was shadowed, with small lamps placed every twenty feet or so on the orange walls. I searched for those murderous emergency doors but it was too dark to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTipping my head up, I noticed something terrifying about the ceiling. It was shiny—like it was wet or something, but it wasn’t liquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Onyx,” Blake whispered. “The whole place is covered in onyx.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless they did a massive remodel recently, that couldn’t be something new to Blake. Feeling the opal against my skin, I pulled on the Source and waited for the extreme rush of energy as we flew down the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tiny spark of extra energy, but nothing like it had been when Daemon and I had tested it out. My heart sunk as we neared the end of the long tunnel. It had to be all the onyx, somehow weakening the opal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the tunnel, it split into a crossroad. Elevators were in the middle. Matthew edged toward the opening, checking the space first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clear,” he said, then faded out, moving so fast that when he hit the elevator button, my eyes couldn’t track him until he was beside us again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the doors slid open, we moved at once, filling the steel elevator. Apparently the stairwells were under password and I wondered what the heck people did to get out in case of emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the elevator, noting a few blackish-red shiny parts in the flickering overhead light. I half expected to be doused with onyx while we waited, but it didn’t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s hand brushed mine, and I looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I shifted my weight restlessly. This seemed like the slowest-moving elevator in the world. I could figure out a trig formula faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon squeezed my hand, as if he could sense my nervousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched up on the tips of my toes and cupped Daemon’s cheek, guiding his head down to mine. I kissed him deeply and without reservation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For good luck,” I said after I pulled back, a bit breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis emerald eyes glinted with a wealth of promises that sent a very different kind of chills over me. When we got home, we were so getting some one-on-one time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we would get home, all of us. There could be no other outcome\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the elevator doors popped open, revealing a small waiting room. White walls. White ceilings. White floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d stepped into an insane asylum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lovely decorative colors,” Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother moved ahead, stopping at the door. There was no way, no idea of seeing what waited for us on the other side. With this code, we were going in blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we’d come this far. Excitement hummed through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Careful, brother,” Daemon said. “We take this slow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “I’ve never been here. Blake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake moved to his side. “Should be another tunnel, shorter and wider, and there’ll be doors on the right side. Cells, really, outfitted with a bed, a TV, and a bathroom. There’ll be about twenty rooms. I don’t know if the others are occupied or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers? I hadn’t thought about others. I looked at Daemon. “We can’t just leave them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could answer, Blake intervened. “We don’t have time, Katy. Taking too many will slow us down, and we don’t know what kind of condition they are in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For once, I agree with Blake.” Daemon met my shocked stare. “We can’t, Kitten. Not now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t okay with this, but I couldn’t run down the hall, letting people free. We didn’t plan for that and we only had a set amount of time. It sucked—sucked worse than people who pirated books, sucked more than waiting a year for the next book in a beloved series, and sucked more than a brutal cliffhanger ending. Leaving here, knowing we could possibly be leaving innocent people behind, would haunt me forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake took a deep breath and keyed in the last code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaedalus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of several locks sucking back into place broke the silence and a light at the top of the door, on the right, flashed green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Blake inched the door open, Daemon moved to stand in front of me. Matthew was suddenly behind me and I was shielded. What the…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re clear,” Blake said, sounding relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went through the door, discovering another onyx shield. Now we had two more to get the others through. This wasn’t going to be easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel was like the one above, but all white and like Blake had informed us, it was shorter and wider. Everyone was moving but me. We’d made it—we were here. My stomach lurched and my skin tingled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/opal-lux-3/page-55.html","bookId":1663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:38 PM"}
