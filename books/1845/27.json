By the time he returned to the hall, her stomach was growling for food and she was so sleepy, she could barely hold her head up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband\u0027s manner was brisk now, and she noticed that though he\u0027d had no difficulty whatsoever lingering during his reunion with his stepmother, he couldn\u0027t show his wife half as much consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are four chambers upstairs, Brenna. The kitchens are in a separate building behind the hall, should you ever feel the need to go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clasped hold of her hand and led her up the staircase. She was thankful the steps weren\u0027t nearly as steep as the ones leading up from the soldiers\u0027 quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is there a banister here and not below? Was there a reason for not building one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he answered. \"Are you really hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could eat a little something. I\u0027m still waiting for you to tell me why there isn\u0027t a railing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easier to push soldiers down, that\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought he was jesting. When he didn\u0027t smile, she changed her mind. \"That\u0027s rather impolite, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t understand she was teasing him and apparently didn\u0027t feel her question merited an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the landing, he motioned to the dark hallway behind her. \"There are three chambers there. Our bedroom is on the other side of the landing, straight ahead of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t move fast enough to suit him. He pulled her along and stopped only after they\u0027d entered the chamber. The door slammed shut behind him with a resounding thud. It was completely dark inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor crossed the chamber and pulled back the covering over the window to let the light come in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna let out a sigh of relief because the room wasn\u0027t nearly as bad as she thought it would be. There was a nice-sized hearth at one end of the chamber and a bed at the opposite end. Two low chests flanked the sides, with several candles on top of each. Other than a few hooks placed high up on the wall beside the door, there wasn\u0027t anything more to be noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried over to the window to see the view and immediately wished she hadn\u0027t bothered. Straight ahead was the courtyard and then the ruins, a gloomy picture to be sure, and since she didn\u0027t want to dwell on the past now, she went to the bed to find out if it was lumpy or soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a very nice bed,\" she remarked. \"And so is the room. You live like a peasant, don\u0027t you, Connor, without any unnecessary luxuries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answered. \"May I have a bath?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow I\u0027ll take you to the lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight, if you please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe relented. \"I\u0027ll have a bath prepared. You\u0027ll have to wait while the water is heated in the kitchens and carried up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I would not put your staff to such trouble. I could bathe in the kitchens, couldn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t surprised by her thoughtfulness because he\u0027d already noticed she put the concerns of others before her own, no matter how much she was inconvenienced. Or injured, he thought to add, for she had put Grace\u0027s safety above her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you may bathe in the kitchens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I also eat there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door to leave, but hesitated at the threshold, frowning as he noticed once again the dark shadows under her eyes. In the soft light they seemed more pronounced. He felt responsible for her exhaustion because he\u0027d pushed her too hard, and while he regretted putting her through such a difficult ordeal, there really hadn\u0027t been any other choice. MacNare and his soldiers had been gaining on them, and getting her to safety far outweighed her need for sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you rest beside me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that Euphemia is here, are you still intent on leaving tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think she liked me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she liked you. You shouldn\u0027t need my reassurance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will she stay with us a long while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so,\" he answered on his way out the door. \"I haven\u0027t asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t forget to send one of your men to find Gilly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t forget. Any other questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither his gruff attitude nor his frown deterred her. She hurried over to the doorway, leaned up on her tiptoes, and kissed him. She was very thorough. Connor put his arm around her waist, hauled her up against him, and kissed her a second time, far more passionately than he\u0027d intended to and not nearly as long as he wanted. She ended the kiss by pulling away from him. She saw the bewilderment in his eyes, turned around so he wouldn\u0027t see her smile, and then thought to tell him he could now take his leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was halfway down the stairs before he realized he\u0027d been dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan had to tell him he was smiling. The soldier wanted to know why his laird was happy, leaving Connor no choice but to admit he didn\u0027t have the faintest idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it wasn\u0027t possible, the ruins of Connor\u0027s father\u0027s home seemed to have moved closer, and no matter where Brenna stood in the room, whenever she looked outside, the destruction was all she could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t stop staring at the depressing sight. She knew his father had died there, but had Connor witnessed his death? She hoped he hadn\u0027t because she couldn\u0027t even begin to imagine how painful it would be to watch her own dear father die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on her door was a welcome intrusion to such sad thoughts. A soldier carried in her baggage, and the minute she was left alone again, she pulled out a change of clothing, her brush and two ribbons, and hurried downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a soul on the main floor, and not a sound could be heard coming from outside. She didn\u0027t like the silence at all. She was used to being surrounded by family, servants, and visitors, and she knew it was going to take time for her to adjust to the change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cook was coming to fetch her and had pushed the back door open just as Brenna was reaching for the handle. It took the woman a moment to recover from her surprise. She backed down the steps, bowed low, and introduced herself in such a low voice, it was as though she were confessing her sins to a priest and didn\u0027t wish to be overheard. Her name was Ada. She was twice Brenna\u0027s height, extremely rounded in her middle, and had enough gray in her braid to suggest she was getting on in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth her gentle manner and soft voice reminded Brenna of her mother, and she took to the woman at once. Ada was just as bossy as Brenna\u0027s mother, too. Once she assisted her mistress into the steaming water, Ada refused to give her any soap until Brenna promised not to wash her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women conversed with one another using a combination of Gaelic and gestures. Ada spoke with a brogue so thick and garbled, Brenna could catch only a word or two out of her long, rambling explanations. She finally pointed to the stitches on her mistress\u0027s forehead, frowned, and vehemently shook her head. Brenna concluded she didn\u0027t want her to get the stitches wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAda didn\u0027t notice the bruise on the back of her thigh until she helped Brenna get out of the wooden tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman clucked over her like a mother hen, and in her attempt to show how sympathetic she was, she pounded so roughly on Brenna\u0027s shoulder, she very nearly sent Brenna sailing across the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter wrapping the laird\u0027s new wife in a blanket, Ada demanded to know the story behind Brenna\u0027s injuries. Brenna tried several times to explain the circumstances, but the only words the woman understood were those conveying the fact that she\u0027d fallen down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna tried to put on the clothes she\u0027d brought down from her baggage, but Ada wouldn\u0027t let her. She snatched the garments out of her hands and handed her new clothing instead. Brenna knew Connor was responsible for the thoughtfulness because Ada kept bowing her head and saying \"Laird MacAlister\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Brenna was dressed in a pale gold gown with a MacAlister plaid overskirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAda insisted on helping her get to the kitchen\u0027s table. Telling the woman she didn\u0027t need her assistance proved useless. The woman\u0027s mind was already made up, and it was futile to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna didn\u0027t have any idea what it was she had been given to eat, but the flavor and the aroma were so wonderful she had to have a large second helping. Both the food and Ada\u0027s companionship invigorated her. She wasn\u0027t ready to go to bed after all and decided to explore outside until dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute she stepped outside the kitchen door, she heard men shouting. The noise seemed to be coming from the courtyard. It sounded as though quite a crowd had gathered, with everyone trying to be heard at the same time, and Brenna was curious to find out what was happening. She saw some men running up the slope toward the front of the keep, their expressions grim. Instinctively, she proceeded more cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she reached the side of the keep, the courtyard was silent. She thought the soldiers must have continued on toward the crest, but when she turned the corner and saw them standing in a wide circle, she came to an abrupt stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one, the soldiers stared toward the center of the circle. They seemed transfixed. Brenna noticed that three of the men were wearing plaids different from the MacAlister\u0027s. They were the only ones who moved at all. She saw their fearful expressions each time they glanced up to look at her husband. Connor was on the far side of the circle. Had he looked up, he would have seen her standing there, watching, but like the others, his attention was on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collective mood of the men told her something was terribly wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her gaze on her husband as she walked forward, and hoped he would look up at her so she would know whether to come forward or turn away. His rigid stance should have been sufficient warning, yet she was still unprepared for what she was about to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found an opening between two MacAlister soldiers, moved closer, and stood up on her tiptoes trying to see over the shoulders of the men standing in front of her. Just then one of the men moved over a bit and suddenly she was able to look down at the ground and see what the others were staring at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the bloody remains of an animal with a knotted rope twisted about its neck, and at first glance she didn\u0027t understand the significance. Then she noticed what was left of the braided mane and the pretty pink ribbon tied into a perfect little bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact struck her like a blow. Bile rushed up to her throat, and with it came her low whimper of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking at her own sweet Gilly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor faced his wife in the circle and waited for her to look at him. He could tell she didn\u0027t immediately understand what she was looking at. He hoped to God she wouldn\u0027t recognize the horse, even though he knew in his heart she would. Why hadn\u0027t he taken the time to remove the damned ribbon the second he\u0027d seen it? Surely that was the only way she would ever have known it was Gilly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ached for her. The pain he saw in her eyes at the moment of recognition made him come close to losing his control. It took all his willpower to stand perfectly still. She made a low sound. He was certain Hugh\u0027s soldiers would think it was just the whisper of the wind, for one man looked up at the sky before turning back to Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna put her hand to her throat, took a step back, and frantically sought out Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to go to her, but he didn\u0027t move and, in fact, knew he couldn\u0027t show her any compassion until after the soldiers had taken their leave. Hugh\u0027s men would return to their laird to report the MacAlister\u0027s reaction, and Connor would be damned for eternity before he would let any outsider know what he thought about the message MacNare had sent him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was worried his wife would scream or break down in front of the witnesses. He wouldn\u0027t blame her, for she felt great affection for her pet, but he prayed she would walk away first. He tried to help her, holding her gaze for a long moment, willing her with his silence and his mask of cold indifference to follow his lead. He knew he was asking too much of her and honestly didn\u0027t know if she could give him what he wanted. Yet, just as he made up his mind to order her back inside, he saw her hand drop down to her side and the color rush back into her face. She straightened to her full height, shuddered once, and gave him a barely perceptible nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him far more than he\u0027d expected. She looked at Hugh\u0027s soldiers, and honest to God, there was a faint smile on her face as though she wanted to welcome them to her home but knew she shouldn\u0027t until her laird introduced her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, he was proud of her. She appeared to be only mildly curious as she studied each man\u0027s face, and when she finished her inspection, she glanced at Connor one last time, bowed to him, and then turned around and walked away with all the dignity and regal bearing of a princess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone watched her leave. Several servants waited by the side of the keep for their mistress, and as Brenna walked past them, one called out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady, what are the men looking at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a dead horse,\" she called out. \"Nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued on at a leisurely pace, and only when she had disappeared around the corner did Hugh\u0027s soldiers turn back to Connor. They were staggered by the grin they saw on Laird MacAlister\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senior of the emissaries addressed the laird. \"Hugh is concerned you\u0027ll decide he had something to do with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrispin stepped forward to answer for his laird. He towered over the soldier, forcing the man to take a hasty step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh has no reason to be concerned. Our laird knows who sent the message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve completed your errand,\" Quinlan announced. \"Leave now and let us get back to important matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of the MacAlister warriors nodded their agreement, and the messenger noted they were all smiling like their laird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I report your laird was inconvenienced and nothing more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Report what you will,\" Connor answered. \"It makes no difference to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want us to take the remains with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave it for our dogs,\" Crispin suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor nodded before he walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe messenger wouldn\u0027t forget what he had witnessed, and when he stood before his laird, he would report only that Laird MacAlister had been vastly amused by the enemy\u0027s message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna made it to the bedroom before she started gagging. She was able to keep the food in her stomach by taking deep breaths and forcing herself to block the image of Gilly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her nausea slowly subsided, she sat down on the side of the bed, gripped her hands together in her lap, and tried to make sense out of the horror. She didn\u0027t weep, for mourning, she believed, should be reserved for men, not animals, and it became a measure of her control that she not give in to the desire. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-27.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM"}
