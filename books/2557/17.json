It really was nothing more than an unexpected chance. A welcome fluke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been on the road again for just over an hour since leaving the cafe. Michael had certainly been right about the isolation of the house in the woods as it had proved impossible to find. It had taken them the best part of the last sixty minutes just to find the road which crossed the valley and their brief euphoria at finally seeming to have made some progress had once again quickly given way to desperation and melancholy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sides of the seemingly endless, twisting roads along which they travelled were lined with tall trees which made it virtually impossible to see very far into the distance in any direction. Irritation inside the van was rapidly mounting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is bloody ridiculous,\u0027 Michael sighed. \u0027There must be something around here somewhere.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was driving again with Emma sitting directly behind. She leant forward and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. He instinctively pulled away, annoyed and frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Calm down,\u0027 she sighed, trying hard to soothe her companion\u0027s nerves despite the fact that her own were tattered and torn. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ll get there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Get where? Fucking hell, all I can see are trees. I haven\u0027t got a clue where we are. We\u0027re probably driving in the wrong direction...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Got it!\u0027 Carl shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Got what?\u0027 Michael snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl had been poring over the pages of a road atlas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I think I\u0027ve found where we are on the map.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well done,\u0027 he said sarcastically. \u0027Now can you find that bloody house?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m trying,\u0027 he replied. \u0027It\u0027s not easy. I can\u0027t see any landmarks or anything to check against.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So can you see any buildings round here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hold on...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl struggled to focus his eyes on the map. He was being thrown from side to side as Michael followed the winding route of the narrow road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anything?\u0027 Michael pressed impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 Carl eventually replied. \u0027Look, can you slow down a bit? I\u0027m having trouble...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look, if you can\u0027t find any buildings on this road,\u0027 the other man interrupted angrily, \u0027do you think you could tell us how to get to another road that might actually lead somewhere?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause as Carl again studied the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s not very much round here at all...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shit,\u0027 Michael cursed. \u0027There must be something...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Will you take it easy,\u0027 Emma said from the back. \u0027We\u0027ll get there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael thumped the steering wheel in frustration and then swung the van around a sharp bend in the road. He had to fight to keep control of the vehicle and then was forced to steer hard in the other direction to avoid driving into the back end of a car which had crashed into the hedge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If I\u0027ve got this right then we should reach another bend in the road soon,\u0027 Carl said, sensing that they needed some definite direction. \u0027Just after the bend there\u0027s a junction. Take a right there and we\u0027ll be on a main road in a couple of miles.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What good\u0027s a main road? I just want a road with buildings on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And I\u0027m trying to find you one,\u0027 Carl shouted. \u0027Fucking hell, do you want to swap places \u0027cause all you\u0027ve done is criticise everything I\u0027ve tried to...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Bend coming,\u0027 Emma sighed, cutting right through their argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout slowing down at all Michael steered round the sharp turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay, here\u0027s the junction,\u0027 he said. \u0027Was it right or left here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right...\u0027 Carl replied. He wasn\u0027t completely sure but he didn\u0027t dare admit it. He turned the map round in his hands and then turned it back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re positive?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course I\u0027m positive,\u0027 he yelled. \u0027Just bloody well turn right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeething with anger and not thinking straight, in the heat of the moment Michael screwed up and turned left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shit,\u0027 he hissed under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You idiot, what the hell did you do that for?\u0027 Carl screamed. \u0027You ask me which way to go, I tell you, and then you go in the opposite bloody direction. Why bother asking? Why don\u0027t I throw this fucking book out of the window?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll throw you out of the fucking window,\u0027 Michael threatened. He became quiet as the road narrowed dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Keep going,\u0027 suggested Emma. \u0027There\u0027s no way you\u0027re going to be able to turn the van around here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe width of the road narrowed alarmingly, and the tarmac beneath their wheels became potted and uneven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What the hell is this?\u0027 Carl demanded, still livid. \u0027You\u0027re driving us down a fucking dirt track!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than stop and admit defeat, Michael instead slammed his foot down harder on the accelerator, forcing the van up a sudden steep rise. The front right wheel clattered through a deep pothole filled with dark rain water which splashed up, showering the front of the van. He switched on the wipers to clear the muddy windscreen but, rather than clear the glass, they instead did little more than smear the greasy mud right across his field of vision, reducing his already limited visibility further still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There,\u0027 he said, squinting into the distance and looking a little further down the track. \u0027There\u0027s a clearing up ahead. I\u0027ll try and turn round there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t so much a clearing, rather a length of track where there was no hedgerow on one side and where there had once been a gate into an adjacent field. Michael slowed the van down to almost a dead stop and put it into first gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait!\u0027 Carl shouted. \u0027Down there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed through a gap in the trees on the other side of the road. Michael again used the wipers to clear the windscreen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027 he asked, a little calmer now that they had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can see it,\u0027 Emma said. \u0027There\u0027s a house.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s tired and wandering eyes finally settled on the isolated building. He turned and looked at both Carl and Emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do you think?\u0027 Carl asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than bother to answer he instead slammed his foot down on the accelerator again and sent the van flying down the track. Like a runner suddenly in sight of the finishing line there was a new found energy and steely determination about his actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA staggering body appeared from the darkness of the trees at the side of the track (only the fifth they\u0027d seen since leaving the cafe) and wandered into the path of the van. His reflexes slowed by fatigue, Michael yanked the steering wheel to the left and swerved around the miserable creature, scraping the van against the hedge on the other side. For a fraction of a second he watched in the rear view mirror. The corpse stumbled on across the track and through the undergrowth on the other side, completely oblivious to the van which had just thundered past, missing it by inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael forced the van over another slight rise. Once over the top the survivors had a clear view of the building in the near distance. The track which they were following led directly to the front door of the large house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Looks perfect,\u0027 Emma said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe uneven road became less defined with each passing metre. It swooped down through a dense forest in a gentle arc and then crossed over a little humped-back stone bridge. The bridge itself spanned the width of a gentle stream which meandered down the hillside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a farm,\u0027 Carl mumbled with remarkable perceptiveness as they passed an abandoned tractor and plough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can\u0027t see any animals though,\u0027 Emma muttered, thinking out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael wound down the window and sniffed the cool air. She was right\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he couldn\u0027t see or smell a single cow, pig, sheep, chicken, duck or horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Must have been an arable farm,\u0027 he said as he stopped the van in the centre of a large gravel yard, right in front of the house. Without saying anything else he climbed out and stretched, glad to finally be out of the driving seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apparent tranquility of their isolated location belied the turmoil and devastation that they had left behind them. The three survivors stood together in silence and took stock of their surroundings. They were standing in a farmyard, about twenty metres square, boxed in by the stream, the farm buildings and the forest and littered with rusting farm machinery and unused supplies. On the furthest side of the yard (opposite to where the track crossed the bridge) were two dilapidated wooden barns. The farmhouse itself was a large and traditional brick-built building with a sloping grey roof which was dotted with green and yellow lichen. From the front the house appeared to be roughly rectangular. Three stone steps led up to a wooden porch which was the only protruding feature. Tacked to the side of the building was an out-of-place looking concrete garage with a grey metal door. Twisting ivy covered between a half and a third of the front of the building and the unchecked leaves had begun to crawl from the house across the roof of the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This looks perfect,\u0027 Emma continued to enthuse. \u0027What do you two think?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he was standing closest to her she first looked towards Michael for a response. Not for the first time today he seemed to be miles away, wrapped up in his own private thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027 he mumbled, annoyed that he had been disturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I said it looks perfect,\u0027 she repeated. \u0027What do you think, Carl?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not bad,\u0027 he said nonchalantly, leaning against the side of the van. He was deliberately trying to hide the fact that being out in the open scared him. He didn\u0027t know who (or what) was watching them. \u0027It\u0027ll do for tonight.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael slowly climbed the steps to the front door. He opened the porch and stepped inside. The other two watched from a distance, keen to know if anyone was home but too unsure to get any closer. Michael, on the other hand, was too tired to waste any more time. He banged on the door with his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hello,\u0027 he yelled. \u0027Hello, is anyone there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl found the volume of his voice unsettling. He looked around anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, after a few seconds, there had been no reply to his shouting and thumping, Michael tried the door. It was open and he stepped inside. Emma and Carl looked at each other for a moment before following him. By the time they were both standing in the hallway he had already been into every room downstairs and was working his way through the second storey. He eventually reappeared at the top of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well?\u0027 asked Emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It looks okay,\u0027 he replied breathlessly as he walked back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anyone in?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and pointed towards a room on their right. Emma peered through the door into a large and comfortable sitting room. A single body\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an overweight, white-haired man wearing a dressing gown, trousers and slippers\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;lay twisted painfully on the ground in front of an ornate open fireplace. Feeling a little safer now he knew that this was the only body, Carl went into the sitting room and walked over to the corpse. There was an unopened letter on the ground next to the man\u0027s lifeless hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This must be Mr Jones,\u0027 he mumbled, reading from the address on the front of the envelope. \u0027Mr Arthur Jones, Penn Farm. Nice place you had here, Mr Jones.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No sign of Mrs Jones?\u0027 wondered Emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Couldn\u0027t find anyone else,\u0027 Michael replied, shaking his head. \u0027And he looks too old for there to be any little Joneses here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma noticed that Carl had sat down next to the body. He was staring into its face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 she asked. No response. \u0027Carl, what\u0027s the matter?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, looked up at her and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sorry, I was miles away.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl quickly looked away, hoping that the other two hadn\u0027t picked up on the sudden anxiety and unease he was feeling. Christ, he thought, he had seen literally thousands of dead bodies over the last few days, so why did this one in particular bother him? Was it because this had been one of the first bodies he\u0027d actually sat down and looked at, or was it because this was the first body he\u0027d seen with an identity? He knew the man\u0027s name and what he\u0027d done for a living and they had broken into his home. It didn\u0027t feel right. He didn\u0027t believe in ghosts or anything like that but, at that moment, he was convinced that somehow Mr Jones would get his revenge on the three intruders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael sat down in a comfortable armchair and shielded his eyes from the early evening sunlight which poured into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So will this do?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Think we should stop here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s plenty of room,\u0027 Emma replied, \u0027and there\u0027s the stream outside for water.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And it\u0027s not easy to get to,\u0027 Carl added, forcing himself to get involved in the conversation and ignore Mr Jones. \u0027Bloody hell, we had enough trouble finding it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And it\u0027s a farm,\u0027 Michael said. \u0027There\u0027s bound to be much more to this place than just this house.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like what?\u0027 Emma wondered. Michael shrugged his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he grinned. \u0027Let\u0027s find out, shall we?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that he jumped up from his seat and left the room. Carl and Emma followed him as he walked down the hallway with the entrance to the kitchen and the wooden staircase on his left and a succession of rooms on the right. He looked into (but didn\u0027t go into) a living room and a small office as he walked towards the back of the house. He stopped by the back door and looked back at the other two over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There you go,\u0027 he said, grinning again. \u0027Told you. That should help.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntrigued, Carl and Emma peered past him. On the small lawn at the back of the house was a large gas cylinder mounted on a firm concrete base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wonder what\u0027s in the shed,\u0027 Carl mumbled, looking into the trees at the bottom left hand corner of the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Probably just tools,\u0027 Emma guessed. \u0027You know, lawnmowers, that kind of thing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then what are those?\u0027 he said, nodding into a small store room to his left. Emma peered into the gloom and saw that everything she had thought would have been kept in the shed had been housed in this little room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Only one way to find out,\u0027 she said and she stretched past Michael and opened the door. She led the three of them across the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was obvious that this was far more than just an ordinary garden shed. It was too big and strong to be a potting shed and too small to be anything to do with the farm stores. Carl pushed the door open and leant inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s in there?\u0027 Michael shouting, watching the other man with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl reappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You won\u0027t believe this,\u0027 he gasped. \u0027It\u0027s only a bloody generator!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What? For making electricity,\u0027 Emma said stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I bloody hope so,\u0027 Michael sighed under his breath. \u0027That\u0027s what they usually do.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Will it work?\u0027 she then asked, equally stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 Carl replied, \u0027I\u0027ll have a go at getting it going later.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve got plenty of time to try,\u0027 Michael added as he turned and walked back towards the house. \u0027Think we should stop here then?\u0027 he asked sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Carl or Emma bothered to answer but it didn\u0027t matter. Individually they had all decided to stop the first moment they\u0027d arrived. Penn Farm seemed the ideal place for them to sit and wait. What they would be waiting for, however, was anyone\u0027s guess. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-17.html","bookId":2557,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM"}
