{"id":37025,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. ON THE TRAIN.","content":"His valise filled with a stock of necessary underwear, Robert walked to the railway station. It was a very sudden start, and he had no time to consider what he was to do, for the train moved off five minutes after his arrival.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He selected a seat by a window, and placed his valise on the seat beside his own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was not till the train had fairly started that he began to realize the importance of the step that he was taking. He was leaving a comfortable, nay, a luxurious home, where he was provided with every comfort, and by his own choice was undertaking to earn his own living. It was enough to make any boy feel serious. But Robert was manly and resolute, and he decided that anything would be better than to live under the same roof with his odious step-father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five minutes later a tall thin man walked over from the opposite side of the car, and said, \"Will you allow me to sit beside you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 52]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly,\" answered Robert courteously, and removed his grip-sack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you. I am tired of sitting alone, and thought I should like a chat with an intelligent young man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you think I am an intelligent young man?\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sure of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am very much obliged, but what makes you think so?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am well versed in character reading, being a professional phrenologist and a student of physiognomy. Are you going to the city?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir. I think so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So am I. Are you connected with any business house there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not yet, sir. I may be before long.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I may be able to help you get a place. I am extensively acquainted with business firms. But perhaps you have a place already secured?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you well acquainted in Chicago?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know scarcely anyone there—no one of any prominence.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You may have to wait for a position. Pardon me—it is none of my business—but you ought[Pg 53] to have money enough to carry you on a few weeks in case you have to wait.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have some money,\" said Robert cautiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is well. I am glad to hear it. Are you well educated?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tolerably so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know anything about bookkeeping?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have a brother-in-law who is a commission merchant. Indeed I may say that Mr. Claflin, the great merchant, is a cousin of mine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was once in Claflin\u0027s employ,\" continued the stranger. \"I was head of one of the departments, with a salary of five thousand dollars a year.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What made you leave so good a place?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t wonder you ask. It was because Claflin interfered with me. I felt that I ought to have full charge of my department, and would tolerate no interference. He interfered with me, and in a fit of anger I threw up my position. I dare say you think me foolish?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I do,\" answered Robert frankly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are right, but an angry man doesn\u0027t stop to consider. Claflin seemed surprised, and no doubt he was sorry, but he is a proud man and he[Pg 54] wouldn\u0027t demean himself by asking me to stay. So I put on my coat and left.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you got on well since?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I went over to a rival merchant, but had to take less pay. Still I got on very well, till last spring, when I had an attack of malaria. That broke me down in health and pocket, and now I am what you call hard up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hadn\u0027t you saved up anything from your large salary?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but I invested in running stock, and lost all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder what he is telling me all this for?\" mused Robert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have about recovered my health, and now I shall soon get a good place,\" went on the stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here Robert took out his watch—it was an excellent Waltham silver watch—and consulted it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me look at your watch!\" said the stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert put it in his hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A very good watch! Let me show you mine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He drew from his pocket a showy gold watch—at least it was yellow, and had a good appearance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you think of it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 55]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is showy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, and is of high grade. It is well worth seventy-five dollars, though I have had it for three years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert was not especially interested. His own watch had cost but twenty-five, but it was a gift from his father, and as such he valued it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have a great mind to offer you a bargain,\" said his companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert looked at him inquiringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you will give me ten dollars to boot, I will exchange with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why should you do that? You say your watch is worth seventy-five dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So it is, but, my young friend, I am very short of money. The silver watch would keep as good time, and the money would be of great service to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My watch was a present,\" he said, \"I should not care to part with it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course, that is a consideration,\" said the stranger, appearing disappointed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Besides I could not very well spare ten dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You could easily pawn the watch for forty dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 56]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why don\u0027t you do that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Egad! I didn\u0027t think of it. I believe I will. By the way, will you do me a favor?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you keep the watch for fifteen minutes? I am going out into the smoking-car, and I may go to sleep. That is the way smoking affects me. I might get robbed, but if you hold the watch I shall feel easy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This seemed a strange proposal to make, but after all it was plausible. It seemed a trifling favor to grant. Why should he object?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But how do you know I am honest,\" asked Robert. \"You have only known me a few minutes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Didn\u0027t I tell you I was skilled in reading character? You have an honest face.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you for your favorable opinion.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you consent?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. How long will you be gone?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I shall come back before we reach the city.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, if you are anxious to have me take charge of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; I shall feel safe if it is in your hands.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert wore a sack coat with pockets on each[Pg 57] side. He put the watch in one of these pockets, and resumed looking out of the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His companion left the car and went to the car in the rear, which was the smoking-car.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Half an hour passed, and then a stout, thick-set man of thirty-five entered the car and walked through it, looking at the passengers as he passed along.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He paused in front of Robert\u0027s seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Young man,\" he said, \"show me your watch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert looked at him in astonishment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I mean that I have had my watch stolen, and I am sure some passenger has taken it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What kind of a watch was it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was a gold watch. Have you such a watch about you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never mind about any buts,\" said the other fiercely. \"I can tell by your expression that you have got my watch. Let me have it at once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A gentleman, now in the smoking-car, gave me a watch to keep for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you have it about you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give it to me at once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 58]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I couldn\u0027t, without his permission.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That won\u0027t go down. Either give me the watch, or I will have you arrested.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no right to give you the watch. If it is yours it was stolen by the man who handed it to me to keep for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I give you two minutes to produce the watch. If you will do this, and pay me ten dollars besides, I will overlook your offense.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert\u0027s face flushed. He felt that he was in a tight place. This man might be a confederate of the other. But how was he to prove it?\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52291.html","bookId":1053,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM"}
