Becker squinted in the stark lighting. It was the kid he\u0027d chased onto the bus. He glumly surveyed the sea of red, white, and blue coiffures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with the hair?\" Becker moaned, motioning to the others. \"It\u0027s all...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red, white, and blue?\" the kid offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker nodded, trying not to stare at the infected perforation in the kid\u0027s upper lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judas Taboo,\" the kid said matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker looked bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punk spit in the aisle, obviously disgusted with Becker\u0027s ignorance. \"Judas Taboo? Greatest punk since Sid Vicious? Blew his head off here a year ago today. It\u0027s his anniversary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker nodded vaguely, obviously missing the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taboo did his hair this way the day he signed off.\" The kid spit again. \"Every fan worth his weight in piss has got red, white, and blue hair today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment, Becker said nothing. Slowly, as if he had been shot with a tranquilizer, he turned and faced front. Becker surveyed the group on the bus. Every last one was a punk. Most were staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery fan has red, white, and blue hair today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker reached up and pulled the driver-alert cord on the wall. It was time to get off. He pulled again. Nothing happened. He pulled a third time, more frantically. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They disconnect \u0027em on bus 27.\" The kid spat again. \"So we don\u0027t fuck with \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker turned. \"You mean, I can\u0027t get off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid laughed. \"Not till the end of the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, the bus was barreling along an unlit Spanish country road.
