You …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used every bad word he knew to curse Dragon Fifth as loudly as possible.

Excellent cursing! Really f*cking excellent cursing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of laughing was accompanied by the sound of galloping horses.

He was older, and his face seemed hateful, especially his eyes, which stared at the woman’s plump, round posterior.

Then he returned to the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman wasn’t feeding the ducks any more. The couple were already sitting at the gate.

He waved his hand, and the driver immediately produced four large boxes filled with silver ingots, placing them in the courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This here is worth fifty silver, and these boxes altogether contain one thousand two hundred ingots.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s eyes bulged.

They will all be here for you when you return.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s face turned crimson, and sweat began dripping down his face.
