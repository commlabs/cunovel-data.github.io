{"id":23122,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. A STORE IN THE BOWERY.","content":"T HE store was crowded with a miscellaneous collection of cheap articles. That such a business should yield such large profits struck Oliver with surprise, but he reflected that it was possible, and that he was not qualified to judge of the extent of trade in a city store.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A tall man, pock-marked, and with reddish hair, stood behind the counter, and, with the exception of a young clerk of nineteen, appeared to be the only salesman. This was Ezekiel Bond.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How are you, Ezekiel?\" said Mr. Kenyon affably, advancing to the counter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pretty well, thank you, uncle,\" said the other, twisting his features into the semblance of a smile. \"When did you come into town?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This morning only.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That isn\u0027t Roland, is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no; it is my step-son, Oliver Conrad. Oliver, this is my nephew, Ezekiel Bond.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Glad to see you, Mr. Conrad,\" said Ezekiel, putting out his hand as if he were a pump-handle. \"Do you like New York?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I haven\u0027t seen much of it yet. I think I shall.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ezekiel,\" said Mr. Kenyon, \"can I see you a few minutes in private?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, certainly. We\u0027ll go into the back room. Will Mr. Conrad come, too?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; he can remain with your clerk while we converse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"John, take care of Mr. Conrad,\" said Ezekiel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John Meadows was a Bowery boy, and better adapted for the store he was in than for one in a more fashionable thoroughfare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The boss wants me to entertain you,\" he remarked, when they were alone. \"How shall I do it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself,\" said Oliver, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d offer you a cigarette, only the boss don\u0027t allow smoking in the store.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t smoke,\" said Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t! Where was you brung up?\" asked John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the country.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, that accounts for it. Mean ter say you\u0027ve never puffed a weed?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never have.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you don\u0027t know what \u0027tis to enjoy yourself. Who\u0027s that man you came in with?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My step-father.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve seen him here before. He\u0027s related to my boss. I don\u0027t think any more of him for that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not?\" asked Oliver, rather amused. \"Don\u0027t you like Mr. Bond?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come here,\" said John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver approached the counter, and leaning over, John whispered mysteriously:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s a file!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A what?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A file, and an awful rasping one at that. He\u0027s as mean as dirt.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sorry to hear that, for Mr. Kenyon wants me to begin business in this store.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John whistled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s a go,\" he said. \"Are you going to do it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose I shall try it. If I don\u0027t like it I can give it up at any time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I wish I was you. I don\u0027t like it, but I can\u0027t give it up, or I might have to live on nothing a week. I don\u0027t see what the boss wants an extra hand for. There aint enough trade to keep us busy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Kenyon tells me Mr. Bond has made money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I am glad to hear it. The boss is always a-complainin\u0027 that trade is dull, and he must cut me down. If he does I\u0027ll sink into a hungry grave, that\u0027s all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How much do you get?\" asked Oliver, amused by his companion\u0027s tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eight dollars a week; and what\u0027s that to support a gentleman on? I tell you what, I haven\u0027t had a new necktie for three months.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is hard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hard! I should say it was hard. Look at them shoes!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And John, bounding over the counter, displayed a foot which had successfully struggled out of its encasement on one side. \"Isn\u0027t it disgraceful that a gentleman should have to wear such foot-cases as them?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Won\u0027t Mr. Bond pay you more?\" asked Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess not. I asked him last week, and he lectured me on the dulness of trade. Then he went on for to show that eight dollars was a fortune, and I\u0027d orter keep my carriage on it. He\u0027s a regular old file, he is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From what you say, I don\u0027t think I shall get very high pay,\" said Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s different with you. You\u0027re a relation. You\u0027ll be took care of.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not related to Mr. Bond,\" said Oliver, sensible of a feeling of repugnance. \"If it depends on that, I shall expect no favors.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ll get \u0027em, all the same. His uncle\u0027s your step-father.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where do you live?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I\u0027ve got a room round on Bleecker Street. It\u0027s about big enough for a good-sized cat to live in. I have to double myself up nights so as not to overflow into the entry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why don\u0027t you get a better room?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why don\u0027t I live on Fifth Avenue, and set up my carriage? \u0027Cause it can\u0027t be done on eight dollars a week. I have to live accordin\u0027 to my income.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s where you are right. How much do you have to pay for your room?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A dollar and a half a week.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t ask from curiosity. I suppose I shall have to get a place somewhere.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When you get ready, come to me. I\u0027ll find you a place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here an old lady entered—an old lady from the country evidently, in a bombazine dress and a bonnet which might have been in fashion twenty years before. She was short-sighted, and peered inquisitively at Oliver and John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which of you youngsters keeps this store?\" she enquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am the gentleman, ma\u0027am,\" said John, with a flourish.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, you be! Well, I\u0027m from the country.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never should have thought it, ma\u0027am. You look like an uptown lady I know—Mrs. General Buster.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t say,\" returned the old lady, evidently feeling complimented. \"I\u0027m Mrs. Deacon Grimes of Pottsville.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is the deacon well?\" asked John, with a ludicrous assumption of interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s pooty smart,\" answered Mrs. Grimes, \"though he\u0027s troubled sometimes with a pain in the back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So am I,\" said John; \"but I know what to do for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have somebody rub me down with a brick-bat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The deacon wouldn\u0027t allow no one to do that,\" said the old lady, accepting the remedy in good faith.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can I sell you a silk necktie this morning, ma\u0027am?\" asked John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; I want some handkerchers for the deacon; red silk ones he wants.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We haven\u0027t any of that kind. Here\u0027s some nice cotton ones, a good deal cheaper.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will they wash?\" asked Mrs. Grimes cautiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course they will. We import \u0027em ourselves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I don\u0027t know. If you\u0027ll sell \u0027em real cheap I\u0027ll take two.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then ensued a discussion of the price, which Oliver found very amusing. Finally the old lady took two handkerchiefs and retired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that the way you do business?\" asked Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. We have all sorts of customers, and have to please \u0027em all. The old woman wanted to know if they would wash. The color\u0027ll all wash out in one washing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am afraid you cheated her, then.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the odds? She wasn\u0027t willing to pay for a good article.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t believe I can do business that way,\" thought Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then Mr. Kenyon returned with Ezekiel Bond from the back room in which they had been conferring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all settled, Oliver,\" he said. \"Mr. Bond has agreed to take you, and you are to begin work next Monday morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver bowed. The place did not seem quite so desirable to him now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will be on hand,\" he answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Mr. Kenyon and he had left the store, the former said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Every Saturday evening Mr. Bond will hand you twelve dollars, out of which you will be expected to defray all your expenses.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The other clerk told me he only got eight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Part of this sum comes from me. I don\u0027t want you to be pinched. You have been brought up differently from him. I hope you\u0027ll like my nephew.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope I shall,\" said Oliver, but his tone implied doubt.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59221.html","bookId":527,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM"}
