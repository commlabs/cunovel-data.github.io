This region was definitely hiding something, an order, a function like self destruction at a critical moment, or perhaps potential to be aroused. It might even be there just to erase certain traces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eJust as Su was searching for a way to decipher this mystery, an especially vicious blood speck finally couldn’t suppress its instincts, taking a ‘nibble’ at the nerve. When it bit down, the nerve bundle immediately reacted. It trembled, sent out a signal, and then became still like a piece of dead flesh.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis signal was seized by the blood specks and flesh feelers, and it was amplified before being transmitted back to Su’s body. Upon receiving this signal, before Su displayed any reaction, his body already instinctively responded. All of the blood specks shook at the same time, producing hundreds of different frequency type sound waves and force fields. These wave fields continuously changed from one frequency to the other. Finally, one wave touched upon a certain mysterious frequency, and then this entire region came alive!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that instant, Su’s mind made contact with a brand new world. That was an ocean world, ice cold, dark, and lonely. There was only a single lord in that world, and there was only a single life. That was an inconceivably enormous existence. At the very least, the consciousness it projected was already as vast as a sea!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA world-shaking voice suddenly sounded within Su’s consciousness! The moment Su made contact with the other party’s spiritual world, the other party also saw Su. In that instant, the two spiritual worlds were virtually connected.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Who is prying into my secrets?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that instant, the world seemed to only contain this voice!

There were night skies, the world enveloped in a curtain of darkness. There were stars hanging in the sky, and there were continuous mountain ranges that extended for thousands of miles, vast like a true universe. However, though this world was as vast as a universe, beneath Su’s feet was an extremely desolate and large star, his consciousness itself was about the size of a human’s. As these two spiritual worlds joined up, endless ocean water was currently flooding over.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat Su faced was an angry sea that could drown out an entire solar system!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this moment, Su didn’t think anything else, nor did he hesitate.

The fishman’s hindbrain ruptured, releasing a several meter long blood arrow.

The sudden impact left Cirvanas feeling a wave of dizziness, not understanding what exactly happened. However, he knew that Su’s vitality was quickly flowing away, already closed to withering up, yet showed no sign of stopping! Through the nucleus’ connection with Su, he could clearly sense this point!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWas Su going to die?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis thought was like a rock, one that smashed down again and again on the young man’s consciousness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf Su died, then the spiritual world would also vanish.

Her casual strike contained six levels of power, so seven or eight of the young man’s ribs were broken.

Madeline’s heavy sword was already pressed against his neck! The rough sword edge was full of knicks, already no sharpness to speak of.

However, he wanted to know why something would suddenly happen to Su. He was even more confused why Madeline would behave so strangely. However, after considering the special relationship between Madeline and Su, Cirvanas still ultimately decided to slowly back up. However, he only withdrew a set distance, and then he was no longer willing to travel any further. Madeline didn’t pay him any attention, only watching Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCirvanas could only see Madeline’s rear figure, unable to see her expression.
