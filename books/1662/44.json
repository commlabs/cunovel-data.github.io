You must’ve taken the wrong exit by a long shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded eagerly. “I’m not from around here. And all the roads and signs look the same. Like the towns all sound the same,” I rambled on, playing the dumb girl. “I’m trying to get to Moorefield.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s lying,” Smoker spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny hope that had sparked in me died in a fiery crash. Smoker came closer, keeping the gun trained on me. With one hand, he reached out and placed his palm against my cheek. His hand smelled of cigarettes and disinfectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See,” the shorter one said, starting to put his gun back into the holster attached to his thigh. “She’s just lost. You’re getting paranoid. Go ahead, honey, get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoker grunted and grasped my other cheek, ignoring his partner. Something warm and sharp was in his palm. Fear spiked my heart rate. Was it a knife?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m lost. I swear—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed-hot, needle-sharp pain streaked across my cheek, slicing down my neck and over my shoulder. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain rushed at me in waves. Blackness inched across my vision, and I doubled over, breaking contact with whatever he held in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ,” the shorter one said. “You’re right. She’s one of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped to my knees as the pain ebbed, leaving a dull ache throbbing deep in my skin. Gulping in air, I placed my hand against my cheek, expecting to find my skin split open, but it was only warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Told you.” Smoker grasped my arm, yanking me forward. When I lifted my head, he had a gun pressed between my eyes. “What’s in this barrel will do far worse. So you better think carefully before you answer the next question. Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeechless, fear held me paralyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook me. “Answer me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on out here?” a new voice asked, coming up from behind the two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoker stepped to the side, and my heart dropped. It was Vaughn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We found her sneaking around back here,” Smoker said, sounding like he’d just caught the biggest catfish to date. “She’s one of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaughn frowned as he moved closer, his bushy mustache blowing as he breathed heavily. “Good job. I’ll take this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t breathe. Vaughn had been inside, where Daemon was. Had he caught Daemon, done something to him? If so, it was entirely my fault. I’d started this by telling him I’d seen Bethany. I may not have controlled where the rock went, but I’d pushed it down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” asked the shorter officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaughn nodded, reaching down and grasping my other arm, hauling me to my feet. “I’ve had my eye on this one for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The cages should be prepped,” Smoker said, letting go of my other arm reluctantly. “It took a while for it to work on her. You might want to double it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCages? My mouth dried up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shorter officer looked me over, eyes narrowing. “Since we caught this one, shouldn’t we get a reward?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reward?” asked Vaughn, voice low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoker laughed. “Yeah, like with the other one. That was one hell of a reward. Husher won’t know any different as long as we don’t mess her up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore my brain could come to terms with what he meant, Vaughn pushed me to the side hard enough I lost my balance and hit the ground. He threw up his hand. Lightning crackled around his arm, flaring red-white as it enveloped his body until he was nothing more than light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped, realizing Vaughn was…Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit!” yelled Smoker, reaching for his gun. “It’s a trick!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulsing with light and power, he released the energy. It struck Smoker first, sending him several feet back. The light arched, smacking into the shorter officer. He too went flying into the side of the building. There was a sickening crunch, and he fell to the ground, skin and clothing smoking. The man shuddered once, and then his face turned to…ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight breeze moved down the building, stirring the fallen man. Pieces of him flicked up into the air, floating away until nothing remained. It was the same where Smoker had fallen. There was nothing left of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s light dimmed, and when I looked at him, he was in his human form. I expected him to flip out about my not staying in the car, but all he did was reach down and take my hand, gently pulling me to my feet. The baseball cap hid his eyes, but his lips were pressed in that hard, unyielding line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to get out of here,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at my house, we sat on the couch, facing each other with our legs crossed. I held a steaming cup of hot cocoa that he’d placed between my hands, but I couldn’t get warm enough. I kept running down everything that had happened, ending with the men turning into ash. It reminded me of the videos of the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima. The blast of heat had been so intense it had turned people to ash and permanently implanted their shadows into buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d driven their car into the woods, and Daemon had then fried it, burning it until there wasn’t much of anything left. Any evidence of us being there had been removed, but eventually people would miss the two men and questions would start getting tossed around, especially from their families. Because they had families…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baseball cap had been tossed onto the coffee table, but I couldn’t read anything in Daemon’s eyes. He’d been quiet the whole way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed the warm mug. “Daemon…are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a sip, I watched him from under my lashes. “What was inside the building?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed the back of his neck as he closed his eyes briefly. “There wasn’t anything in the first couple of rooms. Just empty office space, but it’s obvious the place is used a lot. There were empty coffee cups, filled ashtrays everywhere. The farther I got in, there were…cages. About ten of them; one looked like it was used recently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNausea rolled inside me. “Do you really think they were keeping people in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luxen? Yes. And maybe others like you.” He dropped his hands on his legs. “One of the cages had dried blood in it. All of them had chains and manacles encased in this dark red stone I’ve never seen before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw something outside the building, above the doors. It was shiny, looked black to me because it was dark.” I set my cup aside. “And he put something against my cheek, and God, that hurt like hell. I wonder if it was the same thing you saw.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis poetic lips tipped down at the corners. “How are you feeling now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perfectly fine.” I waved it off. “Did you see anything else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t have time to go upstairs, but I had this feeling that something…something was up there.” He stood with fluid grace, clasping his arms behind his head. “I need to get back in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes followed him. “Daemon, it’s too dangerous. People are going to realize that the officers are missing. You can’t go back there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled around, facing me. “My brother could be in there or something that will tell me where my brother is. I can’t just walk away because it’s too dangerous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand that.” I stood, clenching my hands. “But what good are you to Dawson—or to Dee—if you get caught?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stared at me for several long moments. “I have to do something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but it needs to be more thought out than any of your plans have been so far.” I ignored the flash of temper in his bright gaze. “Because you could’ve been captured tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not worried about myself, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then that’s a problem!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. “I wouldn’t have involved you in this if I knew you were going to wimp out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wimp out?” The events of the night heightened everything I was feeling and I was on overload, seconds from breaking down, sitting in the corner somewhere. Maybe rocking in that corner, too. “I’m the one who involved you. I saw Bethany.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I agreed to let you come with me the first time.” He ran his hand through his messy hair, exhaling roughly. “If you’d stayed in that car, I could’ve had time to check the floors above.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open. “You would’ve been caught inside. I got out of the car because you didn’t respond to my text! If I stayed in there, we’d both be in those cages.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tips of his cheeks flushed as he looked away. “Okay. Both of us are aggravated right now. We should just let it drop for tonight. Get some rest. Whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to let it drop, but he had a point. I crossed my arms. “Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one last look, he grabbed his cap from the table and turned to leave, stopping at the end of the couch. His shoulders shuddered and his voice came out a whisper. “I’ve never killed a human before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, his aggravation made more sense. It wasn’t just the helpless feeling of not being able to do anything. The need to comfort him, to touch him, turned physical. I reached out, placing my hand on his arm. “It’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon shrugged off my hand, scowling. “It’s not okay, Katy. I killed two humans. And don’t—just don’t do anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched, more from the use of my real name than his action. Daemon blinked out, and the front door slammed shut. Running both my hands over my head, I bit down on my lip hard enough for a metallic taste to spring into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon wouldn’t go back to that warehouse. Never in a million years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven I couldn’t convince myself of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep didn’t come easily that night, and I spent the better part of the next day strung tight as a bow pulled too hard. I kept checking the driveway next door, making sure Daemon’s car was there. He could just zip his way back to the warehouse without his SUV, but seeing the car gave me some relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next couple days of winter break crept by. Most of the time I expected SWAT to bust up in my house, demanding to know what happened to the officers. But nothing happened. The day before New Year’s Eve, Dee stopped by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like my new boots?” She stuck out one slender leg. Black leather boots ended just below her knees. The heel was killer. “Daemon got them for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re awesome. What size are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled, then popped a lollipop back in her mouth. “Okay, before you tell me no, I already cleared it with Ash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “Cleared what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ash is throwing a little New Year’s Eve party at her house. It’s just going to be a few of us. Daemon is going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, I doubt Ash is okay with me going to her party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she is.” Dee pinged around the living room like a captured butterfly. “She promised she’d be cool with it. I think you’re growing on her.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-44.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
