I wasn\u0027t too excited about it, but Steve thought it was great. He loved anything to do with killing and war. He often said he wanted to be a soldier of fortune one who fights for money when he grew up. And he meant it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had math after history, and incredibly Mr. Dalton for a third time! Our usual math teacher was out sick, so others had been filling in for him as best they could all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve was in seventh heaven. His favorite teacher, three classes in a row! It was the first time we\u0027d had Mr. Dalton for math, so Steve started showing off, telling him where we were in the book, explaining some of the trickier problems as though speaking to a child. Mr. Dalton didn\u0027t mind. He was used to Steve and knew exactly how to handle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally Mr. Dalton runs a tight ship his classes are fun but we always come out of them having learned something but he wasn\u0027t very good at math. He tried hard but we could tell he was in over his head, and while he was busy trying to come to grips with things his head buried in the math book, Steve by his side making ?helpful? suggestions the rest of us began to fidget and whisper to each other and pass notes around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent a note to Alan, asking to see the mysterious piece of paper he\u0027d brought in. He refused at first to pass it around, but I kept sending notes and finally he gave in. Tommy sits just two seats over from him, so he got it first. He opened it up and began studying it. His face lit up while he was reading and his jaw slowly dropped. When he passed it on to me having read it three times I soon saw why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a flyer, an advertising pamphlet for some sort of traveling circus. There was a picture of a wolf\u0027s head at the top. The wolf had its mouth open and saliva was dripping from its teeth. At the bottom were pictures of a spider and a snake, and they looked vicious, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust beneath the wolf, in big red capital letters, were the words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCIRQUE DU FREAK\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath that, in smaller writing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOR ONE WEEK ONLY CIRQUE DU FREAK!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIVE AND SEERSA THE TWISTING TWINS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SNAKE-BOY! THE WOLF-MAN! GERTHA TEETH!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLARTEN CREPSLEY AND HIS PERFORMING SPIDER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMADAM OCTA! ALEXANDER RIBS! THE BEARDED LADY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHANS HANDS! RHAMUS TWOBELLIES WORLD\u0027S FATTEST MAN!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath all that was an address where you could buy tickets and find out where the show was playing. And right at the bottom, just above the pictures of the snake and spider:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNOT FOR THE FAINTHEARTED! SOME RESTRICTIONS APPLY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cirque Du Freak?\" I muttered softly to myself. Cirque was French for circus...Circus of Freaks! Was this a freak show?! It looked like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began reading the flyer again, immersed in the drawings and descriptions of the performers. In fact, I was so immersed, I forgot about Mr. Dalton. I only remembered him when I realized the room was silent. I looked up and saw Steve standing alone at the head of the class. He stuck out his tongue at me and grinned. Feeling the hairs on the back of my neck prickle, I stared over my shoulder and there was Mr. Dalton, standing behind me, reading the flyer, lips tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this?\" he snapped, snatching the paper from my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an advertisement, sir,\" I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get it?\" he asked. He looked really angry. I\u0027d never seen him this worked up. \"Where\u0027d you get it?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked my lips nervously. I didn\u0027t know how to answer. I wasn\u0027t going to tell on Alan and I knew he wouldn\u0027t own up by himself: even Alan\u0027s best friends know he\u0027s not the bravest in the world but my mind was stuck in low gear and I couldn\u0027t think of a reasonable lie. Luckily, Steve stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Dalton, it\u0027s mine,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours?\" Mr. Dalton blinked slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found it near the bus stop, sir,\" Steve said. \"Some old guy threw it away. I thought it looked interesting, so I picked it up. I was going to ask you about it later, at the end of class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Mr. Dalton tried not to look flattered but I could tell he was. \"That\u0027s different. Nothing wrong with an inquisitive mind. Sit down, Steve.\" Steve sat. Mr. Dalton stuck a thumbtack on the flyer and pinned it to the bulletin board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long ago,\" he said, tapping the flyer, \"there used to be real freak shows. Greedy con men crammed malformed people in cages and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, what\u0027s malformed mean?\" somebody asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who doesn\u0027t look ordinary,\" Mr. Dalton said. \"A person with three arms or two noses; somebody with no legs; somebody very short or very tall. The con men put these poor people who were no different from you or me, except in looks on display and called them freaks. They charged the public to stare at them, and invited them to laugh and tease. They treated the so-called freaks like animals. Paid them little, beat them, dressed them in rags, never allowed them to wash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s cruel,\" Delaina Price a girl near the front said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"Freak shows were cruel, monstrous creations. That\u0027s why I got angry when I saw this.\" He tore down the flyer. \"They were banned years ago, but every so often you\u0027ll hear a rumor that they\u0027re still going strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think the Cirque Du Freak is a real freak show?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dalton studied the flyer again, then shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it,\" he said. \"Probably just a cruel hoax. Still,\" he added, \"if it was real, I hope nobody here would dream of going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, sir,\" we all said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because freak shows were terrible,\" he said. \"They pretended to be like proper circuses but they were cesspits of evil. Anybody who went to one would be just as bad as the people running it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d have to be really twisted to want to go to one of those,\" Steve agreed. And then he looked at me, winked, and mouthed the words: \"We\u0027re going!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-3.html","bookId":1570,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:54 PM"}
