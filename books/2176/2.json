Mum and Dad are shouting at me, crying, poking and clutching me. Dad gently takes Art from my arms. Mum crouches beside me and hugs me hard, weeping over my bald skull. She\u0027s moaning, calling my name over and over, asking where I\u0027ve been, what happened, if I\u0027m all right. Dad\u0027s staring at me like I\u0027ve got two heads, only looking away to check on Art, his expression one of total bewilderment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no panel of blue light. No monster. And no memory of what happened when I stepped through after the snake-hearted creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learn that I\u0027ve been missing for several days. Mum and Dad thought I\u0027d been kidnapped, or wandered out and got lost. The police have been searching for me. They put my photo in newspapers and questioned all the people who knew me. Mum and Dad were frantic. Mum keeps weeping, saying she thought I was dead, that she\u0027d lost another of her babies. I don\u0027t like the way she refers to me as a baby, but this isn\u0027t the time to correct her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t remember what happened. Up to the moment I took that step forward into the blue light - total recall. After that - nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMum and Dad don\u0027t believe me. They think I\u0027m lying or in shock. They ply me with hot chocolate in our kitchen and quiz me ruthlessly, sometimes gently, sometimes harshly, neither of them in complete control of themselves. They pass Art back and forth, asking me questions about how he ended up with me. I guess he must have gone missing too, after I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I hold Art?\" I ask, during a brief lull in the questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMum passes him to me, watching us suspiciously, perhaps afraid we\u0027ll go missing again. I had a younger sister once - Annabella. She died when she was a baby. I can\u0027t remember much about her - I was only four. But I\u0027ll never forget Mum and Dad\u0027s tears, the misery, the loss I sensed in the air around me. I wasn\u0027t much more than a baby myself, but I knew something terrible had happened, and I could see how upset Mum and Dad were. I guess they never really got over that. It\u0027s only natural that they\u0027re more upset and worried now than most parents would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bounce Art up and down on my knee, cooing to him, telling him everything\u0027s OK. \"You\u0027re my little brother. I\u0027ll look after you. It\u0027s fine.\" He doesn\u0027t take much notice. He looks more sleepy than afraid. Too young to catch the bad vibes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMum and Dad stare at each other wordlessly then leave us alone for a while, going out into the corridor to discuss the situation. They don\u0027t shut the door behind them, and call out to me whenever I stop talking to Art, making sure we\u0027re still here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey let me go to bed at one in the morning. Their faces are strained and red. Mum tucks me in and lets Art sleep beside me. She rubs his face tenderly as she pulls the blanket up around him. Starts to cry again. Dad tugs her away, kisses me, then takes Mum back to their bedroom, leaving me and Art to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake in the middle of the night. Mum and Dad are arguing. I don\u0027t know what about. Mum\u0027s saying, \"Let\u0027s give it a few days. Watch. Wait. If nobody says anything, or looks for him...\" Dad shouts, \"You\u0027re crazy! We can\u0027t! It\u0027s wrong! What if the police...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drift back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning. More questions. Mum sits Art on her lap and feeds him, smiling and laughing wildly every time he gurgles at her. It\u0027s a good job I\u0027m not jealous of my little brother as she hardly notices I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad\u0027s upset. He keeps glaring at Mum and Art. Throws more questions at me. Tries to help me unlock my memories. Asks me to take him through the night I vanished, step by step. I tell him I was in my bedroom, I was playing and that\u0027s all I remember. I don\u0027t mention the lights or the monster. The inner voice that spoke to me that night tells me not to. Says I\u0027d only get into more trouble if I told the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you go to bed?\" Dad asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did someone come into the room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there somebody at the window?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause while I think back. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about... Art? Can you remember where... how you got him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe curses and tugs at his hair with both hands. Looks at Mum and Art again. Mum stares back at him sternly, holding Art against her like a shield. I don\u0027t know what her look means, but I\u0027m glad she\u0027s not looking at me that way - her eyes are scary!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad phones the police and they come round. He sits with me while they ask lots of questions. Mum stays in their bedroom with Art. Dad said there was no need to talk about Art with the police. It would only complicate things. Since Art\u0027s too young to tell them anything, they want to focus on what happened to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell the police the same things I told Mum and Dad. The police are nice. They talk softly, make jokes, tell me stories about other kids who were lost or kidnapped. They want to know if I remember anything, even the smallest detail, but my mind is a complete blank. I keep apologising for not being able to tell them anything more, but they don\u0027t lose patience. They\u0027re much calmer than Mum and Dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t go back to school. Mum and Dad keep me in. Won\u0027t even let me go out to the park. Things feel strange and awkward. It\u0027s like when Annabella died. Lots of crying, sorrow and uncertainty. But it\u0027s different. There\u0027s fear too. Mum\u0027s especially edgy. Hardly lets go of Art. Snaps at Dad a lot of the time. I often find her shaking and crying when she doesn\u0027t think I\u0027ll notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDays pass. The police come back, but they\u0027re not too worried. The most important thing is that I\u0027m safe and back home. They recommend a good psychiatrist to Dad, and suggest he takes me to see her, to try and figure out what happened to me. Dad says he will, but I remember what Mum was like when Miss Tyacke suggested a psychiatrist all those years ago. I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t be going for counselling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night they have a huge row. Mum\u0027s screaming and cursing. I\u0027m in my room with Art. They think we can\u0027t hear them, but we can. I\u0027m scared. I even cry a bit, holding Art tightly, not sure why they\u0027re behaving this way. Art\u0027s not bothered. He gurgles happily in my arms and tries biting a hole through the new bib that Dad bought yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMum yells, \"We\u0027ve been given a second chance! I don\u0027t care how it happened or who gets hurt! I\u0027m not going to suffer the loss of a child again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t hear Dad\u0027s reply, but it seems to do the trick. Mum doesn\u0027t shout after that, though I hear her crying later. I hear Dad crying too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, Dad calls me into his study. He has Art on one knee, a picture of Annabella on the other. He\u0027s looking from Art to the picture and back again, chewing his lower lip. He looks up when I enter and smiles - a thin, shaky smile. Tells me we\u0027re leaving. Immediately, this very night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going on holiday?\" I ask, excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027re moving house.\" Art tugs at Dad\u0027s left ear. Dad ducks his head and chuckles at Art. \"Your Mum doesn\u0027t like it here any more,\" Dad says quietly, not looking at me directly. \"Annabella died here. You went missing. Art... well, she doesn\u0027t want anything else to happen. To Art or to you. She wants to go somewhere safer. To be honest, I do too. I\u0027m sick of city life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about school?\" It\u0027s the first question to pop into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell with it,\" Dad laughs. \"You don\u0027t like it that much, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... no... but it\u0027s my school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find you another.\" He fixes Art in his left arm, then extends his right and pulls me in close. \"I know you haven\u0027t been happy here. Mum and I have been thinking about it. We\u0027re going to move to a place we know, a village called Paskinston. The children will be very different there. Nicer than city kids. We think you\u0027ll be happier, maybe make some friends. And you\u0027ll be safe. We all will. How does that sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I guess. But...\" I shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s for the best, Kernel,\" Dad says and hugs me tight. Art laughs and hugs me too, and that\u0027s when I feel sure that Dad\u0027s right. Everything\u0027s going to be better now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last glimpse of the city is when I get into our car late that night. I don\u0027t know why we don\u0027t wait until morning - Dad hates driving at night - but I haven\u0027t had time to ask. It\u0027s been a rush, packing bags, going through all of my toys, books, comics, clothes, records, choosing what to bring and what to leave behind. Dad says we\u0027ll get the rest of our belongings sent on later, but I don\u0027t want to leave anything precious behind, just in case. I bombed all of the planes in my bedroom at 9 o\u0027clock. Mum and Dad helped me. We destroyed them completely. It was cool! Even Mum enjoyed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we\u0027re getting into the car, Dad asks if I want to play a game with Art, to keep him quiet. I say sure. So he makes me sit on the floor behind Mum\u0027s seat, with Art between my legs, and he drapes a blanket over us. \"Pretend Art and you are fugitives. You\u0027re a pair of vicious, wanted criminals and we\u0027re sneaking you out of the city. There are roadblocks, so you have to hide and be quiet. If you\u0027re found, you\u0027ll be sent to prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Children don\u0027t get sent to prison!\" I snort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do in this game,\" Dad laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0027s just a way for Mum and Dad to keep Art - and me - quiet for some of the journey. But part of me thinks it\u0027s real. The fact that we\u0027re leaving so quickly, at night, in secrecy... I hold Art tight in my arms and whisper for him to be quiet, afraid we\u0027ll be caught by whoever\u0027s after us. I feel like crying, but that\u0027s because we\u0027re leaving home. I\u0027ve never lived anywhere else. It\u0027s scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMum checks that Art and I are OK before getting in the car. She lifts the blanket and peers in at us. We\u0027re parked close to a street light, so I can see her face pretty well. She looks worried - maybe she\u0027s sad to be leaving our old home, like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of your brother,\" she says softly, stroking Art\u0027s left cheek. He gazes at her quietly. \"Protect him,\" Mum says, her voice cracking. Then she kisses my forehead, replaces the blanket and we set off, leaving behind everything I\u0027ve ever known. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-2.html","bookId":2176,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM"}
