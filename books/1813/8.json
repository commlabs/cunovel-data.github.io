Something no one else knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the ceiling. And call forth my deepest, darkest secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have Justin Bieber on my iPod.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggles, “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. That ‘As Long as You Love Me’ song. And if you ever tell the guys, I’ll deny it till the day I die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traces my abs with her fingers. Then I say, “Now you. Tell me something I don’t know yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kisses my chest slowly as she thinks. Then she looks up into my eyes. “Nothing. You know absolutely everything there is to know about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. Then…if you had three wishes, what would you wish for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI once told Kate I wanted to make all her dreams come true. And I didn’t think it was possible at the time, but she means even more to me now than the night I told her that. So if there’s something she wants, something she needs? Heaven and hell better watch their backs—cause I’ll knock both on their asses to get it for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks some more. And when she speaks, her voice is hushed with surprise and gratitude. “I wouldn’t wish for anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, at this moment, I have everything I want. My mother’s happy; I love my work. And anything more I ever would’ve wished for…is right here in front of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard. Hearing that answer? That’s better than a whole sack full of sex toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay—maybe not the riding crop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s definitely close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frame her face with my hands and kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife’s funny, you know? I mean, did you really think a year ago—when Kate and I were going at it, falling through my front door—that we’d ever end up here? At the time, I figured it would be just another one-nighter. Amazing—no question—but still just a fantastic scratch for my long-suffering itch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet here I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonogamous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely, disgustingly infatuated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I couldn’t be happier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is just year one. Not to go all Notebook on you, but Kate and I have a hell of a lot more years ahead of us. A lifetime’s worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I plan on making the most of every f**king one of them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tangled-extra-scenes-tangled-1-1/page-8.html","bookId":1813,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:29 PM"}
