All sects and powers in the Ninth Mountain and Sea would henceforth treat Fang Xiufeng with incredible politeness. After all, Fang Xiufeng now represented the entire Fang Clan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge numbers of Fang Clan cultivators were stationed on Planet South Heaven, and permanent teleportation portals were set up, linking it directly to Planet East Victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also meant that it was no longer just Fang Xiufeng who stood guard over Planet South Heaven. It became the responsibility of the whole Fang Clan, including Fang Shoudao and Fang Yanxu, and no one shirked their duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtect the Mountain and Sea Realm! That... was the oath of the Allheaven Clans!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days after the ceremony was over, Meng Hao bid farewell to his parents and left Planet South Heaven. He wasn\u0027t sure when he would be back in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, so he decided that he should go see some of his old friends before leaving. Some he would visit to reminisce. Others he would visit to collect money!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first stop would be Planet East Victory!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made use of the teleportation portal on Planet South Heaven to travel directly there. On his way to the ancestral mansion, he stopped by the Dao of Alchemy Division to pay respects to Pill Elder and visit some old friends. Then, he and Fang Shoudao opened up the clan’s Ancestral Land!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there looking at the enormous vortex, and the familiar Ancestral Land therein. His heart trembled as he saw the terracotta soldier in the form of a mountain, and couldn’t help but think of Ke Yunhai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad....” he murmured. He stepped forward into the vortex and appeared in front of the terracotta soldier. It was currently sleeping, but as soon as he appeared, its aura awakened, and it slowly opened its eyes. Rumbling echoed out as it rose to its feet, and the power of a Quasi-Dao cultivation base erupted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been waiting this entire time for Meng Hao to come and take it away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day had finally come!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going to take you away,” Meng Hao said. “You’re going to be with me... for all eternity.” He slowly lifted his hand and patted the terracotta soldier as its aura caused memories of Stepdad Ke to swirl in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s another terracotta soldier out there somewhere, and I’m going to get that one back too.” He took a deep breath and then waved his hand. The terracotta soldier instantly transformed into a beam of light that flew into the piece of the Ruins of Immortality that he’d acquired from Paragon Sea Dream!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terracotta soldier had long since become connected inseparably with the Ruins of Immortality, although not the land itself, but its energy. The entire reason it was unable to leave the Fang Clan Ancestral Land was because without that energy, it would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the main reason that Meng Hao requested a piece of the Ruins of Immortality from Paragon Sea Dream. It was all... for the terracotta soldier. As the terracotta soldier entered his own piece of the Ruins of Immortality, Meng Hao’s heart began to beat nervously. After all, his whole plan was based on speculation. However, after seeing that the terracotta soldier showed no signs of being unable to adapt, he breathed a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From now on we’ll... travel together through the Mountain and Sea Realm!” Next, his eyes began to glow as he looked in the direction of the necropolis far off in the distance and bowed. Just as he was about to leave, the ancient voice of the first generation Patriarch echoed out into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The legacy of Lord Li was once on Planet South Heaven. Later it came to Planet East Victory. And now... it’s in the Eighth Mountain and Sea.” As the voice echoed out, a jade slip flew out of the necropolis to appear in front of Meng Hao. He reached out and took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This jade slip shows the current location of the legacy of Lord Li. With this, you should be able to track it down!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The legacy was originally intended for someone in the Dao Realm. However, considering your current cultivation base, you can still... find and acquire the legacy. It... will be of great help to you.” The longer the first generation Patriarch spoke, the weaker his voice got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao sent some divine sense into the jade slip, and could immediately sense something calling to him through the starry sky. It was faint, but he was now sure that if he went looking, he would be able to find the source of that call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he found strange was that the location of Lord Li’s legacy was not fixed within the Eighth Mountain and Sea. Instead, it seemed to be moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Planet South Heaven. Planet East Victory. The Eighth Mountain....” Meng Hao’s eyes widened as he made a sudden, wild speculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way....” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, in the starry sky of the Eighth Mountain and Sea, a gargantuan turtle was flying along happily, humming a little tune, surrounded by hundreds of tough-looking cultivators who were apparently guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they flew along with the turtle, they cried out in loud voices:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Patriarch is mighty, Reliance is mighty!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Patriarch is invincible, Reliance is invincible!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir voices echoed out in powerful sound waves, spreading out in all directions. Any cultivators who encountered them were immediately shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this turtle was none other than Patriarch Reliance, who was now as free as a bird, smacking his lips proudly, looking very much at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Eighth Mountain is way better than the Ninth Mountain. No matter where I look, there’s no Meng Hao. Without him, everything is wonderful.” Patriarch Reliance sighed emotionally as he realized that making the decision to flee from the Ninth Mountain and Sea couldn\u0027t have been more right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That little bastard Meng Hao wouldn’t imagine in his wildest dreams that I’ll never again be fooling around with him in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Finally I can be footloose and fancy free in the Eighth Mountain and Sea.” Patriarch Reliance was very proud of himself, and loved how the cultivators clustered around him and called him mighty. However, it was at this point that he suddenly shivered out of nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eee? What’s going on? Why do I feel so jittery all of a sudden?” A strange look appeared on Patriarch Reliance’s face for a moment, but he thought little more of it and continued on his merry way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, Meng Hao put the jade slip away with a wry expression on his face. Clasping hands to the first generation Patriarch, he then left the Ancestral Land and headed toward the teleportation portal with those speculations running through his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway there, he suddenly turned to find a black-robed cultivator sitting cross-legged on a nearby mountain peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, this cultivator would wear white, but later, he had become the shadow of the clan, and from then on, wore clothing as black as the night, to indicate how he would eternally exist in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Fang Wei!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis location was a place that had to be passed by to get to the teleportation portal, and he had been waiting here specifically for Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir gazes met, and neither said anything at first. A moment passed, and then Meng Hao smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is the meaning of your name, Fang Wei?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor ran through Fang Wei. Meng Hao’s question brought back many memories. A bright glow appeared in his eyes. Voice low and filled with determination, he replied, “That I’m going to defend the Fang Clan!\" [1. In case you forgot, the story of how Fang Wei got his name, and what it means, was in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-6-chapter-998/\"\u003echapter 998\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao waved his finger, which caused Fang Wei to shake one more time. Suddenly, an intense azure light began to shine off of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the light of an Allheaven Immortal. The Dao seed inside of him was now mostly awakened, causing his cultivation base to burn with the power of an imminent breakthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face paled a bit. Smiling, he flew past Fang Wei toward the teleportation portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA complicated expression appeared on Fang Wei’s face as he sensed his surging cultivation base and the Allheaven Immortal energy inside of himself. As Meng Hao made his way off, just before he disappeared, Fang Wei called out, “Meng Hao, I’ll wait for you to get back, and then the two of us are going to fight!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well!” was the echoing reply. Then Meng Hao disappeared into the teleportation portal in a flash of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore,” Fang Wei murmured. “No matter what dangerous situations you run into, make sure to get back safely!” He rose to his feet and headed back in the direction of the Medicine Immortal Sect, eyes gleaming with an unswerving determination to sacrifice anything and everything for the sake of his clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stepped out of a shimmering teleportation portal onto an asteroid field somewhere in the starry sky of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Slapping his bag of holding, he produced a thick stack of promissory notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, who should I go collect money from first? Ah, I guess it doesn’t matter. I have so many promissory notes I guess I might as well just randomly pick one!” Having made up his mind, he pulled a random note out and looked it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taiyang Zi?” he said, smiling. “Not bad, not bad. He owes me quite a few spirit stones.” Face filled with anticipation, he clutched the promissory note in his hand as he shot toward the teleportation portal leading to Mount Sun. As soon as the disciples manning the teleportation portal saw that it was Meng Hao, their faces flickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring them, Meng Hao stepped into the teleportation portal and was surrounded by the glowing light of teleportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reappeared, he found himself in front of a world of scorching heat. It was like a desert, and there was no starry sky up above; this was its own unique, special world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was dark, and the lands were parched. Countless mountains could be seen stretching out in all directions, all of which were spontaneously erupting volcanoes. In fact, in the moment that Meng Hao arrived, he saw a dozen or so of them belching out black smoke, and shooting out bright glowing arcs of light that looked almost like meteors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Mount Sun. According to the legends, it was a fragment of lands shattered by the impact of the Immortal World’s sun when it fell from the heavens. Because it was so large, vast amounts of sun power could be found there, which was also why there were so many powerfully destructive volcanoes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was also why it became a unique location to practice cultivation. Gradually, it came to be called Mount Sun, and after many years, became one of the Five Great Holy Lands of the Ninth Mountain and Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent teleportation portals could be used to get into and out of Mount Sun, and all of them were manned by Mount Sun disciples. Once Meng Hao appeared, they immediately recognized him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Meng Hao!” There were over a hundred disciples in the area of the teleportation portal, and all of them looked at Meng Hao with flickering expressions. Although they weren’t sure why he was here, they immediately pushed down on jade slips to send messages to their superiors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao coughed dryly and glanced around at the Mount Sun disciples, who were acting as though some powerful enemy had just shown up at their doorstep. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he gave them a bashful smile, then cleared his voice and called out, “Taiyang Zi! You owe me money! Time to pay up!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice echoed out like thunder, causing wild colors to flash in Heaven and Earth, and a massive wind to spring up. Boundless ripples emanated out and surged through the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the volcanoes in the area quaked and then erupted, and the sky darkened as the Heavens shook. Everyone in the entire world could hear Meng Hao’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mount Sun disciples stared with wide-open jaws. Mount Sun was immediately thrown into a huge uproar as countless disciples were flabbergasted by Meng Hao\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1195\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1197\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1196","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
