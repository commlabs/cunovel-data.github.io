Is that it?” He waited for an answer. When Perry didn’t give him one, Cinder slid to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the low light, Perry saw that Cinder had dropped his head into his hands. His temper sank, growing cool and dark, until it was a blackness so complete and cold that Perry’s heart began to pound. There was something familiar about it. About a temper like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should’ve just left me. Didn’t you see what I am?” The boy’s voice broke, and then Perry heard soft whimpering sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry swallowed the tight feeling in his throat, keeping still and quiet on the cot as salt mixed with all the scents in the room. Slowly, he told himself. This boy had a rip in him. A wound that ran soul deep. Perry knew what that was like. This would take time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you . . . can you move your fingers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry looked down at his hand. “Not much. But it’ll be easier when the swelling goes down, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinder let out a moan. “I could have killed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I could have! It’s just in me and then it’s out and people get hurt and die and I did it. I don’t want to be like this.” Cinder buried his face as he fell into harsh, raw sobs. “Get out. Please go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry didn’t want to leave him this way, but he was sure of one thing. Cinder was filled with shame. If he stayed there now, Cinder would never look him in the eye again. And he wanted that. He needed to talk to this boy again. Perry slid off the cot onto weary legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would go for now, but he would return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pushed herself out of the deepest sleep she’d ever been in. She blinked until the blurriness cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry sat at the edge of the bed. “I’m here. Marron . . . he said to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he’d gotten there safely. She’d been with Marron when Slate came with the news. But seeing him, she was rocked again by relief. “You took so long. I thought the Croven had gotten you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glinted with amusement. “No wonder you were sleeping so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. When Slate had shown her to the bedroom, she’d only planned to wash her hands and get off her feet until Perry’s hand was treated. But she’d had no hope of staying awake when she saw the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re all right?” she asked. Mud crusted to the side of his jaw. His lips were dry and cracked, but she didn’t see any new injuries. “How’s your hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his arm. A white cast reached from his fingers to his elbow. “It’s soft inside and cool. They gave me some pain medicine, too.” He smiled. “Works better than Luster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Cinder?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry looked down at his cast, his grin fading. “He’s in the medical ward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do they think they can help him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I haven’t said anything about him, and Cinder won’t let anyone near him. I’ll go see him later.” He sighed and rubbed tiredly at his eyes. “I couldn’t leave him out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” she said. She couldn’t either. But she also couldn’t deny the danger in bringing Cinder around other people. He was a boy, but she’d seen what he did to Perry’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry tipped his head to the side. “I gave Marron the Smarteye. He’s working on fixing it. He’ll let us know when there’s news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We made it, ally,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did.” He smiled. It was the lion grin she’d only seen a few times. Sweet and engaging, with a hint of shyness. It showed a whole part of him she didn’t know. Heart pounding, she looked down and saw that they were on the same bed. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed like he’d just noticed the same thing and then his gaze flicked to the door. She didn’t want him to leave. He was finally talking to her without the grit of anger between them. Without any help from Luster or Roar’s easy chatter. She said the first thing that came to mind. “Where’s Roar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened slightly. “Downstairs. I can go get him—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No . . . I just wondered if he’d made it back safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too late. He’d already reached the door. “Not a scratch on him.” He hesitated for a moment. “I’m going to go pass out somewhere,” he said, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few moments, she stared at the spot where he’d been. Why had he hesitated? What had he wanted to say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burrowed back into the warm covers. She was still in her filthy clothes, but she felt the soft pressure of bandages on her feet. Vaguely she remembered answering Slate’s question about her limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lamp on the bedside illuminated soft cream walls. She was in a room, four solid walls around her. It was so quiet. She didn’t hear the rustling wind, or the Croven’s bells, or the sound of her running feet. She looked up and saw a ceiling that was still. Perfectly still. She hadn’t felt this safe since she’d last been with Lumina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed was low to the ground and sleek, but covered in heavy luxurious damask. A Matisse hung on one wall, just a simple sketch of a tree, but the lines brimmed with expression. Her eyes narrowed. Was it a real Matisse? An oriental rug spread autumn colors across the floor. How had Marron collected all of these things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep came, tugging at her again. As she drifted off, she wished for another dream of Lumina. A better one than the last. In this one, she’d sing her mother’s favorite aria. Then Lumina would leave her seat, come up to the stage, and hug Aria close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d be together again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she woke again, she unwrapped the bandages from her feet and headed to an adjoining bathroom, where she showered for the next hour. She almost wept over how good the hot water felt cascading over her tired muscles. Her feet were a mess. Bruised. Blistered. Scabbed. She washed them and wrapped them in towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was surprised to find the bed made when she returned to the bedroom. A small bundle of folded clothing rested on the duvet, along with soft silk slippers. A red rose sat on top of the stack. Aria picked it up gingerly and breathed in the fragrance. Beautiful. Softer than the scent of roses in the Realms. But roses in the Realms didn’t make her heart race. Had Perry remembered her asking about their scent? Was this his answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clothes were pure white, the kind of white she hadn’t seen since she’d left Reverie, and far more fitted than the camos she’d worn for the past week. She pulled them on, noticing the change in the shapes of her legs and calves. She’d grown stronger despite eating such meager amounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a knock at the door. “Come in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young woman entered, dressed in a white doctor’s smock. She was striking, dark and long-limbed, with high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes. A braid wove back from her forehead, ending in a rope that swung in front of her as she knelt by the bed. She set down a steel case and unsnapped the thick buckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Rose,” she said. “I’m one of the doctors here. I’m here to have another look at your feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother look. Rose had already tended to her while she’d slept. Aria sat on the bed as Rose unwrapped the towels. The medical implements in the steel case were modern, similar to what they had in the Pod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We provide medical services,” Rose said, following Aria’s gaze. “It’s one of the ways Marron sustains Delphi. People travel weeks to receive care here. These look much better already. The skin is closing nicely. This will sting for a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this place?” Aria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been many things. Before the Unity it was a mine and then a nuclear shelter. Now it’s one of the only places to live in safety.” Rose’s eyes flicked up. “We avoid trouble with the outside most of the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria couldn’t say anything to that. They had shown up wounded, and with cannibals chasing after them. Rose was right. They hadn’t exactly made a graceful entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched quietly as Rose applied a gel to the bottoms of her feet. A cool, tightening sensation came, followed by relief from pain that had haunted her for a week. Rose pressed a device that resembled a vitals reader to Aria’s wrist. She checked the small screen on the back after it beeped, frowning. “How long have you been out here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eight—I mean ten days,” she answered, adding the two days she’d been unconscious with fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose’s eyebrows lifted in surprise. “You’re dehydrated and undernourished. I’ve never treated a Dweller before, but as far as I can tell you’re otherwise in good health.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shrugged. “I don’t feel like I’m . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t finish the sentence. No one was more surprised than she was about her health. She remembered laying her head on Perry’s satchel early in their odyssey. She’d been so tired and sore to the bone. She still felt that way, like her muscles and her feet needed to heal, but now she had the sense they would heal. She didn’t feel cramps anymore, or headaches, or the grip of illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much longer would her health hold? How long would it take to fix the Smarteye and reach Lumina?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose returned the reader to the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you treat Peregrine?” Aria asked. “Who I came here with?” She could too easily picture the blisters across the solid bones of his knuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did. You’ll heal faster than he will.” She rested her hand on the opened lid, ready to close it. “He’s been here before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria knew she was being baited. “Has he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A year ago. We grew close,” Rose said, leaving no room for misunderstanding. “At least, I thought we did. Scires will do that. They know exactly what to say and how it affects you. They’ll give you what you want, but they won’t give you themselves.” She pushed up her sleeve, showing unmarked skin around her biceps. “Not unless you’re one of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was so . . . open of you,” Aria said. She couldn’t help imagining Perry with her. Beautiful. A handful of years older than Aria and Perry both. She felt her face go hot but couldn’t stop herself from asking the next question. “Do you still love him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose laughed. “It’s probably best if I don’t answer that. I’m married now and with child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stared at Rose’s flat stomach. Was she always this candid? “I don’t know why you’re telling me all of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marron told me to help you so that’s what I’m doing. I knew what I was getting into. I knew it would never work. I think you should know too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for the warning but I’m leaving. Besides, Perry and I are just friends. Even that’s questionable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wanted me to see to you first until he learned you were asleep. He told me you walked a week on those cuts without once moaning about it. I don’t think there’s much question at all.” Rose shut the case with a loud snap, the hint of a smile on her lips. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/under-the-never-sky-under-the-never-sky-1/page-27.html","bookId":1657,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:20 PM"}
