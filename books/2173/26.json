He led them to the heavily guarded side entrance with its express elevator, not wanting to pass Pcharky at this moment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Pcharky was an unnecessary distraction.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He left the escort in the hallway with instructions to get food and rest, signaled for the elevator.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The elevator door was opened by a small Human female of about fifteen years who nodded him into the dim interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie, his natural distrust of even the young on this planet well masked, nevertheless kept her under observation as he accepted the invitation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She was a gamin child with dirty face and hands, a torn grey single garment cut off at the knees.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her very existence as a Dosadi survivor said she\u0027d undoubtedly sold her body many times for scraps of food.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He realized how much Dosadi had influenced him when he found that he couldn\u0027t raise even the slightest feeling of censure at this knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You did what the conditions around you demanded when those conditions were overwhelming.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was an ultimate question:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;this or death?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And certainly some of them chose death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jedrik,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worked her controls and he found himself presently in an unfamiliar hallway.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Two familiar guards stood at a doorway down the hall, however.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They betrayed not the slightest interest in him as he opened the door between them swiftly and strode through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tiny anteroom, empty, but another door directly in front of him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He opened this with more confidence than he felt, entered a larger space full of projection-room gloom with shadowed figures seated facing a holographic focus on his left.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie identified Jedrik by her profile, slipped into a seat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her attention on the h-focus where a projection of Broey stood looking out at something over their shoulders.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie recognized the subtle slippage of computer simulation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was not a flesh-and-blood Broey in the focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone on the far side of the room stood up and crossed to sit beside another figure in the gloom.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie recognized Gar as the man moved through one of the projection beams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie whispered to Jedrik, \"Why simulation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s beginning to do things I didn\u0027t anticipate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suicide missions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie looked at the simulation, wondered why there was no sync-sound.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ahhh, yes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were lip-reading, and it was silent to reduce distractions, to amplify concentration.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, Jedrik was reworking the simulation model of Broey which she carried in her head.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She would also carry another model, even more accurate than the one of Broey, which would give her a certain lead time on the reactions of one Jorj X. McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you really have done it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you distract me with such nonsense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, it was a good question.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He already knew the answer.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She would have done it:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;traded bodies with him and escaped outside the God Wall as McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She might still do it, unless he could anticipate the mechanics of the transfer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, she knew about the sixty-hour limit and would suspect its significance.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Less than sixty hours.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the Dosadi could make extremely complex projections from limited data.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Witness this Broey simulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure in the focus was talking to a fat Human female who held a tube which McKie recognized as a communicator for field use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik spoke across the room to Gar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She still with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addicted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA two-sentence exchange, and it condensed an entire conversation about possible uses of that woman.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie did not ask addicted to what.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There were too many such substances on Dosadi, each with peculiar characteristics, often involving odd monopolies with which everyone seemed familiar.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was a telltale gap in Aritch\u0027s briefings:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the monopolies and their uses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs McKie absorbed the action in the focus, the reasons behind this session became more apparent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey was refusing to believe the report from Havvy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was Havvy in the focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik favored McKie with one flickering glance as Havvy-simulation appeared.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Certainly.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She factored McKie into her computations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie compressed his lips.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She knew Havvy would contaminate me.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They couldn\u0027t say \"I love you\" on this damned planet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Oh, no.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had to create a special Dosadi production number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of the data for this originated before the breakup,\" McKie said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It\u0027s useless.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Rather than ask the computer to play pretty pictures for us, why don\u0027t we examine our own memories?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Surely, somewhere in the combined experiences with Broey . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chuckle somewhere to the left stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, McKie saw that every seat in the room had an arm keyed to the simulations.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were doing precisely what he\u0027d suggested, but in a more sophisticated way.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The figures at the focus were being adjusted to the combined memories.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was such a keyed arm at McKie\u0027s right hand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He suddenly realized how tactless and lecturing he still must appear to these people.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They didn\u0027t waste energy on unnecessary words.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Anyone who did must be subnormal, poorly trained or . . . or not from Dosadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he always state the obvious?\" Gar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie wondered if he\u0027d blown his lieutenancy, lost the opportunity to explore the mystery of the Rim, but . . . no, there wasn\u0027t time for that now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d have to penetrate the Rim another way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s new,\" Jedrik said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"New is not necessarily naive, as you should know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has you doing it now,\" Gar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie put a hand to the simulation controls under his right hand, tested the keys.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had it in a moment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were similar to such devices in the ConSentiency, an adaptation from the DemoPol inputs, no doubt.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Slowly, he changed the Broey at the focus, heavier, the sagging jowls and node wattles of a breeding male Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie froze the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tentative?\" Gar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik answered for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s knowledge he brought here with him.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She did something to her controls, stopped the projection, and raised the room lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie noted that Tria was nowhere in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gowachin have sequestered their females somewhere,\" McKie said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"That somewhere should not be difficult to locate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Send word to Tria that she must not mount her attack on Broey\u0027s corridor just yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why delay?\" Gar demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Broey will have all but evacuated the corridor by now.\" McKie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGar was angry and showing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a single one of them has gone through that Rim gate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to the Rim,\" Jedrik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear to her now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had supplied the leverage she needed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was time now to employ him as she\u0027d always intended.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She glanced at McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have unfinished business.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his silence. How could he answer such a Dosadi-weighted question?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There were so many things left unspoken on this planet, only the native-born could understand them all.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie felt once more that he was a dull outsider, a child of dubious potential among normal adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik arose, looked across at Gar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send word to Tria to hold herself in readiness for another assignment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tell Broey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Call him on an open line.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We now have an excellent use for your fanatics.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If only a few of your people fight through to that Graluz complex, it\u0027ll be enough and Broey will know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie noted that she spoke to Gar with a familiar teaching emphasis.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was the curiously weighted manner she\u0027d once used with McKie, but no longer found necessary.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His recognition of this amused her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come along, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We haven\u0027t much time.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-26.html","bookId":2173,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:19 PM"}
