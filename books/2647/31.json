Usually, they made love first, but the matter Connor had to discuss with her tonight should not wait. When she came to his chamber, he pulled her onto his lap and sat with her before the brazier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw ye speaking with Lachlan outside today.\" This was not what he needed to discuss with her, but the words came out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\" Ilysa\u0027s face lit with a smile that was like a needle in his heart. \"Have ye thought any more about making him captain of your guard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now, I need him to travel around the peninsula gathering information,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he\u0027s going off to look for Hugh\u0027s new camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I told him to do,\" Connor said. \"Who knows if that\u0027s what he\u0027ll actually be doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain he is.\" Ilysa drew her brows together and searched his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought ye didn\u0027t like the idea of me making him captain,\" Connor said, keeping his own gaze on the burning peat logs. \"Ye didn\u0027t trust him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t recall saying that,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ye said was that something troubled Lachlan, and ye wish ye knew what it was.\" Connor turned and fixed his gaze on her face. \"I take it ye found out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlysa fussed with her sleeve and did not respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that ye don\u0027t want to tell me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" she said. \"But it\u0027s no my secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor did not like the idea of Ilysa and closemouthed Lachlan sharing secrets. \"Why would he tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t, precisely. He just gave me a general idea of the sort of secret it was,\" Ilysa said, looking decidedly uncomfortable. \"He thinks Hugh has a spy in the castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Lachlan was the spy, that is exactly what he would say to divert suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now that ye know - in a general sort of way - what troubles Lachlan,\" Connor said, \"what is your opinion of the man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe ye can trust him,\" she said, meeting his gaze dead-on now, \"and that he\u0027s the best choice to be your captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Sorely?\" Connor asked, just because he was feeling sour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye said yourself that Sorely is no good at training the younger men.\" She paused. \"And I don\u0027t like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps if he told ye his troubles like Lachlan does, you\u0027d feel differently about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hurt on Ilysa\u0027s face made Connor regret the words as soon as they were out of his mouth. She removed his arm from around her waist and slid off his lap. Then she stood before him, hands folded in front of her, looking at him with her doe eyes and making him feel like dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are ye speaking to me this way?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ach, I\u0027m sorry.\" Connor went to the window and stared out at the black sea and sky. \"I see ye with Lachlan and know he could give ye all the things I wish I could, and I\u0027m so jealous I can\u0027t think straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Ilysa\u0027s soft steps as she crossed the room to him. He felt the venom go out of him as she put her arms around his waist from behind and leaned against his back. Her kindness was a gift he did not deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk like that,\" she said. \"What could anyone give me that I\u0027d want more than being with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t even give her that for much longer. Though it was true that he had suffered a bout of jealousy when he saw her with Lachlan in a quiet corner of the castle yard, it was the message from MacIain that made his jealousy so sharp that he lashed out at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor turned around to face her. There was no avoiding it any longer. He had to tell her. What would she do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would leave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to bed,\" Ilysa said and took his hand - and he put off telling her a little longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey prepared for bed like he imagined a young married couple would. After helping her off with her gown, he watched her cross the room in her chemise to drape it neatly over a chair. He dropped his own clothes by the bed. He left the candles burning because he liked to see her and crawled in beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he held her to him, he closed his eyes, but he could not prevent the words of the message from blazing across his mind. It would be wrong not to tell her before they made love in case it changed her mind about wanting to be in his bed. But he was tempted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mo chroi.\" He brushed the hair back from her face and kissed her forehead. \"I have news I must tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her body tense in his arms, and she said, \"I don\u0027t want to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Niall brought a message from the MacIain chieftain,\" Connor said. \"He writes that the Crown will look favorably upon a marriage between me and his granddaughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlysa seemed to fold in on herself. Though he understood why she was withdrawing from him, he hated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do ye intend to do?\" she asked in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sought this match,\" Connor made himself say. \"Our clan needs the alliance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had racked his brain since reading the message, trying to think of a way to avoid the marriage. No matter how he looked at it, his clan could not defeat the MacLeods without the help of an ally, and his warriors\u0027 lives would be sacrificed for naught. As chieftain, Connor did not have the right to put his own happiness, or even Ilysa\u0027s, above the lives of his warriors or the recapture of their rightful lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that mean it is settled?\" Ilysa asked, and the slight catch in her voice plucked at his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacIain is on his way now,\" he said. \"He\u0027ll be here in a few days - with his granddaughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the silence stretched out, Connor wished just this once that Ilysa was the sort of lass who yelled and threw things. Anything would be better than this terrible stillness that made him feel as if she were slipping away from him moment by moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no choice,\" he said, \"I must enter into this marriage for the good of the clan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you\u0027re the one I want. Connor did not say the words aloud. He had caused enough harm without begging her to stay and be his lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her methodical way, Ilysa folded the bedclothes back in neat turns and sat up, leaving his arms empty of her warmth. The candlelight picked up gold and red in her hair as she sat on the edge of the bed with her back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If ye want to leave, I\u0027ll send ye home to Dunscaith tomorrow,\" Connor said, though he prayed she would not go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved her so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas her happiness to end this quickly? Connor called Dunscaith her home, but it could never be that without him. She had no home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to do, Connor?\" Ilysa managed to keep her voice calm, though she felt as if her life hung in the balance. It was easier with her back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to do the right thing, if belatedly, by you and by...my future wife,\" he said. \"I swore I would have but one woman as chieftain. If you remain here, I won\u0027t be able to keep that pledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t ask what ye thought was right or what ye feel your duty is,\" she said, speaking carefully. \"I asked what ye want me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want ye to stay here more than anything I\u0027ve ever wanted,\" he said, his voice rough. \"I need ye at my side every day and in my bed each night - but I can\u0027t ask that of ye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlysa swallowed against the surge of emotion that closed her throat. Connor still wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a wife yet,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll stay until ye do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after that? She could feel his unspoken question, but she was not ready to answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor moved to sit behind her, sliding his long legs on either side of hers and wrapping his arms around her in a protective cocoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll cherish every hour we have together,\" he said and kissed the side of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have one condition,\" Ilysa said, remembering Tearlag\u0027s warning. Our chieftain can only find happiness if he weds the lass who chooses him on Beltane night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he asked, his breath warm on her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise ye won\u0027t wed before Beltane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" he asked. \"I doubt there would be time to wed before then, even if I wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had Tearlag not said Connor must wait to find his bride until the summer solstice - or better yet, Lamas, when August arrived warm and golden?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeltane was only a week away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor awoke abruptly and sat up. It was dark, but he sensed morning was not far off. He held very still, listening for the sound again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Ilysa asked in a sleepy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did ye hear that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear what?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not say what precisely had roused him from a deep sleep, but his warrior instincts had been alerted by a sound that should not have been there. He threw back the bedclothes and walked naked to the windows. He peered out into the darkness, looking for movement, first on the sea side and then from the windows overlooking the courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see well enough from here,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going to the tower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the small door at the end of his chamber and ran up the three steps to the tiny tower room. In addition to the ghost who supposedly dwelled here, the tower had a single large window. Connor opened it and leaned out. He heard nothing but the wind and the crash of the waves against the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw them, a line of dark figures coming up the steps. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-chieftain-return-of-the-highlanders-4/page-31.html","bookId":2647,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:09 AM"}
