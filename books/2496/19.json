An interesting idea formed of its own will on a level beyond comprehension. \"You look fine to me. Better than fine. But I did bring you some clothes from your apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed the hair back from her face so that now it was exquisitely framed. He stood up and moved beside her. \"What?\" she asked. Tucker said nothing still, so she asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down and stretched his feet out in front of him, crossing his boots at the ankle. \"I been thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you have, have you? About what?\" Her voice had taken on the ghost of a smile, a coy sort of happiness that he had feared had been erased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve only really ever kissed you when you was dead. Now that you\u0027re alive - well, more or less,\" he winked, \"and there ain\u0027t no one chasing us or trying to kill us, I think I might like to see what it would feel like to kiss you for real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, a real laugh. \"Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but there was this dead girl...\" she let her voice trail off and scooted into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ain\u0027t funny\" He craned his head around to press his lips to hers and they were surprisingly warm and pliant, unlike before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis rational mind wrestled a brief instant with the thought of someone else\u0027s blood coursing through her, but before it could take hold, she pushed him roughly back to the wall and leaned her body into him. With one hand in his hair, she pulled his head back, exposing his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNipping at it playfully, letting the tips of her teeth and tongue tease the skin, she paused long enough to look laughing into his eyes. \"Are you scared?\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She nipped at his cheek and ear. \"Afraid I\u0027ll hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t that. It\u0027s been a long time,\" he whispered hoarsely \"I\u0027m afraid I might be a little quick on the trigger, if you know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ripped his shirt open, ran her burning hands across his chest. His back arched involuntarily. \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be gentle. The first time.\" She raked her nails down the tender skin of his chest, raising welts. He gasped in surprise. She kissed the marks quickly and took his head in both hands to rain kisses on him, kisses that took away his breath and made his heart hammer in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaising herself enough to untangle the shift bunched between her legs, she fumbled at his belt buckle. He slumped almost helplessly as her hands encircled his desire. With her guidance, he entered her and they remained locked there, her atop him, rocking gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his pent-up anxiety and frustration of the last week disappeared in a swirl of pleasure and a physical reaffirming of all the love he held for her. He closed his hands around her waist, the skin as soft as her hot breath in his ear, as he pulled her close again and again. Lizzie trembled in his grasp, twisting and moaning as memories of mortality mixed with heightened responses heretofore unimaginable. A whirlwind of ecstasy ribboned inside her, lifting her to dizzying heights that stretched every sense into a taut, quivering wire of rainbow extremes. The myriad colors stretched tighter and tighter until they snaked around Tucker as well, his wrists, ankles, arms, and eyes. They re wove themselves into a solid arc of joy that arched from one heart to the other and back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime retreated, ashamed at becoming a simple bystander, as they were pulled higher and farther away from all constraints of the physical. The church held them loosely in the arms of sanctity and in that holy silence of bodies joined, love laid its claim on the future. A wave of pleasure crashed over them, so intense it burned like fire, and Tucker melted into her with a groan and she blazed around him, trembling as her body took him deep within. And then it was done. Time rushed heedless into the void that had been created. She fell onto him, and he held her tightly in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last his back started hurting from the position and he pushed her gently to the side. \"Good Lord.\" He thought about it a minute. \"Think it\u0027s sacrilegious to, you know, do it in a church?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think He would mind very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker\u0027s eyes started sliding closed, but he fought against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traced the tips of her fingers against the stubble of his cheek. \"Tucker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched her eyebrow. \"I think I might go grab a bite to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat bolt upright. \"A human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she responded, \"but maybe I could do an animal of some kind, one that would die soon anyway...\" her voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you just have a cigarette or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were trying to help me quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well that was before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that I feel so alive right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well you ain\u0027t,\" he grumbled matter-of-factly, rolled over onto his shoulder and pulled his jacket over him. Rex, who had watched their writhing with typical disdain, curled up against him. \"You\u0027re dead,\" Tucker said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cowboy-and-vampire/page-19.html","bookId":2496,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:41 PM"}
