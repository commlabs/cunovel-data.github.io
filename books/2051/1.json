Blessed with the Beta Male imagination, he spent much of his life squinting into the future so he might spot ways in which the world was conspiring to kill him - him; his wife, Rachel; and now, newborn Sophie. But despite his attention, his paranoia, his ceaseless fretting from the moment Rachel peed a blue stripe on the pregnancy stick to the time they wheeled her into recovery at St. Francis Memorial, Death slipped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not breathing,\" Charlie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s breathing fine,\" Rachel said, patting the baby\u0027s back. \"Do you want to hold her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie had held baby Sophie for a few seconds earlier in the day, and had handed her quickly to a nurse insisting that someone more qualified than he do some finger and toe counting. He\u0027d done it twice and kept coming up with twenty-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They act like that\u0027s all there is to it. Like if the kid has the minimum ten fingers and ten toes it\u0027s all going to be fine. What if there are extras? Huh? Extra-credit fingers? What if the kid has a tail?\" (Charlie was sure he\u0027d spotted a tail in the six-month sonogram. Umbilical indeed! He\u0027d kept a hard copy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t have a tail, Mr. Asher,\" the nurse explained. \"And it\u0027s ten and ten, we\u0027ve all checked. Perhaps you should go home and get some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll still love her, even with her extra finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s perfectly normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or toe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We really do know what we\u0027re doing, Mr. Asher. She\u0027s a beautiful, healthy baby girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a tail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse sighed. She was short, wide, and had a tattoo of a snake up her right calf that showed through her white nurse stockings. She spent four hours of every workday massaging preemie babies, her hands threaded through ports in a Lucite incubator, like she was handling a radioactive spark in there. She talked to them, coaxed them, told them how special they were, and felt their hearts fluttering in chests no bigger than a balled-up pair of sweat socks. She cried over every one, and believed that her tears and touch poured a bit of her own life into the tiny bodies, which was just fine with her. She could spare it. She had been a neonatal nurse for twenty years and had never so much as raised her voice to a new father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no goddamn tail, you doofus! Look!\" She pulled down the blanket and aimed baby Sophie\u0027s bottom at him like she might unleash a fusillade of weapons-grade poopage such as the guileless Beta Male had never seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie jumped back - a lean and nimble thirty, he was - then, once he realized that the baby wasn\u0027t loaded, he straightened the lapels on his tweed jacket in a gesture of righteous indignation. \"You could have removed her tail in the delivery room and we\u0027d never know.\" He didn\u0027t know. He\u0027d been asked to leave the delivery room, first by the ob-gyn and finally by Rachel. (\"Him or me,\" Rachel said. \"One of us has to go.\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rachel\u0027s room, Charlie said: \"If they removed her tail, I want it. She\u0027ll want it when she gets older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sophie, your Papa isn\u0027t really insane. He just hasn\u0027t slept for a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s looking at me,\" Charlie said. \"She\u0027s looking at me like I blew her college money at the track and now she\u0027s going to have to turn tricks to get her MBA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel took his hand. \"Honey, I don\u0027t think her eyes can even focus this early, and besides, she\u0027s a little young to start worrying about her turning tricks to get her MFA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MBA,\" Charlie corrected. \"They start very young these days. By the time I figure out how to get to the track, she could be old enough. God, your parents are going to hate me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that would be different how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New reasons, that\u0027s how. Now I\u0027ve made their granddaughter a shiksa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not a shiksa, Charlie. We\u0027ve been through this. She\u0027s my daughter, so she\u0027s as Jewish as I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie went down on one knee next to the bed and took one of Sophie\u0027s tiny hands between his fingers. \"Daddy\u0027s sorry he made you a shiksa.\" He put his head down, buried his face in the crook where the baby met Rachel\u0027s side. Rachel traced his hairline with her fingernail, describing a tight U-turn around his narrow forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to go home and get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie mumbled something into the covers. When he looked up there were tears in his eyes. \"She feels warm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is warm. She\u0027s supposed to be. It\u0027s a mammal thing. Goes with the breast-feeding. Why are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys are so beautiful.\" He began arranging Rachel\u0027s dark hair across the pillow, brought a long lock down over Sophie\u0027s head, and started styling it into a baby hairpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be okay if she can\u0027t grow hair. There was that angry Irish singer who didn\u0027t have any hair and she was attractive. If we had her tail we could transplant plugs from that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie! Go home!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your parents will blame me. Their bald shiksa granddaughter turning tricks and getting a business degree - it will be all my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel grabbed the buzzer from the blanket and held it up like it was wired to a bomb. \"Charlie, if you don\u0027t go home and get some sleep right now, I swear I\u0027ll buzz the nurse and have her throw you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded stern, but she was smiling. Charlie liked looking at her smile, always had; it felt like approval and permission at the same time. Permission to be Charlie Asher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll go.\" He reached to feel her forehead. \"Do you have a fever? You look tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just gave birth, you squirrel!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just concerned about you.\" He was not a squirrel. She was blaming him for Sophie\u0027s tail, that\u0027s why she\u0027d said squirrel, and not doofus like everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetie, go. Now. So I can get some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie fluffed her pillows, checked her water pitcher, tucked in the blankets, kissed her forehead, kissed the baby\u0027s head, fluffed the baby, then started to rearrange the flowers that his mother had sent, moving the big stargazer lily in the front, accenting it with a spray of baby\u0027s breath -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going. Jeez.\" He checked the room, one last time, then backed toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I bring you anything from home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine. The ready kit you packed covered everything, I think. In fact, I may not even need the fire extinguisher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better to have it and not need it, than to need it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go! I\u0027ll get some rest, the doctor will check Sophie out, and we\u0027ll take her home in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seems soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s standard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I bring more propane for the camp stove?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll try to make it last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel held up the buzzer, as if her demands were not met, the consequences could be dire. \"Love you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love you, too,\" Charlie said. \"Both of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Daddy.\" Rachel puppeted Sophie\u0027s little hand in a wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie felt a lump rising in his throat. No one had ever called him Daddy before, not even a puppet. (He had once asked Rachel, \"Who\u0027s your daddy?\" during sex, to which she had replied, \"Saul Goldstein,\" thus rendering him impotent for a week and raising all kinds of issues that he didn\u0027t really like to think about.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed out of the room, palming the door shut as he went, then headed down the hall and past the desk where the neonatal nurse with the snake tattoo gave him a sideways smile as he went by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie drove a six-year-old minivan that he\u0027d inherited from his father, along with the thrift store and the building that housed it. The minivan always smelled faintly of dust, mothballs, and body odor, despite a forest of smell-good Christmas trees that Charlie had hung from every hook, knob, and protrusion. He opened the car door and the odor of the unwanted - the wares of the thrift-store owner - washed over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he even had the key in the ignition, he noticed the Sarah McLachlan CD lying on the passenger seat. Well, Rachel was going to miss that. It was her favorite CD and there she was, recovering without it, and he could not have that. Charlie grabbed the CD, locked the van, and headed back up to Rachel\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his relief, the nurse had stepped away from the desk so he didn\u0027t have to endure her frosty stare of accusation, or what he guessed would be her frosty stare of accusation. He\u0027d mentally prepared a short speech about how being a good husband and father included anticipating the wants and needs of his wife and that included bringing her music - well, he could use the speech on the way out if she gave him the frosty stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door to Rachel\u0027s room slowly so as not to startle her - anticipating her warm smile of disapproval, but instead she appeared to be asleep and there was a very tall black man dressed in mint green standing next to her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in mint green turned, startled. \"You can see me?\" He gestured to his chocolate-brown tie, and Charlie was reminded, just for a second, of those thin mints they put on the pillow in nicer hotels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I can see you. What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie moved to Rachel\u0027s bedside, putting himself between the stranger and his family. Baby Sophie seemed fascinated by the tall black man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not good,\" said Mint Green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in the wrong room,\" Charlie said. \"You get out of here.\" Charlie reached behind and patted Rachel\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is really, really not good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, my wife is trying to sleep and you\u0027re in the wrong room. Now please go before - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not sleeping,\" said Mint Green. His voice was soft, and a little Southern. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie turned to look down at Rachel, expecting to see her smile, hear her tell him to calm down, but her eyes were closed and her head had lolled off the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey?\" Charlie dropped the CD he was carrying and shook her gently. \"Honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaby Sophie began to cry. Charlie felt Rachel\u0027s forehead, took her by the shoulders, and shook her. \"Honey, wake up. Rachel.\" He put his ear to her heart and heard nothing. \"Nurse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie scrambled across the bed to grab the buzzer that had slipped from Rachel\u0027s hand and lay on the blanket. \"Nurse!\" He pounded the button and turned to look at the man in mint green. \"What happened...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie ran into the hall, but no one was out there. \"Nurse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty seconds later the nurse with the snake tattoo arrived, followed in another thirty seconds by a resuscitation team with a crash cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing they could do. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dirty-job/page-1.html","bookId":2051,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:02 PM"}
