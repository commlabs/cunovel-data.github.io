Sword and chains vanished – yet the three dragons held close in the air above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeering, Tulas Shorn launched himself into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEloth’s voice filled his skull. ‘ Brothers! It is as Cotillion promised! We are freed once more! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Only to die! ’ cried another voice – Ampelas – yet there was nothing of frustration in its tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Should we prevail – Silchas Ruin, will you vow to break our chains? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Silchas replied, ‘ Eloth, I so swear .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Then we have a cause worth fighting for! He bargained true. He is a god with honour! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five Ancient Dragons wheeled then, climbing ever higher as they winged southward. The shadow cast down by one talon slash in the heavens above them marked their path, true as an arrow into the heart of the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ My leg! ’ Telorast shrieked. ‘Curdle! I am crippled! Help me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other skeletal lizard halted so quickly it fell over, rolled once, twice, and then leapt back to its feet. ‘Aaii! See the shadow? It hunts us! It chases us! Webs across the sky! Telorast – you are doomed!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see Eleint! They are coming for us! This was a trap! A lie! A deceit! Betrayal! Bad luck! Help me, Curdle!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurdle leapt up and down as if eating flies on the wing. ‘They only pretended! Those two usurpers – they are venal and vicious, selfish! Not-Apsalar was their servant, was she not? She was! This has been planned from the very start – Telorast, I will weep for you. My sister, my lover, my occasional acquaintance – I promise, I will weep for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You lying bitch! Carry me! Save me! I would save you in your place if I was you and you were me and I wanted to run because that’s the smart thing to do – except when I’m me and you’re you! Then it’s not smart at all!’ She clawed furiously at the ground, one leg kicking, trying to reach Curdle, her small hands clutching the air, her serrated jaws clacking in a manic frenzy. ‘Come closer, I beg you!’ Snap snap snap . ‘I only want to say goodbye, I swear it!’ Snap snap snap snap .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The shadow!’ Curdle shrieked. ‘I’ve waited too long! Help!’ She began running, leaping over tufts of dead grass, dodging boulders and small stones. Her rush startled a grasshopper into the air and she bit it in half in passing. ‘Did you see that? Telor—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth creatures veered. Chains cracked like lightning, lifting them skyward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Storm! Five Ancients – now seven! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Eloth greets you, betrayers! Telorast Anthras! Kerudas Karosias! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Eloth! Ampelas! Kalse! They still hate us! Telorast, look what you’ve done! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorabas, the Otataral Dragon, was being driven earthward as dragon after dragon crashed down on her from above, their talons raking through her hide, flensing her wings. She had killed hundreds, but now, at last, she was failing. The land beneath her loomed, every detail a bitter language of death. She could no longer give voice to her fury, her crushing frustration, and was too exhausted to strike out at the Eleint harrying her on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood streamed down her flanks, rained like acid on the lifeless earth below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summons dragged her forward, but she was blind to its purpose. Perhaps nothing more than a lure. Yet the imperative was absolute and she would strive to answer it. With her last breath, she would seek that fated place. A trap, or a promise? An answer to my prayers, or the making of my barrow? No matter. I fail. I would even welcome chains, but they will not grant me that mercy. I feel Mother awakening. I feel T’iam, so close now – the Storms gathered, the power building. She is coming – she will see me killed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pitched as yet another Eleint slammed down on her. With one last surge, she swung her neck round, lacerated jaws stretching wide—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw seven dragons, descending from high above the swarm surrounding her. Another Storm. This ends it, then .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature clinging to her back tore itself away, flinching from her jaws – she caught a hind limb, ripped the flesh from the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seven Ancients plunged into the maelstrom – and suddenly Eleint were screaming in shock and pain, bodies twisting as they plummeted, blooms of blood like clouds—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fight to save me! But why? Do not draw near, friends! I am poison!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut – more – do not die for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, whose touch is death, beg you – do not die for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet on they fought, but now their foes were recovering, and scores lifted higher to close on them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-426.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
