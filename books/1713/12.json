Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was noon. He was lounging in his third-floor apartment in Sherman Oaks, watching the ball game and waiting for the pizza delivery guy. But to his surprise, the door opened and in walked the best-looking woman he had ever seen in his life. She had elegance written all over her - thirtyish, tall, slim, European clothing, heels that were not too high. Sexy, but in control. Brad sat forward in his lounger chair and ran his hand over his chin, feeling the stubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t expect any visitors - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your uncle, Mr. Watson, sent me,\" the woman said, walking directly toward him. He hastened to stand. \"My name is Maria Gonzales.\" She had a slight accent, but it didn\u0027t sound Spanish. More German. \"I\u0027m involved with the firm that does your uncle\u0027s investment work,\" she said, shaking his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad nodded, inhaling her light perfume. He wasn\u0027t surprised to hear she worked for Uncle Jack: the old guy surrounded himself with good-looking, extremely competent businesswomen. He said, \"What can I do for you, Ms. Gonzales?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing for me,\" she answered smoothly, looking around the apartment for a place to sit. She decided to remain standing. \"But you can do something for your uncle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure. Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need to remind you that your uncle has paid your bail, and will be assuming the cost of your legal defense. Since the charge involves sex with a minor, the defense will be difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was set up - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her hand. \"It\u0027s none of my affair. The point is this: your uncle has helped you many times over the years. Now he needs your help - confidentially - in return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Jack needsmy help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Instrict confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will discuss this with no one. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Understood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word of this must never get out. If it did, you would lose your legal defense funding. You\u0027d spend twenty years in prison as a child molester. You know what that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No screwups this time, Brad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay. Just tell me what you want me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your favorite company, BioGen, is about to announce an important new discovery - a gene that cures drug addiction. It\u0027s the first step toward a huge commercial product, and it will attract a lot of financing. Your uncle currently holds a large position in the company, and he does not want his position diluted by additional investors. He wants them scared off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By some bad news coming out of BioGen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of bad news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the moment,\" Maria Gonzales said, \"BioGen\u0027s most important commercial product consists of a cell line, the Burnet line, which the company bought from UCLA. The cell line produces cytokines, important in cancer treatment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contamination of those cell lines would be disastrous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached into her purse and brought out a small plastic bottle of a well-known brand of eye drops. The bottle contained clear liquid. She unscrewed the cap and put a single drop of liquid on the tip of each finger of her other hand. \"Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One drop on each finger. Let it dry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go into BioGen. Your swipe cards still work. Check the database for storage locations and research lockers containing the Burnet line. The storage number is on this card.\" She handed him a small card with the number BGOX6178990QD. \"There are frozen samples and there are live in-vitro incubators. You go to each one and...just touch them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just touch them?\" Brad looked at the bottle. \"What is that stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing that will hurt you. But the cells won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The security cameras will record me. Card swipes are recorded. They\u0027ll know who did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you go in between one and two a.m. The systems are down for backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they are. This week only.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad took the plastic bottle from her and turned it over in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You realize,\" he said, \"they have off-site storage for that cell line, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do what your uncle asks,\" she said. \"And leave the rest to him.\" She closed her purse. \"And one final thing. Do not call or contact your uncle about this or any other matter. He wants no record ofany contact with you. Clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck. And on behalf of your uncle, thank you.\" She shook his hand again and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO BLONDE EXTINCTION, AFTER ALL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBBC Reported False Story Absent Fact Check\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo WHO Study, No German Study\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Bad Blonde Joke for 150 Years\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe World Health Organization (WHO) today denied it had ever conducted or published any study predicting the extinction of the blonde hair gene. According to the UN group spokesman, \"WHO has no knowledge of how these news reports originated but would like to stress that we have no opinion on the future existence of blondes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to theWashington Post, the BBC story stemmed from a German wire service account. That story, in turn, was based on an article published two years before in the German women\u0027s magazineAllegra, which cited a WHO anthropologist as its source. But no record of the anthropologist exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story would never have run, said Georgetown media professor Len Euler, if even minimal fact-checking had been done by BBC editors. Some media observers noted that news organizations no longer check anything. \"We just publish the press release and move on,\" one reporter observed. Another reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, \"Let\u0027s face it, it\u0027s a good story. Accuracy would kill it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther inquiry by the urban legend site Snopes.com uncovered multiple versions of the extinct blonde story going back 150 years, to the time of Abraham Lincoln. In every instance, scientific validity was claimed to bolster the story\u0027s credibility. A typical example dates from 1906:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e?BLONDES DOOMED TO VANISH FROM EARTH ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor Woodruff Sounds Their Deathknell - It\u0027s Science\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl with the golden tresses is doomed, and within six hundred years blondes will be extinct. The fate of the blonde was foretold today by Major C. E. Woodruff in a lecture at the Association for the Advancement of Science at Columbia University...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, blondes will not become extinct, but neither will the news stories that predict their demise, since the stories have been repeated for a century and a half with no basis whatsoever, said Professor Euler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 034\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Kendall\u0027s wife,Lynn, designed web sites for a living, so she was usually at home during the day. Around three in the afternoon, she got an odd call. \"This is Dr. Marty Roberts at Long Beach Memorial,\" a voice said. \"Is Henry there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s at a soccer game,\" she said. \"Can I take a message?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called his office, and I called his cell, but there was no answer.\" Dr. Roberts\u0027s tone made it sound urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see Henry in an hour,\" Lynn said. \"Is he all right, Dr. Roberts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sure, he\u0027s fine.He\u0027s perfectly fine. Just ask him to call me, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn said she would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when Henry came home, she went into the kitchen, where he was getting cookies and milk for their eight-year-old son, Jamie. Lynn said, \"Do you know somebody at Long Beach Memorial Hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry blinked. \"Did he call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This afternoon. Who is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a friend of mine from school. A pathologist. What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. He wanted you to call him back.\" She somehow managed not to ask her husband what it was all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw Henry glance at the phone in the kitchen, then turn on his heel and walk into the little study that they both shared. He closed the door. She heard him speaking softly on the phone. She couldn\u0027t make out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was eating his snack. Tracy, their thirteen-year-old, was playing her music very loud upstairs. Lynn yelled up the stairwell: \"A little less noise, please!\" Tracy didn\u0027t hear her. There was nothing to do but go upstairs and tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back down, Henry was in the living room, pacing. \"I have to take a trip,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go to Bethesda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something at the NIH?\" The National Institutes of Health were in Bethesda. Henry went there a couple of times a year, for conferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him pace. \"Henry,\" she said, \"are you going to tell me what this is about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just have some research - I just have to check on something - I just - I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go to Bethesda but you\u0027re not sure why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course I\u0027m sure. It\u0027s, um, it\u0027s to do with Bellarmino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Bellarmino was the head of genetics at NIH, and no friend of her husband. \"What about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to, uh, deal with something he has done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down in a chair. \"Henry,\" she said, \"I love you but I am really confused here. Why aren\u0027t you telling me - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it. I just have to go back there, that\u0027s all. Just for a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I don\u0027t want to talk about it, Lynn. I have to go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay...when?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded slowly. \"All right. Do you want me to book - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already done it. I have it handled.\" He stopped pacing and went over to her. \"Look,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t want you to worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s pretty hard, under the circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just something I have to take care of, and then it\u0027ll be taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all he would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn had been marriedto Henry for fifteen years. They had two children together. She knew better than anyone that Henry was prone to nervous tics and flights of fancy. The same imaginative leaps that made him such a good researcher also made him a bit of a hysteric. He was inclined to frequent self-diagnoses of dreaded diseases. He visited his doctor every couple of weeks, and telephoned more often than that. He was plagued by aches, itches, rashes, and sudden fears that woke him in the middle of the night. He dramatized small concerns. A minor accident was a brush with death, the way Henry told it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo even though his behavior about a trip to Bethesda was odd, she was inclined to regard it as probably minor. She glanced at her watch and decided it was time to defrost the spaghetti sauce for dinner. She didn\u0027t want Jamie eating too many cookies or it would spoil his appetite. Tracy had turned her music up louder again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, daily events took over, and pushed Henry and his odd trip from her mind. She had other things to do, and she did them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 035\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Kendallleft Dulles Airport and drove north on 267, heading toward the Primate Facility in Lambertville. It was almost an hour before he saw the chain-link fence and the guardhouse behind the double gates. Beyond the gates he saw huge maple trees that obscured the complex of buildings farther back. Lambertville was one of the largest primate-research facilities in the world, but the National Institutes did not publicize that fact, or its location. Partly because primate research was so politically charged, and partly out of concern for vandalism by activists. Henry pulled up at the outer gate, pushed the button, and said, \"Henry Kendall,\" and gave his code number. He hadn\u0027t been here for four years, but the code was still good. He leaned out of the car so the camera could see his face clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Dr. Kendall.\" The gate opened. He pulled through to the second gate. The first closed behind him. A guard came out and checked his ID. He vaguely remembered the guy. \"Didn\u0027t expect you today, Dr. Kendall.\" He handed him a temporary swipe card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want me to clear out some things from my storage locker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ll bet. Things are getting tighter around here, since, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know.\" He meant Bellarmino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inner gate opened and Henry drove through. He passed the admin building and went straight to the holding facilities. The chimps were formerly in Building B. He assumed they still were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the outer door and swiped his card on the inner door. He went down a corridor to the B Monitor Room. It was a room filled with display screens, showing all the chimpanzees on two floors of the facility. There were about eighty animals of various ages and sexes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe on-duty veterinary assistant was there, in khaki uniform. But also there was Rovak, the head of the facility. He must have been notified by the front gate. Rovak was fifty, steel gray hair, military bearing. But he was a good scientist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wondered when you\u0027d show up,\" Rovak said. He shook hands. He seemed friendly. \"You got the blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Henry nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking Bellarmino had a cow,\" Rovak said. \"He hasn\u0027t been out here yet, and we think we know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Henry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s take a walk,\" Rovak said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry consulted his paper. \"I\u0027m looking for female F-402.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Rovak said. \"You\u0027re looking for the offspring of female F-402. He\u0027s this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started down a side corridor. This led to a small training facility that was used for short-term teaching experiments with animals. \"You keep him here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have to. You\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came into the training facility. At first glance, it looked like a kindergarten play room, brightly colored toys scattered around, blue carpet on the floor. A casual visitor might not notice that the toys were all made of high-impact, durable plastic. There were observation glass walls on one side. Mozart was playing over the speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likes Mozart,\" Rovak said, shrugging. They went into a smaller room, off to the side. A shaft of sunlight came down from the ceiling. There was a five-by-five cage in the center. Inside sat a young chimpanzee, about the size of a four-year-old child. The chimp\u0027s face was flatter than usual, and the skin was pale, but it was clearly a chimp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Dave,\" Rovak said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" the chimp said. His voice was raspy. He turned to Henry. \"Are you my mother?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Kendallcould not speak. His jaw moved, but no words came out. Rovak said, \"Yes, he is, Dave.\" He turned to Kendall. \"His name is Dave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chimp was staring at Henry. Just staring silently, sitting there in the cage, holding his toes in his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s a shock,\" Rovak said. \"Think how people here felt, when they found out. Vet almost passed out. Nobody had any idea he was different until out of the blue; he came up negative on a sialic acid test. They repeated it because they assumed it was an error. But it wasn\u0027t an error. And then he started talking about three months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He speaks well,\" Rovak said. \"Has a little trouble with verb tenses. But nobody has been instructing him. In fact, he\u0027s been kept away from everybody around here. You want to let him out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendall hesitated. \"Is he, uh...\" Chimps could be nasty and aggressive; even small ones might be dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sure, he\u0027s very docile. He\u0027s not a chimp, right?\" He opened the cage. \"Come on out, Dave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave came out hesitantly, like a man released from jail. He seemed frightened to be outside the cage. He looked at Henry. \"Am I going to live with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Henry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out and took Henry\u0027s hand. \"Can we go play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went into the playroom. Dave led.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry said, \"Is this his routine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. He gets about an hour a day. Mostly with the vet. Sometimes me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave went over to the toys and began to arrange them into shapes. A circle, then a square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you came to see him,\" Rovak said. \"I think it\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going to happen to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think? This is illegal as shit, Henry. A transgender higher primate? You know Hitler tried to cross a human and a chimp. And Stalin tried. You might say they defined the field. Let\u0027s see, Hitler, Stalin, and now an American researcher at the NIH? No way, my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This represents an unauthorized experiment. It has to be terminated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in Washington,\" Rovak said, \"and you\u0027re looking at political dynamite. NIH funding is already flat from the current administration. It\u0027d be cut to a tenth, if word of this got out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this animal is extraordinary,\" Henry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But unauthorized. That\u0027s all anybody cares about.\" Rovak shook his head. \"Don\u0027t get sentimental. You have a transgenic experiment that was never authorized and the rules state explicitly that any experiment not approved by the boards will be terminated and there will be no exceptions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you, uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morphine drip intravenously. Won\u0027t feel a thing.\" Rovak said. \"You don\u0027t need to worry. We\u0027ll take good care of him. And after incineration, there will be no evidence at all that it ever happened.\" He nodded to Dave. \"Why don\u0027t you go play with him for a while? He\u0027d like the company. He\u0027s bored with all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey playeda sort of impromptu game of checkers, using toy blocks, jumping over each other while they both sat on the floor. Henry noticed details - Dave\u0027s hands, which were the proportion of human hands; his feet, which were prehensile like a chimp\u0027s; his eyes, which had flecks of blue; and his smile, which was not quite human, not quite ape-like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is fun,\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because you are winning.\" Henry didn\u0027t really understand the rules, but he thought he should let Dave win. That\u0027s what he had done with his own kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he thought,This is my own kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t thinkingclearly, he knew that. He was acting by instinct. He was aware of watching intently as Dave was returned to his cage, of the way he was locked in with a keypress padlock, of the way -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me shake his hand again,\" Henry said. \"Open it up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Rovak said, \"don\u0027t do this to yourself. Or him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to shake his hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRovak sighed, unlocked the lock. Henry watched. 01-05-04.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook Dave\u0027s hand and said good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you coming tomorrow?\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon,\" Henry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave turned away, not looking at him as Henry left the room and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" Rovak said, \"you ought to be grateful you\u0027re not being prosecuted and thrown into jail. Now don\u0027t be foolish about this. We\u0027ll handle it. You go on about your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Henry said. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked to stay at the facility until it was time for his plane home; they put him in a room with a terminal for researchers. He spent the afternoon reading about Dave and all the annotations in his file. He printed the entire file out. He walked around the facility, went to the bathroom several times, so that the guards would be accustomed to seeing him on the monitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRovak went home at four, stopping in to say good-bye on his way out. The vets and guards changed shifts at six. At five-thirty p.m., Henry went back into the training facility and headed straight for Dave\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unlocked the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mother,\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Dave. Would you like to take a trip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Do exactly what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers frequentlywalked with the tamer chimps, sometimes holding their hands. Henry walked with Dave down the training corridor, moving at a casual pace, ignoring the cameras. They turned left into the main corridor and headed for the exterior door. He swiped the inner door, led Dave through, and opened the outer door. As he expected, there were no alarms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lambertville facility had been designed to keep intruders out, and to keep animals from escaping, but not to prevent researchers from removing animals. Indeed, for a variety of reasons, researchers sometimes needed to remove animals without going through extensive red tape. And so it was that Henry put Dave on the floor of the backseat of his car and drove to the exit gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was now shift change, with a lot of cars coming and going. Henry turned in his swipe card and his badge. The guard on duty said, \"Thanks, Dr. Kendall,\" and Henry drove out into the rolling green hills of western Maryland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re driving back?\"Lynn said. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no choice. I have to drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry,\" she said, \"you\u0027re behaving very strangely, you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a moral issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What moral issue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What responsibility? Goddamn it, Henry - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" he said, \"it\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, I want to tell you everything,\" he said, \"I really do. But it\u0027ll have to wait until I get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave said, \"Is that your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn said, \"Who\u0027s in the car with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was talking? That raspy voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really can\u0027t explain it,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll just have to wait until I get home, and then you\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta go, Lynn. Love to the kids.\" He hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave was watching him with patient eyes. \"Was that your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she angry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Are you hungry, Dave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, we\u0027ll find a drive-in. But meantime, you have to wear your seat belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave looked puzzled. Henry pulled over, and clipped the seat belt around him. It didn\u0027t really fit; he was only slightly larger than a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it.\" He started to tug at the harness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to wear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t go back, Dave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave stopped struggling. He stared out the window. \"It\u0027s dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry ran his hand over the animal\u0027s head, feeling the short fur. He could feel Dave relax when he did it. \"It\u0027s okay, Dave. Everything is going to be fine, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry pulled back onto the road, and headed west. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/next/page-12.html","bookId":1713,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:14 AM"}
