The deep cavern around them echoed with the sounds of hammers on wood as the Band did its best to reconstruct the weapons. Talmanes tapped the lantern, judging the oil. It smelled awful when it burned, though he was growing used to that. They had enough for a few more hours yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was good, since—so far as he knew—this cavern had no exits to the battleground above. It was accessible only by gateway. Some Ashaman had known of it. Strange fellow. What kind of man knew of caverns that could not be reached, except through the One Power?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the Band was trapped down here, in a place of safety but isolation. Only rare bits of information came in Mats messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes strained, thinking he could hear the distant sounds of channelers fighting above, but it was mere fancy. The land was silent, and these ancient stones had not seen the light since the Breaking, if then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes shook his head, walking to one of the working teams. \"How goes it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDennel gestured toward a few sheets of paper Aludra had given him, instructions on how to repair this particular dragon. The woman herself gave precise directions to another of the work teams, her lightly accented voice echoing in the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of the tubes are solid\", Dennel said. \"If you think about it, they were built to withstand a little fire and an explosion now and then . . \". He chuckled, then fell silent, looking at Talmanes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not let my expression dampen your good humor\", Talmanes said, tucking his pipe away. \"Nor let it bother you that we are fighting at the end of the world, that our armies are grossly outnumbered, and that if we lose, our very souls will be destroyed by the Dark Lord of all evil\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, my Lord\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a joke\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDennel blinked. \"That?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a joke\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an interesting sense of humor, my Lord\", Dennel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I have been told\". Talmanes stooped down and inspected the dragon cart. The scorched wood was held together with screws and extra boards. \"This does not seem very functional\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will work, my Lord. We won’t be able to move it fast, though. I was saying, the tubes themselves fared well, but the carts . . . Well, we’ve done what we can with salvage and the supplies out of Baerlon, but we can only do so much with the time we have\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is none\", Talmanes said. \"Lord Mat could call upon us at any moment\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they’re still alive up there\", Dennel said, looking upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA discomforting thought. The Band could end its days trapped down here. At least there wouldn’t be many of those days. Either the world would end or the Band would run out of food. They wouldn’t last a week. Buried here. In darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloody ashes, Mat. You’d better not lose up there. You’d better not! The Band still had fight in them. They were not going to end this one starving underground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes held up his lantern, turning to go, but noticed something. The soldiers working on the dragons cast a twisted shadow on the wall, like a man with a wide cloak and hat that obscured his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDennel followed the glance. \"Light. It looks like we’re being watched over by old Jak himself, doesn’t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That it does\", Talmanes said. Then, in a louder voice, he shouted, \"It’s too quiet in here by far! Let’s have some singing, men\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the men paused. Aludra stood up, placing hands on her hips, and gave him a displeased glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Talmanes started it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’ll drink the wine till the cup is dry,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd kiss the girls so they’ll not cry,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd toss the dice until we fly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo dance with Jak o’ the Shadows!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they started it up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’ll give a yell with a bloody curse,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd hug the maids, it could be worse,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we ride away with the Dark One’s purse,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo dance with Jak o’ the Shadows!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir loud voices beat against the stones as they worked, furiously preparing for the part they would play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they would play it. Talmanes would make certain they did. Even if they had to blast their way out of this tomb in a storm of dragonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Olver stabbed the woman in white, Faile’s bonds vanished. She dropped to the ground, stumbling but remaining upright. Mandevwin dropped beside her with a curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAravine. Light, Aravine. Docile, careful and capable. Aravine was a Darkfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the Horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAravine glanced at the fallen Aes Sedai that Olver had attacked, then panicked, grabbing the horse a servant had brought and jumping into the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile dashed for her as captives roared out of the nearby pens, throwing themselves at Trollocs and trying to wrestle weapons free. She had almost reached Aravine before the woman galloped away, carrying the Horn with her. She headed toward the gentler slopes that would allow her to ride to the top of the Heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Faile screamed. \"Aravine! Don’t do this!\" Faile started to run after her, but saw that that was no use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horse. She needed a horse. Faile looked around, frantic, and found the few pack animals they had brought through the gateway. Faile scrambled to Bela’s side, cutting free the saddle—and all of its burdens—with a few swipes of the knife. She leaped up onto the mare bareback and took the reins, then kicked her into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shaggy mare galloped after Aravine, and Faile leaned low on her back. \"Run, Bela\", Faile said. \"If you’ve kept any strength back, now is the time to use it. Please. Run, girl. Run\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBela charged across the trampled ground, hoofbeats accompanying thunder from above. The Trolloc camp was a place of darkness, lit by cook fires and the occasional torch. Faile felt as if she were riding through a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, a few Trollocs burst onto the path to head her off. Faile leaned lower, praying to the Light that they’d miss when they attacked. Bela slowed, and then two horsemen charged up alongside Faile, bearing lances. One pierced a Trollocs neck, and though the other rider missed his mark, his horse shouldered another Trolloc aside, making way. Bela galloped between the disoriented Trollocs, catching up to two men riding ahead, one large of girth, the othe \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-261.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
