A dwarf-like bartender lay a napkin in front of him. \"Que bebe Usted? What are you drinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, thanks,\" Becker replied. \"I need to know if there are any clubs in town for punk rockers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender eyed him strangely. \"Clubs? For punks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Is there anyplace in town where they all hangout?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No lo se, senor. I don\u0027t now. But certainly not here!\" He smiled. \"How about a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker felt like shaking the guy. Nothing was going quite the way he\u0027d planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"?Quiere Vd. algo?\" The bartender repeated. \"?Fino??Jerez?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint strains of classical music were being piped in overhead. Brandenburg Concertos, Becker thought. Number four. He and Susan had seen the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields play the Brandenburgs at the university last year. He suddenly wished she were with him now. The breeze from an overhead air-conditioning vent reminded Becker what it was like outside. He pictured himself walking the sweaty, drugged-out streets of Triana looking for some punk in a British flag T-shirt. He thought of Susan again. \"Zumo de arandano,\" he heard himself say. \"Cranberry juice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender looked baffled. \"Solo?\" Cranberry juice was a popular drink in Spain, but drinking it alone was unheard of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si.\" Becker said. \"Solo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"?Echo un poco de Smirnoff?\" The bartender pressed. \"A splash of vodka?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, gracias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"?Gratis?\" he coaxed. \"On the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the pounding in his head, Becker pictured the filthy streets of Triana, the stifling heat, and the long night ahead of him. What the hell. He nodded. \"Si, echame un poco de vodka.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender seemed much relieved and hustled off to make the drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker glanced around the ornate bar and wondered if he was dreaming. Anything would make more sense than the truth. I\u0027m a university teacher, he thought, on a secret mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender returned with a flourish and presented Becker\u0027s beverage. \"A su gusto, senor. Cranberry with a splash of vodka.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker thanked him. He took a sip and gagged. That\u0027s a splash? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-38.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
