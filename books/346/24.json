{"id":28370,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII TEMPLE THE TEMPTER","content":"\u0026nbsp;“This is my son, James, Mr. Temple,” said the squire, as the young gentleman came in to supper a little late. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Indeed! How old are you, James?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n James took in at a glance the visitor\u0027s appearance, which did not give the impression of prosperity, and answered, with haughty condescension: “I am almost sixteen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I congratulate you, Mr. Leech,” said Temple. “I am not blessed with a son. I would gladly give twenty thousand dollars could I have a son of your boy\u0027s age.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n James pricked up his ears. Temple spoke as if he had the twenty thousand dollars to give. He must be a man of property and so entitled to respect.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What are you going to do with your boy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have not decided. Perhaps he may go to college.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I shall be a lawyer,” said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A good profession. Some of our New York lawyers make great incomes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you live in New York?” asked James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; that is my residence. You must establish yourself in the city when you are ready to practice.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is just what I want to do; I don\u0027t want to bury myself in a one-horse country town like this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And be a one-horse lawyer,” suggested Temple, laughing. “Quite right, my young friend. In the city alone you will find a broad field of action.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s just the way I think,” said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I needn\u0027t say I would do all in my power to push you, and I flatter myself I have some influence.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are very kind, Mr. Temple,” said Mrs. Leech; “but I hoped that James could still continue to live with us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can\u0027t expect me to live at home all my life,” said James, impatiently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps your husband may be persuaded himself to remove to the city,” said Temple. “I really think he stands in his own light in staying in a small place like this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just so,” said James, who would have liked nothing better than to live in New York. “There is no society here. I have no boys to associate with in my own position. Why won\u0027t you move to New York, father?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That requires consideration,” said Squire Leech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should like to talk with you on that subject after supper,” said Temple. “Mrs. Leech, may I ask for another cup of tea?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When supper was over Squire Leech led the way into the sitting room, and his guest followed. The vista of future wealth which his visitor had opened to him had not been without its effect and he began to make inquiries.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose,” he said, “there are ways of investing money to good advantage in New York?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Most certainly—many ways.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Real estate?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That may do, but it is too slow for me. I owned a house uptown. I sold for thirty thousand dollars. In six weeks I made twenty thousand more out of it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it possible?” ejaculated the squire. “Twenty thousand, did you say?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To be sure. Of course that was extra good luck. You can\u0027t expect to do as well often, but there are always ways of turning over capital.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “May I ask in what way you made this large sum?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To be sure. I speculated in Erie. It is all the time fluctuating. I became convinced that it was on the rise. I went in and the event justified my action.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Temple spoke quietly, as if it were no great matter, after all. His host was very much impressed, and felt like a man who has discovered a gold mine. He had succeeded in saving up about two thousand dollars a year for some years; but what was that to twenty thousand dollars made in six weeks? Still, prudence led him to suggest: “But isn\u0027t there danger of losing heavily?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not if you are acquainted with the stock market. It is the ignoramuses that get bit.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know very little of the stock market myself,” confessed Squire Leech. “I own some bank stocks.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No money to be made in bank stocks.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They pay good dividends.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No doubt; but there is little or no variation in value. It\u0027s fluctuation that gives a man a chance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should be as likely to lose as gain, knowing as little as I do of the market.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “True; but I should be happy to place my knowledge at your disposal. As an old friend and schoolmate I naturally feel interested in your prosperity.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are very kind,” said the squire; “but wouldn\u0027t it be too much trouble?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not at all. In fact, it\u0027s my business, and wouldn\u0027t inconvenience me in the least. By the way, how is your property invested?” asked Temple, carelessly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mostly in real estate.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It must pay you very little.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is true. After deducting taxes and repairs, there is very little left.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I supposed. It would pay you to mortgage your property, or sell it, and use the money in Wall Street.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have about twenty thousand dollars in bank stock.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That could readily be sold.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What investments would you suggest?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I couldn\u0027t tell you on the moment; but I think favorably of a mining stock lately put on the market. I have private advices that it is likely to develop extraordinary richness and the stock may even treble in three months.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is the mine?” asked the squire, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Out in Nevada. A friend of mine has just returned from there and he has given me strictly confidential information in regard to it. He has so much faith in it that he has bought fifteen thousand dollars\u0027 worth of shares.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Could I get any?” asked Squire Leech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think you could if you go to work quietly. If you went into the market openly, they would suspect something and raise the price on you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I see. Do you think that is better than Erie?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At present, nothing is to be made in Erie. It is likely to go down before it goes up. The time may come when you can buy to advantage but not now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have a great mind to go up to the city with you, and investigate the matter,” said the squire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do so, by all means. I shall be delighted, and will cheerfully render you all the assistance in my power. But, my friend, let me give you one piece of advice.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say as little as possible to your wife on the subject. Women don\u0027t understand business. They are frightened at risks and don\u0027t understand speculation.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think you are correct,” said his host. “Men must judge for themselves. It is a weak man who would be guided by his wife.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I say. Why, my wife happened to learn that I had gone into Erie on the occasion I mentioned. She remonstrated in great alarm; but when I announced that I had cleared twenty thousand dollars, she had no more to say.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day they went to New York together and within a week the squire had bought largely in the Nevada mine. He subscribed to a financial paper, and was fully embarked on the dangerous sea of speculation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82063.html","bookId":346,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:05:13 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 1:35:42 PM"}
