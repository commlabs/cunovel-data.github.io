I trust you already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m studying Palakon\u0027s nails-pink and smooth and clean. A busboy rolls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea barrel of avocados into the kitchen. Loops of the fall shows repeat themselves endlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I say. \"I still need a DJ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can arrange that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually I already have.\" He pulls out a cell phone and hands it to me. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust stare at it. \"Why don\u0027t you call your associates at the club?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do it, Mr. Ward. Please,\" Palakon says. \"You don\u0027t have much time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flip the cell phone open, punch in my number at the club. JD answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... me,\" I say, scared for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" JD says breathlessly. \"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fashion Cafe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got Junior Vasquez tonight,\" he squeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I\u0027m staring right into Palakon\u0027s face. \"How... did that happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Junior\u0027s manager called Damien and said Junior wants to do it. We\u0027re set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang up the phone and place it slowly, deliberately, on the table. I study Palakon\u0027s face very carefully, thinking a lot of things through, and then I ask him, \"Can you do anything about getting me into Flatliners II?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can talk about that later, Mr. Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also any role where I could play a callow American Eurail traveler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you consider this proposal?\" Palakon asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t sent me any faxes, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What faxes?\" he asks, placing the folder of photos in a thin black briefcase. \"What did they say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027I know who you are and I know what you\u0027re doing.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know who you are, Mr. Johnson, and I already know what you\u0027re doing,\" he says, snapping the briefcase shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa-what are you?\" I ask, vaguely impressed. \"A f**king watchdog?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might say so,\" he sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen.\" I check my watch. \"We\u0027ll, um, talk later, I guess. That\u0027s just too much moola to ignore, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping that you could give me an answer now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, lost. \"You want me to go to London and find some girl I don\u0027t even remember dating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve understood me,\" Palakon says, visibly relieved. \"For a moment there I was worried that nothing was registering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly contemplative, I stare into Palakon\u0027s face. \"You look like the kind of guy who eats his own scabs,\" I murmur. \"Did you know that? That you look like that kind of guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been called many things, Mr. Ward, but a scab-eater has not been among them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, there\u0027s a first time for everything, buddy,\" I sigh, pushing myself away from the table, standing up. Palakon keeps staring at me, which makes me nervous and all tingly, creeps me out in a way I\u0027ve never been creeped out before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, look-it\u0027s Ricki Lake hugging a street urchin.\" I point at a video monitor behind Palakon\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon turns his head to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha-ha-made you look.\" I start walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon stands up. \"Mr. Ward-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I call from across the room. \"I\u0027ve got your card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward, I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll talk to you later, man. Peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant is still totally deserted. I can\u0027t even see Byana or Jasmine or the waitress I ordered the ice beer from anywhere. When I reach my bike someone\u0027s stuck a giant fax on one of the handlebars: I KNOW WHAT YOU\u0027RE DOING AND I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID. I grab it and run back into the soft light of the main room to show Palakon, but that room, too, is empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show\u0027s at Bryant Park even though it was supposed to be in an abandoned synagogue on Norfolk Street but Todd freaked when he heard it was haunted by the ghosts of two feuding rabbis and a giant floating knish and as I roll up to the back entrance-42nd Street jammed with TV vans and satellite dishes and limousines and black sedans-photographers have already lined up, calling out my name as I flash my pass at the security guards. Behind barricades groups of teenagers shout out for Madonna even though she\u0027s not expected to show because she\u0027s too busy facing down her latest stalker in court but Guy from Maverick Records promised to appear and Elsa Klensch and a CNN camera crew\u0027s interviewing FIT students about their favorite designers and just an hour ago the runway was shortened because of the supposed overflow of five hundred and there was a desperate need to add room for the three hundred standees. Video monitors have been set up outside for the overflow\u0027s overflow. The show cost $350,000 to put on so everyone needs to see it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-60.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
