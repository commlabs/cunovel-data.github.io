We\u0027re just employees. The police of the Twilight world. What I say goes for the Night Watch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But who are they?\u0027 The kid was beginning to accept it. \u0027Magicians?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, but highly specialised ones.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiger Cub appeared below me on the bend of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hi there, guys!\u0027 she exclaimed cheerfully, bounding up an entire flight in a single leap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a superhuman leap. Egor flinched and took a step back, staring watchfully at Tiger Cub. I shook my head: she was clearly poised on the very edge of transformation. She was enjoying it, and just at that moment she had good reason to be feeling frisky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How are things over there?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiger Cub sighed loudly and then smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh ... a laugh a minute. Everybody\u0027s in a panic. You get going, Antoshka, they\u0027re waiting for you ... So it\u0027s you I\u0027m looking after, right?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy looked her over without saying anything. To be honest, the boss had made a great choice when he decided to get Tiger Cub to protect Egor. Everyone, from young children to old people, liked her and trusted her. They do say even some of the Dark Ones have sometimes been charmed by her. But then, that was their mistake . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No one\u0027s looking after me,\u0027 the boy answered at last. \u0027My name\u0027s Egor.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And I\u0027m Tiger Cub,\u0027 said the girl, already inside the apartment. She gave the boy a friendly hug round the shoulders. \u0027Show me round the battlefield! Let\u0027s start preparing our defences!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started down the stairs, shaking my head as I went. In five minutes Tiger Cub would be showing Egor how she got her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hello,\u0027 Bear rumbled as he walked up towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hi.\u0027 We shook hands quickly. Of all the Watch agents, Bear was the one I had the most mixed feelings about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear was a little bit taller than average, strongly built with a face that gave nothing away. He didn\u0027t like to talk a lot. Nobody knew where he spent his time when he wasn\u0027t working, or where he lived, except maybe Tiger Cub. There were rumours that he wasn\u0027t even a magician, but a shape-shifter. They said that first he used to work for the Day Watch and then, during some mission, he suddenly switched over to our side. But that was all a load of nonsense. Light Ones don\u0027t become Dark Ones, and Dark Ones don\u0027t turn into Light Ones. But there was something about Bear that made you stop and wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Your car\u0027s waiting,\u0027 the field agent told me without bothering to stop. \u0027The driver\u0027s a real pro. You\u0027ll be there before you know it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear had a slight stammer, so he kept his sentences short. He was in no hurry, Tiger Cub was already on guard. But I had no time to hang around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are things tough over there?\u0027 I asked, walking faster. The answer came from above me now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Worse than that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bounded down several steps at a time and belted out of the entrance. The car was there all right – I slowed down for a moment to admire it. A classy maroon BMW, the latest model, with a flashing light carelessly stuck on the roof. Both doors on the side facing the building were open. The driver was leaning out of the car, hastily smoking a cigarette, and I could just make out the bulge of a holster beneath his jacket. Standing by the back door was an absolutely monumental middle-aged man. Under his open coat he was wearing a very expensive suit, with a Duma deputy\u0027s badge glinting on his lapel. The man was speaking on his mobile:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who is he anyway? I\u0027ll get there when I can! What? What damned girls? Have you gone crazy? Can\u0027t you do a single thing on your own?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing me, the deputy narrowed his eyes, cut short his conversation without saying goodbye and got into the car. The driver took a deep drag, tossed his cigarette away and took hold of the wheel. The engine howled softly and I barely had time to get into the front seat before the car moved away. Icy branches scraped across the outside of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You gone blind, or something?\u0027 the deputy barked at his driver, though I was the one to blame for what had happened. But as soon as the owner of the car turned to face me his tone changed: \u0027You need to get to Perovo?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time I\u0027d ever taken a ride with a representative of authority. And this guy was either a top man in the militia or a gangland boss. I realised in theory that there was no difference as far as a Night Watch agent\u0027s powers were concerned, but I\u0027d never tried to experiment before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, back to where the guys came from. And make it quick . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hear that, Volodya?\u0027 the deputy said to the driver. \u0027Step on it!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolodya stepped on it so hard I started feeling a bit queasy and I even glanced into the Twilight to see if we were going to get there in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like we were. Only not just because of our driver\u0027s skill or because, like any Night Watch agent, I have an artificially elevated success coefficient. It looked like someone had gone through the probability field, weeding out all the accidents, tailbacks and overzealous traffic cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only person in our department who could have done that was the boss himself. But what for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m feeling a bit frightened too,\u0027 whispered the invisible bird on my shoulder. \u0027When I was with Count—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped short, as if she\u0027d realised she was speaking a bit too freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car drove through a red light at an intersection, following an incredible twisting route, dodging between the saloons and station wagons. Someone at a bus stop waved a hand in our direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like a sip?\u0027 the Duma deputy enquired amiably, holding out a small bottle of Remy Martin and a plastic cup. It seemed so bizarre, I poured myself thirty grams without even thinking about it. Even at that speed the car was a smooth ride, and the cognac didn\u0027t spill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed back the bottle, nodded, took the walkman earphones out of my pocket, put them on and clicked play. Out came this ancient song, \u0027Sundays\u0027 – my favourite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a small town, no bigger than a child\u0027s toy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d been no plagues or invasions there since long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cannon rusted in silence on its fortress tower,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the travellers\u0027 roads passed it by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so year after year, no holidays or work days –\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole town slept,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreaming dreams of lands with empty cities\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd dead cliffs . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe emerged on to the main highway. The car just kept on picking up speed, I\u0027d never travelled that fast in Moscow before. Or anywhere else, come to that ... If the probability field hadn\u0027t been cleared, I\u0027d have made them slow down, but it was pretty terrifying anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music sounded among the cold cliffs,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the town slept. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling to where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling to whom?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat no one knew . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help remembering that Romanov was an Other. Only he wasn\u0027t initiated, he\u0027d been spotted too late . . . They\u0027d offered him the chance, but he\u0027d refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s one option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how often he heard this music in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll who left their windows open in the hot night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre gone now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGone away to seek a land where life is full of life,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the song . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like some more?\u0027 The deputy was Mr Conviviality in person. I wondered what suggestions Bear and Tiger Cub had implanted in his mind. That I was his best friend? That he was eternally in my debt? That I was the president\u0027s illegitimate but favourite son?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0027s all rubbish. There are hundreds of different ways of making people trust you and like you and want to help you. The Light has its own methods, but unfortunately the Dark has plenty as well. It\u0027s all rubbish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was: what did the boss need me for so badly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eILYA WAS waiting for me beside the road, standing there with his hands stuck in his pockets, staring up in disgust at the sky through a flurry of fine snowflakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You took your time,\u0027 was all he said after I\u0027d shaken the deputy\u0027s hand and got out of the car. \u0027The boss is getting impatient.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlya grinned, but it wasn\u0027t his usual cheerful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ll see . . . let\u0027s go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set off along a trampled path, overtaking women with shopping bags rambling home from the supermarket. How strange it is that we have supermarkets now, just like the real things. But people still walk the same old tired way, as if they\u0027d spent an hour standing in line for little blue corpses described as chickens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it far?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If it was, we\u0027d have taken a car.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How did our sexual giant make out? Couldn\u0027t he handle it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ignat tried his best,\u0027 was all Ilya said. I felt a brief pang of vengeful satisfaction, as if it were in my interests for handsome Ignat to screw up. If a mission required it, he was usually in someone else\u0027s bed within two hours of being given his assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The boss has declared a state of readiness for evacuation,\u0027 Ilya suddenly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027At a moment\u0027s notice. If the vortex isn\u0027t stabilised, the Others quit Moscow.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was walking ahead of me, I couldn\u0027t look into his eyes. But what reason would Ilya have to lie?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And is the vortex still . . .\u0027 I began. Then I stopped. I could see in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the dismal nine-storey block facing us, a black tornado was revolving slowly against the background of the dark, snowy sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou couldn\u0027t call it a twister or a vortex any longer. It was a tornado. It rose up out of the next building along, hidden by the one we could see. And judging from the side-angle of the dark cone, it went almost down to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Damn . . .\u0027 I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Watch what you say,\u0027 Ilya snapped. \u0027It could easily come true.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s thirty metres high. . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thirty-two. And still growing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast a hasty glance at my shoulder and saw Olga sitting there. She\u0027d emerged from the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever seen a bird frightened? Frightened like a human?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl looked ruffled. Can feathers really stand on end? There was an orange-yellow flame blazing in her amber eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shoulder of my poor jacket was torn into tiny shreds, and the claws carried on scraping, as if they wanted to scrape right through to my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olga!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now you see . . . The boss says the vortex at Hiroshima wasn\u0027t that high.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl flapped its wings and soared smoothly into the air, without a sound. A woman shrieked behind me – I swung round and saw a stupefied face, glazed eyes following the bird\u0027s flight in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a crow,\u0027 Ilya said quietly, half turning his head to glance at the woman. His reactions were far quicker than mine. A moment later the accidental witness was overtaking us, muttering about the narrow path and people who liked to block the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it growing fast?\u0027 I asked, with a nod at the tornado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027In bursts. But it\u0027s stabilising now. The boss called Ignat off just in time.
