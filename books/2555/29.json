{"id":111974,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock and Lizzie, Harry and the kids are sitting in the living room. There\u0027s something happening outside. The others haven\u0027t noticed yet. I don\u0027t want the children and Liz getting upset again so I haven\u0027t said anything to anyone. It started about half an hour ago. I\u0027ve heard heavy vehicles moving in the distance and the occasional scream or shout. I\u0027ve also heard gunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve tried looking through every window in the flat but I can\u0027t see what\u0027s going on out there. I have to know. I make sure the others are all distracted then creep out of the apartment. I stop halfway across the lobby. Everything looks just as it did when I was out here yesterday but today the building feels different because of what\u0027s upstairs. I stop at the bottom of the staircase and, just for a second, I think about turning round and going back into the flat again. I\u0027ll get a better view from the flats on the other floors but I\u0027m worried about going upstairs. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone else up there - the car belonging to the people on the top floor is still missing and I can\u0027t hear anything. But what about the body? I know the man on the landing is dead but have I got the balls to pass his corpse? My head is suddenly filled with stupid nightmare images of his lifeless hands reaching out to grab me. The sound of another gun shot in the distance spurs me into action. I take a deep breath and run up the stairs, not stopping until I\u0027ve reached the flat on the top floor. I peer in through the half-open door to make sure it\u0027s still empty then step inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are only two floors between our flat and this one but the view from up here is completely different. Those extra few feet of height make all the difference and from here I can see for miles around. I can see almost all of our estate and I can see the city centre in the distance. This morning the world looks like the TV footage that gets sent home by war correspondents. The skyline is dark and grey. Dirty, thick smoke is climbing from the blackened shells of burnt-out buildings. There\u0027s nothing much left of the medical centre on Colville Way. The streets are deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow am I supposed to protect my family from this? I can sense the danger increasing almost by the second and there\u0027s nothing I can do to stop it. I think of the kids downstairs and I feel terrified and helpless. They\u0027re depending on me and I don\u0027t know what I can do to keep them safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see movement in the distance now. Can\u0027t see exactly what it is from here. I turn around and grab the video camera I saw when I was up here yesterday. Christ knows what the men who lived here used it for. I\u0027ve got no interest in finding out. I take the camera over to the window and switch it on. There\u0027s hardly any battery power left. I find the zoom lens control and set it so that it\u0027s focussed as far as possible into the distance. It takes me a few seconds to aim the camera in the right direction and to relocate the movement I\u0027ve just seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027m looking at the area around Marsh Way but I\u0027m not sure. Whatever the name of the road I\u0027m watching is, there are two large green-grey trucks driving along it. On either side of the trucks are lines of uniformed figures. Bloody hell, they\u0027re armed soldiers wearing what looks like full battle gear. They have masks or visors obscuring their faces. The trucks stop mid-way along the street and the guards which surround them split into smaller groups. Some remain close to the back of the vehicles while others move towards the houses on either side of the road. From here I can only see one group of figures clearly but I guess they\u0027re all doing the same thing. It looks like a house-to-house inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trooper at the front of the group hammers his fist on the door. Christ, they\u0027re not waiting to be invited inside. Four of the soldiers in the group of five force their way into the house as soon as the door is opened. The fifth uniformed figure follows them inside carrying something. It\u0027s difficult to keep the camera focussed from this distance and I can\u0027t tell whether it\u0027s a clipboard or one of those tablet computer things he\u0027s holding. They all disappear into the building and I wait for them to re-emerge. And I wait. And I wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElsewhere along the street the same thing is happening. Groups of soldiers are splintering away from the trucks and are checking each house in turn. I look up from the video camera viewfinder screen for a second and catch sight of more movement in another road nearby. Same thing\u0027s happening again. I squint as the sun breaks through the heavy cloud for the first time today and I can see at least two more clusters of trucks and soldiers working their way along other streets, all within a few hundred meters radius of each other. I focus back on the house I was originally watching in Marsh Way as the five soldiers march back out and immediately turn their attention to the building next door, leaving a dazed and bewildered middle-aged couple to timidly close their front door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are helicopters flying over the town. Strange. Maybe they\u0027re coordinating the movements of the troops on the ground?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers I\u0027ve been watching have forced their way into another house now. They reappear in less than a minute, this time dragging someone behind them. I can\u0027t make out whether it\u0027s a man or a woman but they\u0027re kicking and punching and doing all they can to get away. I can see that it\u0027s a woman now. She\u0027s only half-dressed. They\u0027ve turned her around and they\u0027re marching her towards the nearest truck. She\u0027s still fighting. As they push her towards the back of the vehicle she somehow manages to free herself from the soldiers\u0027 hold. She starts to run down the road and... and now I can\u0027t believe what I\u0027m seeing. One of the soldiers steps forward and raises his rifle. Instead of chasing after her he simply shoots her in the back. Two of them pick up the fallen body and throw it unceremoniously into the back of one of the trucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey must finally be flushing out the Haters. Thank God for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s about time. I hope the bastards get everything they deserve. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-29.html","bookId":2555,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM"}
