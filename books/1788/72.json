He, who had always congratulated himself on his equanimity, was instantly overrun with hostility. \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"you should have asked first. As it turns out, your services aren\u0027t needed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrost\u0027s face darkened. \"What gives you the right to speak for Miss Hathaway and her family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam saw no reason to be discreet. \"I\u0027m going to marry her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrost nearly dropped the iron bar. \"Don\u0027t be absurd. Amelia would never marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good God,\" Frost exclaimed incredulously, \"how can you ask that? You\u0027re not a gentleman of her class, and... hell and damnation, you\u0027re not even a real Gypsy. You\u0027re a mongrel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same, I\u0027m going to marry her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you in hell first!\" Frost cried, taking a step toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either drop that bar,\" Cam said quietly, \"or I\u0027ll dislocate your arm.\" He sincerely hoped Frost would take a swing at him. To his disappointment, Frost set the bar on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe architect glared at him. \"After I talk to her, she\u0027ll want nothing more to do with you. I\u0027ll make certain she understands what people would say about a lady who beds down with a Gypsy. She\u0027d be better off with a peasant. A dog. A?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Point taken,\" Cam said. He gave Frost a bland smile designed to infuriate. \"But it\u0027s interesting, isn\u0027t it, that Miss Hathaway\u0027s previous experience with a gentleman of her own class has now disposed her to look favorably on a Roma? It hardly reflects well on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You selfish bastard,\" Frost muttered. \"You\u0027ll ruin her. You think nothing of bringing her down to your level. If you cared for her at all, you would disappear for good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed by Cam without another word. Soon his footsteps could be heard as he descended the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Cam stayed in the empty doorway for a long time, seething with anger, concern for Amelia, and even worse, guilt. He couldn\u0027t change the fact of what he was, nor would he be able to shield Amelia from all the arrows that would be aimed at the wife of a Gypsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he would be damned if he would let her make her way through a merciless world without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupper was a somber affair, with the Westcliffs and St. Vincents having departed for Bristol, and Leo having gone to the village tavern for amusement. It was a miserable night. Amelia found it hard to imagine there would be much revelry in the cold and wet, but Leo was probably desperate for more sympathetic company than could be found at Stony Cross Manor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen had remained in his room, sleeping most of the day, which was so unlike him that the Hathaways were all worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it\u0027s good for him to rest,\" Poppy ventured, brushing idly at a few crumbs on the tablecloth. A footman came hurriedly to remove the crumbs for her with a napkin and silver implement. \"It will help him to heal faster, won\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has anyone had a look at Merripen\u0027s shoulder?\" Amelia asked, glancing at Win. \"It\u0027s probably time for the dressing to be changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" Win said at once. \"And I\u0027ll take up a supper tray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beatrix will accompany you,\" Amelia advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can manage the tray,\" Win protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that... I meant it\u0027s not proper for you to be alone with Merripen in his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin looked surprised, and made a face. \"I don\u0027t need Beatrix to come. It\u0027s only Merripen, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Win left the dining hall, Poppy looked at Amelia. \"Do you think that Win really doesn\u0027t know how he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea. And I\u0027ve never dared to broach the subject, because I don\u0027t want to put ideas into her head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope she doesn\u0027t know,\" Beatrix ventured. \"It would be dreadfully sad if she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia and Poppy both glanced at their younger sister quizzically. \"Do you know what we\u0027re talking about, Bea?\" Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. Merripen\u0027s in love with her. I knew it a long time ago, from the way he washed her window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Washed her window?\" both older sisters asked at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, when we lived in the cottage at Primrose Place. Win\u0027s room had a casement window that looked out onto the big maple treeâ€”do you remember? After the scarlet fever, when Win couldn\u0027t get out of bed for the longest time and she was too weak to hold a book, she would just lie there and watch a birds\u0027 nest on one of the tree limbs. She saw the baby swallows hatch and learn to fly. One day she complained that the window was so dirty, she could barely see through it, and it made the sky look grayish. So from then on Merripen always kept the glass spotless. Sometimes he climbed a ladder to wash the outside, and you know how afraid of heights he is. You never saw him do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Amelia said with difficulty, her eyes stinging. \"I didn\u0027t know he did that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merripen said the sky should always be blue for her,\" Beatrix said. \"And that was when I knew he... are you crying, Poppy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy used a napkin to dab at the comers of her eyes. \"No. I just inhaled some pepper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did I,\" Amelia said, blowing her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin carried a light bamboo tray laden with broth, bread, and tea to Merripen\u0027s room. It hadn\u0027t been easy to persuade the kitchen maids that she could take the tray herself. They had felt strongly that no guest of Lord and Lady Westcliff\u0027s should carry anything. However, Win knew Merripen\u0027s dislike of strangers, and in his vulnerable state, he would be contrary and obstinate. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-72.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
