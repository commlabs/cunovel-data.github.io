But it didn\u0027t, try as it might. Instead it tugged and pulled at me like an angry thing, as I remained seated and focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were closed tight; my hands rested on my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind thundered over my exposed ears. Yes, my hood was down. I didn\u0027t want any barrier between me and God. I breathed in and out, slowly. Now, the wind blew even harder, rocking me further and, in the far distance, I heard the pounding of the surf against the rock cliffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued breathing, slowly, deliberately, deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a minute or two of focused concentration, but soon enough, I felt a sensation of rising up, as if I\u0027d entered a tube of some sort. A glass tube, because in my mind\u0027s eye I could see myself rising up. But, interestingly, not so much rising above the earth. No. Instead, I sensed myself rising up through what appeared to be levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I knew this, I didn\u0027t know. But the word felt right. Yes, I was rising up through the dimensions, even as the rain hit me full in the face. The sensation of being wet and cold seemed to be happening to someone else. Certainly not me...after all, I was rising, rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimensions swept past me. On many of them I sensed entities, or beings, watching me, observing me while I came and went. Spiritual beings, I knew, highly evolved beings that existed in realms that we, as humans, could not comprehend...and yet, I sped past even them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher and higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was back. Not above the Earth, or even above the Universe. I was outside of the Universe. Outside of space and time. I was observing creation as God would have. As God did so now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome back, Samantha Moon, came a thought deep inside my head. No, not exactly in my head. All around me, vibrating through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed that I existed in the space between space, and it was a concept that was difficult for me to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are doing fine, Samantha Moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you. You are doing fine, too, from what I can gather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gentle laugh inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of you to say, Sam. Do you mind if I call you Sam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re God, you can call me anything you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore gentle laughter. God, I was discovering, had a nice sense of humor. I understand that you think that, Sam. But I am, more accurately, the Source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Source of life in this universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see, I thought. I think. That\u0027s still pretty much God to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not argue the point, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it\u0027s a pleasure to have your company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed the vastness, the emptiness, the peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you ever feel lonely out here? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour question implies that I might find myself alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, yes, I guess. Are there many others like you? Other Sources?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a handful of us, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve, to be exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd from where do the twelve originate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly that, Sam. From the Origin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what, exactly, is the Origin? My Creator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see, I thought. And you are my Creator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are my creation, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what do the other twelve Sources do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watch over their own multiverses, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. And why did the Origin create twelve of you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why did you create me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that I can learn more about myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus, what? Report back to the Origin? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are correct, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about this as the rain and wind pummeled my physical body a universe away, as I gazed out over the slowly-moving cosmos that rotated around a galactic center of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s pretty heavy, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s as heavy or light as you want it to be. But, yes, I understand that these are new concepts for you in the physical world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there evil? I asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is the potential for others to show you the opposite of light, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a sudden insight, sudden clarity. I wondered if this insight came from the Source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness is necessary to appreciate the light, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell said, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan darkness ever destroy light?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight pause before the voice vibrated through my being again: Remember this always, Sam: A small match can illuminate the darkest room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the meaning and felt myself nod way, way back there on that rock dome, high above Skull Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I should never fear darkness, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLive in light, Samantha, but acknowledge the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor without darkness, there cannot be light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery good, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there a Devil? I asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause. You are asking if there is an entity that delights in causing mischief, who tortures souls for all eternity, who causes the good to falter, and the bad to be worse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Sam. No such entity exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Perhaps here in space, or perhaps back on the dome, I said, I have a question about a group of beings I have come across, one such being is, in fact, residing within me, and undoubtedly hearing this very conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she needs to hear this conversation, Samantha. Maybe you are her answer, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you are her way back to the life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never thought of that. I paused, formulating my thoughts. I feel she is evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe - and others like her - have certainly made choices that might appear evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they are not evil? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey operate out of fear, Sam. Fear of moving on, fear of giving up power, fear of retribution. They are, quite simply, misinformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMisinformed about what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat life is eternal, that I am eternal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat they are eternal. That power is temporary, that love is everlasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning flashed in the heavens above...until I realized that it had flashed directly above my body. I was about to ask another question, until I felt myself slipping back...or down through the dimensions. As I slipped down, down, God\u0027s words sang through me and around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove is everlasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes and looked out over stormy seas and wondered again if I\u0027d completely lost my mind. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-34.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
