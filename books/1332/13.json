In front of it, the 3rd and 9th German Corps were quartered. On learning that violent fighting was going on on the Sambre and in the direction of Mons, a sortie was decided upon for the 25th and 26th of August. The 6th Division took Hofstade and the Schiplaeken Woods. The 1st and 5th Divisions took Sempst, Weerde, and Eppeghem; but, on the left wing, the 2nd Division could not gain the left bank of the Louvain canal and, in the centre, the 6th Division could not occupy Elewyt. The army, therefore, returned to the retrenched camp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the 26th of August, 1914, towards nine in the morning, a platoon of the 2nd Unmounted Chasseurs, under the command of First Sergeant-Major ---- occupied a trench, constructed by the Germans, at Pont-Br?lé, on the south bank of the Willebroeck Canal. A continual rain of balls from the enemy\u0027s lines soon made the position impossible, even for our men who were firing as they lay on the ground. There was no retreat possible. It was necessary, therefore, at all costs, to cross the canal. There was a bridge only a few yards away, but its platform was[Pg 114] raised and the crank of the windlass was on the opposite bank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Sergeant attempted to construct a raft, but this was almost impossible, as the necessary material was lacking and the enemy\u0027s firing was too frequent and violent. He was compelled to give up this idea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A good swimmer who will volunteer to cross the canal!\" he cried out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Present!\" replied Private Trésignies, getting up from the ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is to go and lower the bridge, my boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Right, Sergeant.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Quite tranquilly, Trésignies wrote on a slip of paper the following words for his wife: \"Adieu, it is for the King.\" He handed the message to his officer, slipped off his clothes, and sprang into the water.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whilst he was swimming, the Sergeant called out to him: \"Trésignies, in the name of the Colonel, I appoint you Corporal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Trésignies smiled in answer to the words, crossed the canal, reached the other bank, climbed on to the abutment of the bridge, and seized the crank. He first turned it the wrong way, raising the bridge still higher, but, on seeing his mistake, he turned it the opposite way. The bridge slowly descended. The man\u0027s tall figure stood out against the horizon, looking like an antique statue. The firing from all sides was now aimed at him. His thighs and his arms were hit. The blood spurted from his wounds and ran down his body. He continued turning, as though nothing had happened, determined to accomplish his work of deliverance. He went on turning and turning until his heart was pierced and he fell down on the blue stone. After a few nervous twitches, his body re[Pg 115]mained still and lifeless, the head hanging down....\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In remembrance of this hero, the Municipal Council of Antwerp decided that one of the streets of the capital should be named after Corporal Trésignies, and that a subscription should be opened for the benefit of his widow and two children.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2770/76583.html","bookId":1332,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:40:07 AM"}
