How Siegfried bare Tidings to the Royal City","content":"\u0026nbsp;Now when they had so sailed onward for nine days over the sea, \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then out spake Hagen of Troneg: “I pray you, hearken to me:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, here we tarry from sending the tidings to Worms on Rhine;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet by this in the land Burgundian should they be, those heralds of thine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer to him King Gunther: “Of a truth good counsel is this;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to send as our tidings-bearer were none so meet, I wis,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As thou thyself, friend Hagen; thou unto my land ride on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Our royal journey may no man better than thou make known.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now nay, Lord King, of heralds nowise the best should I be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let me as thy treasure-warder tarry still on the sea:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here will I bide with the women, and guard their costly array\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till unto the land Burgundian we have brought them on their way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not so; pray rather Siegfried to bear this message for thee:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well can he do thine errand with wisdom and courtesy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If he haply be loth for the journey, in kingly-courteous wise\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Entreat him in kindly fashion by the love in thy sister’s eyes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then unto the knight sent Gunther, and he came before the King;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he said to him: “Nigh are we gotten to my land in our journeying;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now to my dear-loved sister would I send a messenger,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And withal to my mother, to tell them who to the land draw near.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 73}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So then, Lord Siegfried, I pray thee that thou wouldst bear this word,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so will I aye be beholden to thee,” said the Rhineland’s lord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet loth was Siegfried the valiant, and fain would have said him nay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Until the King besought him, and thus did Gunther pray:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said unto him: “For my love’s sake thitherward shouldst thou ride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And withal for the sake of Kriemhild, the maiden lovely-eyed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the end that the royal maiden with me may requite thy pain.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When heard was her name of Siegfried, the knight was exceeding fain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lay on me what charge thou

my heart enshrinèd!—who am I, to deny or defer?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even all that thou requirest will I perform for her.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So then to my mother Uta the Queen of the land say thou\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That with heart uplifted and joyous I am faring homeward now.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And how we have sped in our

fair one, nought shalt thou hide thereof:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Commend unto her Queen Brunhild and me in service of love.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And unto all my servants and to all my vassals say,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whatsoever mine heart hath longed for, all have I gained this day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to Ortwein, my nephew belovèd, bear this hest of mine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That he shall prepare us high-seats in the city beside the Rhine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tell also my vassals and kinsfolk this—be it known to them all\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I purpose for Brunhild’s bridal a high-tide festival.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And make my request to my sister, that now that she hath learned\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How that I to the land Burgundian with these my guests have returned,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She receive with loving welcome this my belovèd bride:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So bound evermore unto Kriemhild shall my love and my service abide.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then of the Lady Brunhild and of all her following\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair leave was taken of Siegfried, the child of Siegmund the King,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even

ran like flame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then all the thanes were troubled, and a wailing moaned all round.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They foreboded that in that far land his

them, the young Prince, hied him with speed:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Came Gernot beside him, his brother, and in eager haste he cried,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he marked how no King Gunther was there by Siegfried’s side:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now welcome to thee, Lord Siegfried!
