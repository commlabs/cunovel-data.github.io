He\u0027s somewhere in his mid-sixties, and I love the fact that he\u0027s still totally into scoring ink. Especially with the process being a little trickier on older skin. But this badass didn\u0027t have to take a break once in four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was so worth the wait,\" he tells me. \"And the drive from New Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when you\u0027re ready for your next one, you let me know. I\u0027ll get you in. No more of this eighteen months shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it. Thanks, brother.\" He tosses me a salute and heads out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot damn. All done. Time to grab my keys and get home to my baby. V says he\u0027s gonna lock up, so there\u0027s a fifty percent shot it\u0027ll get done. No worries though. After I drop Ads at the airport I\u0027ll come back and check on things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Rush, man!\" Vincent calls from the dungeon. \"Come in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor about two seconds, I wonder if I can pretend I didn\u0027t hear him and get the hell out the door and on my way. Shit, Ads and I only have \u0027til midnight. I want to taste her grub, then taste her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rush, I know you\u0027re out there,\" V calls again. \"Get your ass in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. Fine. Thirty seconds. That\u0027s all he gets. I head for his room. The kid always keeps his door open. It\u0027s policy for him. He tells his clients he\u0027s agoraphobic, but that\u0027s total bullshit. He likes to keep an eye on the door. Who\u0027s walking in. If she\u0027s hot. And if she\u0027s brought another hot chick with her for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want, V?\" I say, coming up on his door. \"I\u0027m about to take off...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly hit the doorjamb with my face, because sitting in Vincent\u0027s chair, which incidentally is shaped like an electric chair, complete with restraining straps-the douchebag had the thing custom made-is my baby. Addison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Even as the words come tumbling out of my mouth I have the answer. V\u0027s got his gloves on and Ads has her arm exposed. Holy shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me, man.\" Wiping some goo onto the inside of her forearm, V flashes me his pearlies. \"And you know, I make it a policy to never say no to chicks who have hot asses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Vincent, you\u0027re such a charmer,\" Addison says dryly, though her eyes are on me. \"How Lisa didn\u0027t see that in you, I\u0027ll never understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat shuts him up in a hurry. I gotta remember that trick for next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been here?\" I ask her, but my eyes are already traveling down her arm, over the script V\u0027s just put on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half hour,\" she says. \"So...what do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scratch my head, staring at it. What do I think? My name on her body. RUSH in black ink. Fuck me hard, it\u0027s what I wanted. It makes my insides all warm and shit, and my mouth hungry to kiss her. But then there\u0027s something else snaking around in there. Down low in my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rush?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. Addison is staring at me, sorta excited and worried all at the same time. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, ya\u0027ll,\" comes a southern singsong from the door. It fuses with that thing snaking around in my belly and puts me in an instant bad mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t normally do this,\" she keeps on. \"But my client wants to show it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent\u0027s head jerks around so fast I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s gonna be dealing with whiplash later. \"Who wants to show what off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sweet little client has just had a clit piercing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent makes a noise like air being let out of a balloon. It makes Addison laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rush can finish me up, V,\" she says, looking up at me. \"After all, this part of my skin belongs to him now. And you know, that clit thing sounds like a can\u0027t-miss event.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, man,\" Vincent says to me, pulling off his gloves and stuffing them in the trash. \"You managed to score the coolest chick on the motherfucking planet, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he knows,\" Addison says. \"Don\u0027t you, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s pretty useless to try and stop something that\u0027s just fucking inevitable. But I do. For a second, I actually attempt to send Erica a mental email. Message Line: Get the fuck out and don\u0027t say shit to Addison. But you know. Useless. She strolls into the room and comes over to where we\u0027re all hanging out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this is your girlfriend, Rush?\" Her eyes are moving over Addison like she\u0027s a freaking painting to be studied, maybe even interpreted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. There\u0027s nothing to do, but do. \"Erica Day this is Addison Cramer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Ads says, offering her hand. \"It\u0027s nice to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErica shakes it, but it\u0027s super chill, kinda that up-and-down-once-and-we\u0027re-done thing. \"Addison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAds nods. \"Yeah. And let me say, I think it\u0027s so cool what you do. Maybe when you come back again you could squeeze me in?\" She stops and laughs at herself. \"Not for the clit thing, probably. You know. I should probably start small. Eyebrow or nose or nipple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddison is being cute as fuck and I just want to grab her out of V\u0027s electric chair and take her home. But Erica has just tasted blood and she\u0027s clearly ready to go all vampire on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" she starts, turning to me. \"Wasn\u0027t that ex-girlfriend from high school, the one who stepped out with some other guy and broke your heart, named Addison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t answer her. But I\u0027m pretty sure she sees and understands the death stare I\u0027m throwing her way. We are no longer friends, or colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s some coincidence,\" she adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing our history laid bare by a stranger has Addison up out of her chair. Gone is the cute as fuck thing. Her eyes are pinned to Erica. \"How do you know about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErica shrugs innocently. \"Rush told me. Back when we were together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Together?\" Addison repeats, then looks over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said. \"It really tore him up. Really affected the way he communicated. Our sex life was-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, that\u0027s enough,\" I say in the coldest voice imaginable. \"Erica, you have a pierced clit waiting on you and a full day of appointments. I suggest you get the fuck on it. And then after that, get the fuck out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, she has the decency to look contrite. \"I\u0027m sorry, honey. That was out of line. I just kinda wanted to know.\" She shrugs, gives me one last tight smile, then leaves the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I look back, Addison is standing by V\u0027s table and taping up her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go over to her and reach for her hand. \"Let me do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls away from me. \"So, is this why you sort of discouraged me from coming in today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not about to bullshit her. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Ads. She was three years ago. I don\u0027t give a fuck about her. But I do give a fuck about you. I didn\u0027t want you to feel uncomfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You didn\u0027t want you to feel uncomfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a pain in the ass. Clearly loves causing trouble. She knew about what happened back in high school and I didn\u0027t want you to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I did hear about it,\" she returns hotly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only because you came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth drops open an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\" I growl at my foot-in-mouth assholery. \"That\u0027s not what I mean. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. I want you here all the damn time. I just didn\u0027t want you to have to deal with that kind of drama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifts her chin, her nostrils flaring now. She\u0027s super pissed. \"I suspect that being with you, I\u0027m going to be exposed to all kinds of drama. I know you haven\u0027t been celibate since high school, and I know what kind of tail comes through that door several times a day. Stop protecting me, and prepare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could\u0027ve handled that bitch. But you didn\u0027t prepare me.\" She tosses the rest of the tape on the table and heads for the door. \"I\u0027m out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow. Course I fucking follow. I love her to death. \"Addison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need some time, Rush.\" She doesn\u0027t even slow, doesn\u0027t even glance over her shoulder. Just hits the front door of the shop and keeps on going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce outside, I stop. She\u0027s already in my car, and she\u0027s right. I fucked up. She deserves some cooling off. Shit. This was not the day I had planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking at me, Addison backs up and drives off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute of staring at her receding taillights, I head back inside. I\u0027m feeling murderous and I\u0027m ready to fire anyone who crosses my path and says something stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent\u0027s behind the desk, taking a credit card from his client. \"She gone?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot him a warning glare. \"What do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, man,\" he says with exactly zero sympathy. \"Name tats. Kiss of fucking death.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-10.html","bookId":1916,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:41 PM"}
