I\u0027m sure there\u0027s hairier cliffs ahead of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe craned her head back. Villanueva was just a blur of light at the edge of the cliff above. She suppressed a groan, leaning on a stalagmite. And this was only day one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley rubbed her back, lowering herself slowly onto her air mattress. She could hear Michaelson mumbling into the radio several yards away, giving his final report of the day. The team had discovered signs of the previous party\u0027s passage-discarded items, boot tracks in silt, scruffs on rock-and were sticking close to their trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a long sigh, stretching. A sharp jab in her lower back protested the motion. Their progress today seemed more like a battle. Slippery mud covered most of the walkways; sharp gypsum crystals clung to her entire body like sand on a beach, and grew more abrasive with each step; steep slopes and sharp inclines impeded their forward movement, slowing them to a crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst of all, though, was the heat. An omnipresent wet blanket that grew heavier as the day\u0027s journey wore on. She took off her headband and twisted it, wringing out a stream of sweat. She now understood how risky dehydration was in caving. She unscrewed the top of her canteen, almost empty now. Tipping it back, she swallowed the last warm drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to watch your water,\" Ben warned. \"We can\u0027t count on finding a water hole every day.\" He nodded toward the small lake pooled in the back half of the cavern, half hidden by an outcropping of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew about this water hole,\" she said. \"It\u0027s on the map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but this is the last cavern marked on the map. From here, it\u0027s to points unknown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027ll be more conservative tomorrow. We should remind everyone in the morning. Especially Linda. She ran out of water at lunch and has been borrowing from my canteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours too, huh?\" Ben said with a smile. \"She finished the last of mine an hour ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clever girl,\" Ashley said. \"By the way, where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over at the pond… getting a drink of water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Tomorrow we\u0027ll need to be more strict with rationing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, just leave her be. I was just joking. She\u0027s over there doing a water analysis. Besides, she\u0027s having a tough time of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen gestured toward the two SEALs, who were setting up the campstove a handful of yards away. Light pooled around them from their lanterns. \"They barely broke a sweat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as Villanueva stripped off a khaki T-shirt and wiped his face and armpits before slipping into a green vest. With a small pop, Halloway lit the butane for the campstove. Both appeared as refreshed as if today\u0027s journey were nothing more than a Sunday walk through the park, while everyone else dragged as if just completing the Bataan death march, haggard, bone-tired. Her stomach rumbled audibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen raised an eyebrow. \"I\u0027m hungry too. But there\u0027s nothing except freeze-dried beans and franks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, that would fit the bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen grinned. \"Though a beer to wash it all down… now, that would be heaven.\" As he sat down on his own mattress, he suddenly swatted at his arm. \"Hey, something just bit me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shined a light on his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned over and looked at the spot. \"Looks like a mosquito.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody large skeeter. Just \u0027bout took a chunk out of my arm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit exaggerating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked her with a finger. \"Wait until you get speared. Don\u0027t come crying to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s odd,\" she said, scratching behind an ear. \"What\u0027s a mosquito doing in Antarctica? Way down here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s expression became serious. \"Good question. You don\u0027t often find insects down here. Crickets, a few spiders, centipedes, that sort of thing-but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen a mosquito.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley wondered at the significance of such a discovery. \"Maybe we\u0027d better ask our biologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for sharing your water today, Khalid,\" said Linda. \"I couldn\u0027t have made it without your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime,\" he said, breathing in the dank air. He sat on a rock, watching Linda scooping water into small glass vials. He appreciated the wide furrow of moisture down the middle of her back, pasting the cotton T-shirt to her body. The clasp of her bra was visible through the thin fabric. He bit his tongue to control his rising lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling at him, Linda stood up and sat on the boulder beside him, shaking the vial in her hand. \"That last ridge was brutal. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re done for the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her body heat pulsing across the hand span of space between them. They sat in silence, Linda studying the crystal surface of the pond, Khalid studying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My god!\" she suddenly exclaimed, jumping to the edge of the black water. \"Khalid, look over here.\" She crouched on her knees, waving him toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed to her, inhaling her scent, a hypnotic perfume in the moist air. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a curled shell, dripping and luminescent in the lamp\u0027s glow, that had been partially hidden by a rock in the shallows. Khalid cocked his head to the side. It looked similar to a snail\u0027s shell, but it was huge. Almost the size of a watermelon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked again. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled into a seated position, cradling the large shell in her lap. \"If it\u0027s what I think it is…\" She shook her head and placed a hand on his knee. \"If it wasn\u0027t for your insistence that we stay a little longer, I may have missed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand was a burning ember on his knee. He fought against pulling her into a hard embrace. A tightening in the crotch of his coveralls protested his restraint. \"What\u0027s so special about an empty shell?\" he asked in a strained voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could answer, voices intruded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you, the damned skeeter bit worse than a snake with broken fangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen spotted Khalid and Linda crouched by the shore of the pond. He noticed Linda slip her hand from the geologist\u0027s knee just as they rounded the rocky escarpment. Ben raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley cleared her throat, announcing their presence. \"Linda,\" she said as she approached, \"Ben was just bitten by an insect that looks a lot like a mosquito. We wanted your opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure, no problem. Did you catch one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, kind of,\" he said, pointing to the smashed bug still smeared on his forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, taking his forearm in her hands and rotating it into the light. \"You didn\u0027t leave me much to go on.\" She leaned in closer. \"I can\u0027t say for sure. There are hundreds of species of blood-hungry midges, flies, and mosquitoes. This could be anything.\" She released his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was curious,\" Ashley said. \"Ben told me there are seldom any biting insects in caves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda scrunched up her eyebrows. \"That makes sense. What would they feed on? No warm-blooded species down here.\" She shook her head. \"They must gain sustenance in some other manner, but this individual was taking advantage of a new source for lunch.\" She shrugged. \"These caverns just get more and more curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clasped one arm around a large shell. \"Look at this, for instance.\" She held up the shell for Ashley and Ben to examine. \"Do you recognize this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley took it from her and held it up, rotating it to view it from all angles and running a hand along its spiral loop. \"Looks like a mollusk shell, but I\u0027m unfamiliar with the species. Besides, you\u0027re the biologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re the archaeologist. If it wasn\u0027t for my study of evolutionary biology, I wouldn\u0027t have recognized it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you think it is?\" Ben asked, lifting the shell into his hands, curious what all the commotion was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the shell from an ammonite, a predatory squid,\" Linda said. \"Species Maorites densicostatus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Ashley snatched the shell back from Ben. She examined it again with keener interest, now holding it like it was the finest porcelain. \"That\u0027s impossible. This is an actual shell. Not a fossil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stared at his empty hands. \"What\u0027s the big deal? What\u0027s so bloody exciting about it anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth women ignored him. \"Are you sure?\" Ashley asked. \"Paleobiology was not a specialty of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Linda said. \"Look here, at these striations. No modern mollusk has this conformation. And look at the chambering inside. Only one species has this unique shell. Definitely an ammonite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley leaned in closer. \"But what\u0027s it doing here? Ammonites died out with the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period. This is an old shell, but I don\u0027t believe it dates back sixty-five million years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take a look,\" Ben said, lifting the shell. \"Many caves have preserved fossils, protected from the weather. Maybe this shell is just well preserved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda nodded. \"Perhaps. But before the expedition, in preparation for the trip, I read up on Antarctica\u0027s wildlife. On Seymour Island not far from here, scientists discovered many ammonite fossils. Remains that dated later than the Cretaceous extinction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cretaceous extinction?\" Ben asked. \"What\u0027re you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley answered, \"About 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, a great cataclysm wiped out huge numbers of species, including the dinosaurs. Some researchers theorized a massive asteroid struck the earth at that time, blowing up clouds of dust that blocked the sun and chilled the planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Linda added. \"And the paleontologists studying Antarctica now believe that Antarctica\u0027s polar vortex may have stirred the winds enough to keep the asteroid\u0027s sky-darkening particles clear of this area, sparing this continent the great extinction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen interrupted. \"That\u0027s all old history. So these snails survived longer than anyone thought. So what? I mean-\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-16.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
