no meat in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby, Jelly, and Greta sat at a separate table, not acknowledging them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick kept an eye on the street outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that Michel was in terrible danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had contemplated going to warn him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have gone to the Moulier place-but that would have played into the hands of the Gestapo, who must be following Michelin the hope that he would lead them to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven to phone the Moulier place would have risked betraying her hideout to a Gestapo eavesdropper at the telephone exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, she had decided, the best thing she could do to help Michel was not to contact him directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf her theory was right, Dieter Franck would let Michel remain at large until Flick was caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she had left a message for Michel with Madame LapeMeme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel- I am sure you are under surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place we were at last night was raided after you left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have probably been followed this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will leave before you get here and make ourselves inconspicuous in the town center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePark the van near the railway station and leave the key under the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet a train to Marles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShake off your shadow and come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe careful-please! -Flick Now burn this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed good in theory, but she waited all morning in a fever of tension to see whether it would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at eleven o\u0027clock, she saw a high van draw up and park near the station entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the side, in white lettering, she read Moulier \u0026amp; Fils-Viandes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel got out, and she breathed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked into the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was carrying out her plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked to see who might be following him, but it was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople arrived at the station constantly, on foot, on bicycles, and in cars, and any of them might have been shadowing Michel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained in the cafepretending to drink the bitter, unsatisfying coffee substitute, keeping an eye on the van, trying to discover whether it was under surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied the people and vehicles coming and going outside the station, but she did not spot anyone who might have been watching the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter fifteen minutes, she nodded to Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got up, picked up their cases, and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick opened the van door and got into the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul got in the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s heart was in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was a Gestapo trap, now would be the moment when they arrested her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fumbled beneath her seat and found a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one seemed to have noticed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby, Jelly, and Greta came out of the cafeFlick jerked her head to indicate that they should get in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van was fitted out with shelves and cupboards, and trays for ice to keep the temperature down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything looked as if it had been well scrubbed, but there remained a faint, unpleasant odor of raw meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rear doors opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other three women threw their suitcases into the van and clambered in after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby pulled the doors shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick put the gearshift into first and drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did it!\" Jelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank gordon.\" Flick smiled thinly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hard part was still ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove out of town on the road to Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched for police cars and Gestapo Citroens, but she felt fairly safe for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van\u0027s lettering announced its legitimacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was not unusual for a woman to be driving such a vehicle, when so many Frenchmen were in labor camps in Germany-or had fled to the hills and joined the Maquis to avoid being sent to the camps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after midday they reached Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick noted the sudden miraculous quiet that always fell on French streets at the stroke of noon, as the people turned their attention to the first serious meal of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove to Antoinette\u0027s building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of tall wooden doors, half-open, led to the inner courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul leaped out of the van and opened the doors, Flick drove in, and Paul closed the doors behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the van, with its distinctive legend, could not be seen from the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come when I whistle,\" Flick said, and she jumped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to Antoinette\u0027s door while the others waited in the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time she had knocked on this door, eight days and a lifetime ago, Michel\u0027s aunt Antoinette had hesitated to answer, jumpy on account of the gunfire from the square, but today she came right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door, a slim middle-aged woman in a stylish but faded yellow cotton dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked blankly at Flick for a moment: Flick still had on the dark wig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen recognition dawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of panic came over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" Flick whistled to the others, then pushed Antoinette back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to tie you up so the Germans will think we forced you.\" \"What is this?\" Antoinette said shakily \"I\u0027ll explain in a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you alone?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good.\" The others came in and Ruby closed the apartment door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went into Antoinette\u0027s kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA meal was laid out on the table: black bread, a salad of shredded carrots, a heel of cheese, a wine bottle without a label.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntoinette said again, \"What is this?\" \"Sit down,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finish your lunch.\" She sat down, but she said, \"I can\u0027t eat.\" \"It\u0027s very simple,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and your ladies are not going to clean the chateau tonight..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe are.\" She looked baffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will that happen?\" \"We\u0027re going to send notes to each of the women on duty tonight, telling them to come here and see you before they go to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrive, we will tie them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we will go to the chateau instead of them.\" \"You can\u0027t, you don\u0027t have passes.\" \"Yes, we do.\" \"How.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e?\" Antoinette gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stole my pass! Last Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I had lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got into the most terrible trouble with the Germans!\" \"I\u0027m sorry you got into trouble.\" \"But this will be worse-you\u0027re going to blow the place up!\" Antoinette began to moan and rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll blame me, you know what they\u0027re like, we\u0027ll all be tortured.\" Flick gritted her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that Antoinette could be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo might easily kill the real cleaners just in case they had had something to do with the deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to do everything we can to make you look innocent,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be our victims, the same as the Germans.\" All the same, there remained a risk, Flick knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t believe us,\" Antoinette moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We might be killed.\" Flick hardened her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why it\u0027s called a war.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-47.html","bookId":2681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM"}
