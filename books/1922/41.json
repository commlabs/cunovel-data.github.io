He threw his head back, shuddering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Eva!\" He clasped me so tightly I couldn\u0027t breathe, his h*ps pumping as he came long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve no idea how long we lay like that, leveled, mouths sliding over shoulders and throats to soothe and calm. My entire body tingled and pulsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" I managed finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll kill me,\" he muttered with his lips at my jaw. \"We\u0027re going to end up f**king each other to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? I didn\u0027t do anything.\" He\u0027d controlled me completely and how freakin\u0027 sexy was that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re breathing. That\u0027s enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, hugging him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his head, he nuzzled my nose. \"We\u0027re going to eat, and then we\u0027ll do that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows lifted. \"You can do that again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All night.\" He rolled his h*ps and I could feel that he was still semi-hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a machine,\" I told him. \"Or a god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s you.\" With a soft sweet kiss, he left me. He removed the condom, wrapped it in a tissue from the nightstand, and tossed the whole in the wastebasket by the bed. \"We\u0027ll shower, then order from the restaurant downstairs. Unless you want to go down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I can walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flash of his grin stopped my heart for a minute. \"Glad I\u0027m not the only one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel phenomenal.\" He sat back on the side of the bed and brushed my hair back from my forehead. His face was soft, his smile warmly affectionate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I saw something else in his eyes and the possibility closed my throat. It scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shower with me,\" he said, running his hand down my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gimme me a minute to find my brain, then I\u0027ll join you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He went into the bathroom, giving me a prime view of his sculpted back and perfect ass. I sighed with pure female appreciation of a prime male specimen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water came on in the shower. I managed to sit up and slide my legs over the side of the bed, feeling exquisitely shaky. My gaze caught on the slightly open bedside drawer and I saw condoms through the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach twisted. The hotel was too upscale to be the kind that provided condoms along with the requisite Bible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a slightly trembling hand, I pulled the drawer out further and found a sizable quantity of prophylactics, including a bottle of feminine lubrication and spermicidal gel. My heart started pounding all over again. In my mind, I backtracked through our lust-fueled trip to the hotel. Gideon hadn\u0027t asked which rooms were available. Whether he had a master key or not, he\u0027d need to know which rooms were occupied before he took one...unless he\u0027d known beforehand that this particular room would be empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly it was his room - a f**k pad outfitted with everything he\u0027d need to have a good time with the women who served that purpose in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I pushed to my feet and walked over to the closet, I heard the glass shower door open in the bathroom, then close. I caught the two knobs of the louvered walnut closet doors and pushed them apart. There was a small selection of men\u0027s clothes hanging on the metal rod, some business shirts and slacks, as well as khakis and jeans. My temperature dropped and a sick misery spread through my orgasmic high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe right side dresser drawers held neatly folded T-shirts, boxer briefs, and socks. The top one on the left side held sex toys still in their packages. I didn\u0027t look at the drawers below that one. I\u0027d seen enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled on my pants and stole one of Gideon\u0027s shirts. As I dressed, my mind went through the steps I\u0027d learned in therapy: Talk it out. Explain what triggered the negative feelings to your partner. Face the trigger and work through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if I\u0027d been less shaken by the depth of my feelings for Gideon, I could have done all that. Maybe if we hadn\u0027t just had mind-blowing sex, I would have felt less raw and vulnerable. I\u0027d never know. What I felt was slightly dirty, a little bit used, and a whole lot hurt. This particular revelation had hit me with excruciating force, and like a child, I wanted to hurt him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooped up the condoms, lube, and toys, and tossed them on the bed. Then, just as he called out my name in an amused and teasing voice, I picked up my bag and left him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my head down as I made the walk of shame past the registration desk and exited the hotel through a side door. I was red-faced with embarrassment remembering the manager who\u0027d greeted Gideon as we got on the elevator. I could only imagine what he\u0027d thought of me. He had to know what Gideon reserved that room for. I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of being the next in a line of many and yet that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027d been from the moment we entered the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow hard would it have been to stop by the front desk and secure a room that was ours alone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started walking with no direction or destination in mind. It was dark out now, the city taking on a whole new life and energy from what it had during the business day. Steaming food carts dotted the sidewalks, along with a vendor selling framed artwork, another hawking novelty T-shirts, and yet another who had two folding tables covered in movie and television episode scripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every step I took, the adrenaline from my flight burned away. The maliciously gleeful thoughts of Gideon coming out of the bathroom to find an empty room and paraphernalia-strewn bed ran their course. I began to calm down...and seriously think about what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a coincidence that Gideon invited me to a gym that just so happened to be conveniently close to his f**k pad? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-41.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
