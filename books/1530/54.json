Good. “Order your men to shoot anyone who gets close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia tensed at her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra pointed to the map. “The sooner we solve this mystery, the sooner we’re out of here.” That should light a fire under the curator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia stared sullenly at the map. “There must be some distance marker built into the artifact. Something we missed. A way to determine how far down this red line we must travel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia closed her eyes, rocking a bit. Then she suddenly stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The spear,” she said, glancing to the door. “I noticed striations along its shaft, marks scored into it. I thought them merely decoration. But back in the ancient past, measurements were often recorded as notches on a stick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you think the number of marks could signify a distance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia nodded and began to stand. “I have to count them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra distrusted the woman. It would be easy to lie and lead them astray. She needed accuracy. “Kane, go out and count the number of marks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced but obeyed, slapping on his sodden ball cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he left, Cassandra crouched by the map. “This has to be the final location. First the coast, then the mountain, now the desert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia shrugged. “You’re probably right. The number three is significant to ancient faiths. Whether it’s the trinity of the Christian God—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—or the ancient celestial trinity: the moon, the sun, and the morning star.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane appeared in the doorway, shaking rain from his cap. “Sixty-nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled at her. “Yes, I’m bloody damned sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sixty-nine,” Safia said. “That has to be right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Cassandra asked, turning her attention back to the curator as she bent over the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six and nine,” Safia explained to the map. “Multiples of three. Just like we were talking about. Sequential, too. A very magical number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And here I always thought ‘sixty-nine’ meant something else,” Kane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeemingly deaf to the man, Safia continued to work, measuring with a protractor and tapping a calculator. Cassandra watched over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is sixty-nine miles along the red line.” Safia circled the spot. “It ends up here in the desert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra knelt down, took the protractor, and rechecked her measurements. She stared at the red circle, noting the longitude and latitude in her head. “So this may be the location of the lost city?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia nodded. She continued to stare at the map. “As best I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra’s brow crinkled, sensing the woman was keeping something from her. She could almost see the woman calculating something in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed Safia’s wrist. “What are you holding back—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shot rang out nearby, clipping away any further words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be a misfire. It could be one of the bedouin shooting off his rifle. But Cassandra knew better. She swung around. “Painter…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:32 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP AINTER’S FIRST shot went wild as he fell backward out the mosque’s doorway and onto the porch. A corner of a wall blasted away in a shower of plaster. Inside, the leopards parted, vanishing into the shadows of the mosque.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter flung himself to the side, sheltering behind the half wall of the porch. Stupid. He shouldn’t have shot. He had reacted out of instinct, self-preservation. That wasn’t like him. But some terror beyond the leopards had gripped him, as if something had jangled the deepest root of his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he had given away the element of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Painter!” The shout came from the direction of the tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Cassandra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter dared not move. Leopards prowled on the inside, Cassandra on the outside. The lady or the tiger? In this case, both meant death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you came for the woman!” Cassandra shouted into the rain. A rumble of thunder punctuated her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter remained quiet. Cassandra couldn’t know for sure in which direction his gunshot had come from. Sound traveled oddly among these mountainous hills. He imagined her hiding in the tomb, calling out from the doorway. She dared not move into the open. She knew he was armed, but she didn’t know where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he use that to his advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t show yourself—arms up, hands empty—in the next ten seconds, I’m going to shoot the prisoner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to think quickly. To reveal himself now would only mean his death, along with Safia’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you’d come, Crowe! Did you really think that I’d believe you were heading to the border of Yemen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter flinched. He had sent out the e-mail only hours ago, planted with false information, delivered through a secure server to his boss. It had been a test balloon. As he feared, word had reached Cassandra intact. A sense of despair settled over him. That could only mean one thing. The betrayal of Sigma started at the very top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean McKnight…his own boss…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that why Sean had paired him with Cassandra to begin with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter closed his eyes and took a deep breath, sensing his isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was now alone out here, cut off. He had no one to contact, no one to trust. Oddly, this thought only helped energize him. He felt a giddy sense of freedom. He had to rely on himself and his immediate resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would have to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter reached into his ditty bag and palmed the radio transmitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder growled, throatier, guttural. Rain fell harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five seconds, Crowe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the time in the world…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stabbed the transmitter’s button and rolled toward the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:34 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eF ROM SEVENTY yards away, Omaha jolted as the twin explosions rocketed the two SUVs into the air, as bright as lightning strikes. The dark night went brilliant. The concussion squeezed his ears, thundered in his rib cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Painter’s signal. He had secured Safia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment ago, Omaha had heard a single gunshot, terrifying him. Now flames and debris rained down across the parking lot. Men lay sprawled in the dirt. Two were on fire, bathed in burning gasoline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now!” Omaha shouted, but his yell sounded tinny in his own ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, rifle fire spat out of the forest to either side of Omaha. Additionally, a few flashes of muzzle fire sparked from a high shoulder that overlooked the parking lot, coming from a pair of Bait Kathir snipers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp at the tomb, two guards had been picking themselves off the ground. They suddenly jerked, bodies thrown backward. Shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther guards sought cover, reacting with well-honed skill. These were no amateurs. They retreated over the compound walls, seeking fast cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha lifted his binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtop the hill’s plateau, the two burning SUVs lit the parking lot. The third vehicle had been shoved a few feet by the concussion. Pools of flaming gasoline dotted the dirt and hood, steaming in the rain. Painter was supposed to use the vehicle as an escape vehicle. He should’ve been there by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was he? What was he waiting for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ululating cry rose to Omaha’s right. Bells jangled. A dozen camels scattered uphill. Amid them ran more of the Bait Kathir. Cover fire rained from out of the tree line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few shots now answered. A camel bellowed, dropping to one knee, skidding in the dirt. An explosion ripped into the hillside off to Omaha’s left. A flash of fire and torn tree limbs, smoking leaves, and dirt flumed upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a new sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came from the deep gorge to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive small helicopters rose into view, as swift as gnats and as tiny. One-man vehicles. Just blades, engine, and pilot. They looked like flying sleds. Spotlights swept the grounds, peppering the area with automatic gunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamels and men fled in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha clenched a fist. The bitch had been expecting them. She’d had a backup force lying in wait, an ambush. How had she known?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral and Barak appeared at Omaha’s elbow. “Painter’s going to need help,” Coral hissed. “He can’t reach the escape vehicle now. It’s too exposed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha glanced up to the lot, now a bloodbath of bodies and camels. From the forest, shots fired up at the helicopters, driving them higher. But they continued a zigzagging pattern over the compound, guarding it tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire plan had fallen to shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Safia was up there. Omaha was not leaving her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral freed her pistol. “I’m going in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha grabbed her arm. Her muscles were cords of steel. He held tight, brooking no argument. “This time, we’re all going in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:35 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK ARA STARED down at the Kalashnikov rifle on her lap. Fingers twitching uncontrollably on the stock, she found it hard to concentrate. Her eyes felt too large for her head, threatening a migraine, while nausea lapped at her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreamed of a little orange pill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her side, Clay fought to get the engine started. He cranked it again, but it failed to turn over. Danny sat in the backseat with the lone pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe explosion had lit up the northern hills like a rising sun. It was Painter’s signal. Across the intervening two valleys, echoing spatters of gunfire sounded like fireworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Piece of shit!” Clay swore, and struck his hand on the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve flooded it,” Danny said sourly from the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stared out the passenger window. A ruddy glow persisted to the north. It had started. If all went well, the others would be racing downhill in one of the kidnappers’ SUVs. The remainder of the party would scatter into the hills. The Bait Kathir knew many paths through the forested mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something felt wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was just the edgy frazzle in Kara’s head. It grew more acute with each breath. Pain lanced behind her eyes. Even the light of the dashboard stabbed painfully bright. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-54.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
