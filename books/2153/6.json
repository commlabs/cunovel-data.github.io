He pointed to the image on the table, said: \"Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No - they have to face the realities here .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp,\" Hawat said. \"Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicing\u0027s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we shield them?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to Idaho \u0027s report,\" Hawat said, \"shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We\u0027ve the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None at all?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027d be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people,\" Hawat said. \" Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a puzzle,\" the Duke said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,\" Hawat said. \"They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t seem likely,\" Hawat said. \"It\u0027s theoretically possible, of course - a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one\u0027s ever been able to put it to the test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d have heard about it before now,\" Halleck said. \"The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would\u0027ve acquired such a device if it were available. And they\u0027d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like an unanswered question of this importance,\" Leto said. \"Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re already working on it, my Lord.\" He cleared his throat. \" Ah-h , Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn\u0027t mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke frowned, then: \"The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat gestured to his aide at the projector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. \"This is a carryall,\" Hawat said. \"It\u0027s essentially a large \u0027thopter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,\" the Duke said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter was abrupt and too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These \u0027thopters are fairly conventional,\" Hawat said. \"Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded - possibly discarding the shield generator\u0027s weight for greater range.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this de-emphasis on shields,\" the Duke muttered. And he thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won\u0027t even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: \"Let\u0027s get to the working estimate. What\u0027ll our profit figure be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat turned two pages in his notebook. \"After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we\u0027ve worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It\u0027s based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.\" He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: \"Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We\u0027ll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.\" He opened his eyes. \"Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re working for a solid and permanent planetary base,\" the Duke said. \"We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy - especially the Fremen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most especially the Fremen,\" Hawat agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our supremacy on Caladan,\" the Duke said, \"depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it\u0027s possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of \u0027thopter shields.\" He shook his head. \"The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don\u0027t dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,\" Hawat said. \"Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is,\" the Duke said, \"exactly as we expected. We\u0027ll have to move fast with the Fremen. I\u0027d like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not much time, Sire,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have much time, as you well know. They\u0027ll be here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they\u0027ll ship in, Thufir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more. Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different - profits or no profits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do our best, Sire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat\u0027s great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides. Aged . It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much depends on one aged man , Paul thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re presently in a war of assassins,\" the Duke said, \"but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what\u0027s the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain - perhaps a hundred people in all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,\" the Duke said, \"were they propertied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most were well situated, my Lord - in the entrepreneur class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them,\" the Duke said. \"File copies with the Judge of the Change. We\u0027ll take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. \"A move worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn\u0027t think of it first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul\u0027s face. The others were smiling and nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s wrong , Paul thought. This\u0027ll only make the others fight all the harder. They\u0027ve nothing to gain by surrendering .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I have been a stranger in a strange land,\u0027 \" Halleck quoted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. \"Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They\u0027re all in useful categories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more?\" The Duke pursed his lips, then: \"Well, pass the word along to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto waved him back, said: \"Speak out, Duncan . You can see this is strategy staff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul studied Idaho , marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho \u0027s dark round face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: \"We\u0027ve taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier - badly wounded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I\u0027d seen how badly off the man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.\" Idaho glanced down at Leto. \"A knife, m\u0027Lord, a knife the like of which you\u0027ve never seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crysknife?\" someone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt of it,\" Idaho said. \"Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.\" He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep that blade in its sheath!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue - no white in them at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him enter,\" Idaho whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pass that man,\" the Duke said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome, sir,\" Leto said. \"And why shouldn\u0027t we unsheath this blade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar glanced at Idaho , said: \"You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.\" His gaze swept the others in the room. \"But I do not know these others. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the Duke Leto,\" the Duke said. \"Would you permit me to see this blade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,\" Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand. \"I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader - a Fremen leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: \"Who\u0027s he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed,\" the Fremen said. \"Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.\" He passed a dark glance across Idaho . \"They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: \"The Duke Leto determines whether - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, please,\" Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. This must not get out of hand , he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: \"Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered - by me . And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho \u0027s voice boomed across the room: \"Hold!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: \"We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body\u0027s moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.\" And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside to the Duke, he said; \"Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul\u0027s eye, a rueful grin on his son\u0027s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen looked at Idaho , said: \"You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho.

We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father\u0027s attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to him, Father,\" Paul said in a low voice. \"He speaks truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sire,\" Hawat said, \"those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It\u0027d be rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from the Imperium. We mustn\u0027t forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it gently, then,\" the Duke said. \"I wish to know only if those bases exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you will, Sire.\" Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then,\" the Duke said. \"We know what we have ahead of us - work. We\u0027ve been trained for it. We\u0027ve some experience in it. We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough.

When you have them ready, I\u0027ll want to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ended up in confusion , Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat - not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father is desperate , he thought. Things aren\u0027t going well for us at all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hawat - Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference - subtle hesitations, signs of unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat was deeply troubled by something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son,\" the Duke said. \"It\u0027ll be dawn soon, anyway. I\u0027ll inform your mother.\" He got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. \"Why don\u0027t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not very tired, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a caged animal , Paul thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. \"We\u0027ve discussed the possibility many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The old woman seemed so sure of herself,\" Paul said. \"And the message Mother - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precautions have been taken,\" the Duke said. He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father\u0027s eyes. \"Remain here. There are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir.\" He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman\u0027s warning: \" - for the father, nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that first day when Muad\u0027Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: \"Mahdi!\" But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"Manual of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen \"H \" had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The chairs are liberated but quite safe,\" Hawat said. \"Where is Paul, Sire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left him in the conference room. I\u0027m hoping he\u0027ll get some rest without me there to distract him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thufir,\" Leto said, \"the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M\u0027Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke pursed his lips. \"Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.\" He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. \"Ignore the Emperor\u0027s hoard. He\u0027d secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat shook his head. \"We\u0027ve few men to spare. Sire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use some of Idaho \u0027s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime - there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, my Lord.\" Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I\u0027ve private reports of traitors. Well - best quiet his fears immediately .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thufir,\" he said, \"since you\u0027re one of the few I can trust completely, there\u0027s another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces . . . but I have two new reports.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat turned, stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat\u0027s agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto studied the old man and, presently, said: \"You\u0027ve been holding something back, old friend. I should\u0027ve suspected when you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat\u0027s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said: \"My Lord, I don\u0027t quite know how to broach this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,\" the Duke said. \"You know you can broach any subject with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Leto demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat shrugged. \"It\u0027s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We\u0027ve good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note - it\u0027s a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It\u0027s susceptible to various interpretations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the delicate content of this note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat rubbed at his lips. \"It says: \u0027. . . eto will never suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to destroy him.\u0027 The note was under the Baron\u0027s own seal and I\u0027ve authenticated the seal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your suspicion is obvious,\" the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,\" Hawat said. \"My Lord, what if . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lady Jessica,\" Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. \"Couldn\u0027t you wring the facts out of this Pardee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier. The courier, I\u0027m certain, did not know what he carried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can\u0027t be anything in it. I know my woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord, if - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" the Duke barked. \"There\u0027s a mistake here that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot ignore it, my Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been with me for sixteen years!

This could be a work of art among vendettas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke\u0027s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. It cannot be , he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An interpretation I\u0027ve considered,\" Hawat said. \"Still. . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suggest?\" the Duke whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now, constant surveillance, my Lord.

He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls . . . people who saluted and stood aside for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard\u0027s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At ease,\" the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the southern horizon, the night\u0027s second moon peered through a thin dust haze - an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger shot through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time , he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw - as the hawk among lesser birds . Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things beggar likeness , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the night\u0027s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet . . . like giant footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a beautiful morning.

Perhaps it could become a good home for my son .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices - dew gatherers. Water so precious here that even the dew must be collected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it could be a hideous place , the Duke thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- with human flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"Collected Sayings of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke said: \"Paul, I\u0027m doing a hateful thing, but I must.\" He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing\u0027s sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke\u0027s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat\u0027s experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mahdi! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lisan al-Gaib! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope , he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hateful thing,\" the Duke said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto turned, looked down at his son. \"Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother.

The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might just as well mistrust me,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have to think they\u0027ve succeeded,\" the Duke said. \"They must think me this much of a fool.
