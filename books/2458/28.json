What...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire held a finger to her lips, hushing Sherry and heard what sounded like an alarm from some- where outside, a repeating, muffled bleat of honking noise. There seemed to be talking, too, but Claire could only make out the faintest mumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, sweetie, I think the ride\u0027s over. Let\u0027s see where we ended up, okay? And stay close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved out of the transport room and onto the platform, the distant sounds not so distant any-more and there was light, coming from somewhere behind the lift. Claire took Sherry\u0027s hand as they walked quickly around, not wanting to worry the girl but feeling pretty sure that it was an alarm they were hearing. There was definitely someone speaking over the rhythmic squeals, too, and Claire wanted to know what they were saying. The lift had stopped only a few feet down from some kind of a service tunnel, the light she\u0027d seen coming from a caged bulb that hung down from the tunnel\u0027s ceiling. There wasn\u0027t a door, but there was a decent-sized crawl space at the end of the short passage; it would have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s either that or climb back to the surface, probably only a mile or so up...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a chance. Claire boosted Sherry up and then climbed after her, moving to the front and then crouch-walking to the dark hole. The bleating sound got louder the closer she got to the crawl space, the mumble transforming into a woman\u0027s voice. She strained to hear the words, hoping that she\u0027d catch \"elevator malfunction\" and \"temporary\", but she still couldn\u0027t make it out. They\u0027d have to abandon the lift and hope that they were leaving it for something better. Claire swiveled around, sighing. \"Looks like crawl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etime for me and thee, kiddo. I\u0027ll go first, and then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSLAM! Sherry shrieked as something landed on the roof of the transport behind them, crashing through the top in a thundering clap of rending metal. Claire grabbed her, pulling her close, her breath caught in her throat...... and a hand, two hands appeared through the hole in the roof. Two thick arms, clad in shadow...... and the gleaming white of Mr. X\u0027s enormous skull rose up from the destroyed lift, like a dead moon on a starless night. Claire turned and pushed Sherry toward the dark- ness of the crawl space, her heart hammering, her body suddenly slick with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go! Go, I\u0027m right behind you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry disappeared into the curving black, darting out of sight like a frightened mouse, and Claire didn\u0027t look back, was too scared shitless to look back as she followed Sherry into the hole, their relentless stalker surely climbing through the shattered elevator to continue his determined and unfathomable hunt. Ada had heard pieces of Annette\u0027s screaming rant from the shadows of the catwalk hub, where the three metal spans joined. She\u0027d forced herself not to rush to Leon\u0027s aid, promising herself that if she heard shots, she\u0027d reconsider...... but then the laboratory facility had been vio- lently shaken, and the bland voice of the recording started its loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAda staggered to her feet, furious at the woman scientist, a part of her aching for Leon, knowing what this meant. Annette had triggered the fail-safe, which meant they probably had less than ten minutes to get the hell out of Dodge...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and Leon doesn\u0027t know the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not important. If she was going to collect the sample, which Annette surely had on her, she needed to do it now. Leon wasn\u0027t her problem, he\u0027d never been her problem, and she couldn\u0027t quit now, not after the hell she\u0027d been through to get Trent\u0027s pre- cious virus. Ada took a single step away from the main fuse panel that connected the three catwalks and heard the pounding footsteps coming toward her, footsteps too heavy to be Annette\u0027s. She slid back into the shadows and around to the span that led west, press-ing herself against the hub\u0027s frame. A second later, Leon went running past, probably back to where he thought she\u0027d be waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAda took a deep breath, blowing it out as she swept Leon from her mind, and hurried across the southern bridge to find Annette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAda was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...has been activated. This auto-destruct sequence...\" \"Shut up, shut up...\" Leon hissed, standing help-lessly in the middle of the room, his stomach knotted, his hands balled into fists. When she\u0027d heard the alarm, she must have pan- icked and run. She was probably stumbling through the giant facility, lost and dazed, maybe looking for him as that infernally calm voice repeated, as the sirens blared and rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transport lift!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeon turned and ran back through the door and saw that it was gone, a large empty hole a few feet deep where it had been. He\u0027d been too intent on getting to Ada, he hadn\u0027t even noticed that it wasn\u0027t there anymore...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... we have to find that tunnel, we have to! Without the lift, we\u0027re trapped here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a silent howl of frustration, Leon turned and ran back toward the catwalks, praying that he would find her before it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crawl space ended abruptly, stopping over at least a seven-foot drop to an empty tunnel. Her ears ringing, her mouth dry as dust, Sherry grabbed the edges of the square hole, closed her eyes, and jumped. She swung out over the hall and let go as soon as she was straight up and down, landing crooked and falling as her right leg crumpled. It hurt, but she hardly felt it, scrambling on hands and knees to get out of the way, staring up at the hole...... and there was Claire, her head coming out, her wide, worried eyes taking in that she was okay, that the hall was empty and safe... except that there were bells ringing and a woman on an intercom was talking, and Mr. X was coming. Claire stretched her arm down as far as she could with the gun. \"Sherry, I need you to hold this, I can\u0027t turn around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry stood and reached up, grabbing the barrel, amazed at how heavy the gun was as Claire let go. \"Don\u0027t point it at anything,\" Claire breathed, and then she actually dove out of the hole, curling her body and landing on her shoulder, her head tucked in tight. She did a half-somersault and then her legs banged into the concrete wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Sherry could even ask if she was all right, Claire was on her feet, taking the gun and pointing to the door at the end of the hall. \"Run!\" she said, and started to run herself, one hand pushing on Sherry\u0027s back as they sprinted for the door, as the intercom voice told them to get out, told them that a self-destruct sequence had been activated...... and behind them, a sound of crashing metal tore through the blaring noise of the sirens, and Sherry ran faster, terrified. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3/page-28.html","bookId":2458,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:31:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:31:42 PM"}
