I need calm. I took a deep breath, relaxed into the mattress and closed my eyes once again, conjuring up images of Carter from this morning ― Carter’s eyes, Carter’s mouth, Carter’s wet, warm tongue dipping between my br**sts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that didn\u0027t happen. But this was a diddling daydream and I could make daydream-Carter lick me if I wanted to. And I wanted to. I wanted him to lick and suck on my neck. I wanted him to lick and suck on my ni**les. I wanted him to lick and suck a trail down my stomach and sink his mouth between my legs. My hand holding the bullet followed the same path Carter’s mouth did in my mind, until the tiny vibrating tube rested right outside of my underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. Okay, this is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the bullet a little harder against myself and my hips jerked forward as tiny pin-pricks of pleasure shot through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, God….\" I mumbled, along with a few other incoherent words of shock and awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hips rocked against the vibrator and I let out a small, whimpered moan at how good this felt. This was insane. I was not going to last more than a minute with this thing. I could feel the wetness in my underwear and the throbbing all through my sex and suddenly I wanted more than anything to feel the cold, smooth metallic toy directly against my bare skin. Faster than I\u0027ve ever moved, I slid the bullet away and up to my stomach and pushed it and my hand beneath my underwear, quickly shoving it back where it belonged. As soon as the vibrations and the smooth metal came in direct contact with the bareness between my legs, a loud moan escaped from my lips, my head flew back and my eyes squeezed shut. With this thing pulsating between my legs, I didn\u0027t really need images of Carter, but I still wanted them. I pictured his smooth fingers pushing into me, his lips pulling my nipple into his mouth and his thumb rubbing circles around the very sensitive area the bullet currently touched. The sensations were almost too much and I cried out in surprise, arching my back as the first wave of an orgasm rocked through my core while I rubbed the bullet quickly against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy hell,\" I moaned as I rode wave after wave of pleasure that made my toes curl. I was panting from my release and the energy slowly drained out of me but my hands still slid the bullet through my wetness and rubbed it quickly against my overly sensitive clit out of their own accord. Before I could even form a coherent thought, another orgasm, slightly less intense than the first, pulsed through me and put a stop to all of my movements. My mouth was open but no sound came out as I held my breath and felt the intense throb of my release pound through me. Several minutes passed before my brain started to function again. I yanked the bullet out of my underwear before I had a chance to and turn into one of those crazy nut jobs on the show “My Strange Addiction” who locked herself in her room and did nothing but masturbate and watch the Food Network all day. I quickly shut the vibrator off, the sudden lack of a buzzing sound making the room seem eerily quiet all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid there like a slug in the bed, unable to lift any of my limbs for several minutes while my eyelids drooped with fatigue. When I finally recovered the use of my arms, I reached over to the nightstand without sitting up, grabbed my cell phone and started a new text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullet Bitch: Homework assignment completed. My vagina will never be the same. ~ Claire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door shook me from my thoughts. Okay, maybe not thoughts, catatonic state might have been more accurate. I’d done nothing but go to work and stare at the empty walls in my house for two days since Claire dropped the bomb on me. I shuffled morosely over to the door and threw it open. Drew stood there wearing a black shirt that said \"Alice in Chains\" with a picture of Alice from the Brady Bunch wearing a ball gag, handcuffs and chains. He smiled and held up a six-pack of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sober man enters, drunk man leaves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut the door in his face and walked back over to my spot on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reopened the door himself and walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, Mary, there\u0027s no need to act like a baby,\" he said as he set the beer on the coffee table and flopped down on the couch next to me. My nose curled up in disgust at the smell coming from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Drew, what the f**k is that smell?\" I moaned as I covered my nose with my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be a hater. I picked it up today. It\u0027s Tim McGraw\u0027s cologne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it\u0027s Tim McGraw\u0027s balls. That smells like pure cat piss dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you,\" Drew grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks. The smell of piss does nothing for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew huffed and crossed his arms over his chest and stared me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, out with it. Before I run to the store and buy you Midol and tampons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head fell to the back of the couch. I knew I was being a little bitch but I couldn\u0027t help it. My world just blew up in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has a kid. I\u0027m somebody\u0027s dad,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I got that already from the voicemail you left me last night. Although, I have to say, trying to decipher “Bruce Willis got her pregnant with my chocolate hairy balls at the frat party” took some time to figure out. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of Jim and Liz since you wouldn\u0027t answer my calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell am I going to do?\" I asked him as I lifted my head up to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First of all, you\u0027re going to talk to her and get the whole story. I know you\u0027re in shock but sitting around here all day fingering your vagina isn\u0027t going to make anything better. So man-up. Go talk to her. You spent all these years trying to find her and here she is, right in front of you. So she\u0027s got a little baggage. Who doesn\u0027t?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-41.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
