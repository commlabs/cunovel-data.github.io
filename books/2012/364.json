I don’t want to hear her laughing. I don’t want to look into her eyes and see the fires of Telas .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been seen, and now the warrior-beasts under them were shifting their approach, angling towards a small party that had ridden out to one side. Prince Beddict. Aranict. Queen Abrastal and Spax, and three people he’d not seen before – two women and a tall, ungainly-looking man with a long face. Just behind this group, standing alone and impossibly tall, was a woman shrouded in a cloak of rabbit-skins, down to her ankles, her hair a wild, tangled mane of brown, her face looking like it had been carved from sandstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thumping gait of the Ve’Gath fell off as they drew nearer. Glancing down, Grub saw that the armour formed a high collar up past his hips, flaring out just beneath his ribs. And behind his back, an upthrust of overlapping scales formed a kind of back-rest, protecting his spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe K’Chain Che’Malle halted, and Grub saw Brys Beddict studying Krughava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are a most welcome sight, Mortal Sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where are my Perish positioned?’ Krughava demanded in a voice like grating gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Abrastal replied. ‘Centre, nearest line of defences and a little way past that. Mortal Sword, their position is untenable – they are provided no avenues of retreat. With a little pushing, we can attack them on three sides.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrughava grunted. ‘We are meant to maul ourselves on this studded fist, sirs. And should they all die, my Perish, it is of little interest to the Forkrul Assail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We more or less worked that one out,’ Spax said. The Gilk Warchief was in full turtleshell armour, his face painted white, the eyes rimmed in deep red ochre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mortal Sword was momentarily silent, her gaze moving from one figure to the next, then slipping past to narrow on the huge woman standing fifteen paces back. ‘You have found new allies, Prince. Toblakai?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys glanced back, made a face. ‘Gods below, I’ve never known a woman as shy as her. She is Teblor and she commands three hundred of her kind. She is named Gillimada.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where will you place them?’ Krughava’s tone was, if anything, yet harsher than it had been a moment earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrub saw them all hesitating, and this confused him. What is wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAranict lit a new stick from her old one and flung the latter away, speaking all the while, ‘Mortal Sword, there are over forty thousand Kolansii on the other side of the valley.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Forty thousand? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We are faced with a challenge,’ Brys Beddict said. ‘We must endeavour to engage the entirety of this force, for as long as possible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Abrastal spoke. ‘Once the Pure commanding here learns of the real assault – the one upon the Spire – he will seek to withdraw as many of his troops as he can safely manage. We judge three bells to fast-march to the isthmus – in other words, they can reach that battle in time, Mortal Sword, and strike at Gesler’s flank. As yet, we can determine no way in which to prevent this happening.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will turn the Perish,’ pronounced Krughava. ‘I will pull them from their position and wheel them round, placing them to block the way east. We need only slow the enemy, sirs, not stop them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you so succeed in regaining your command of the Grey Helms,’ said Brys, ‘will you welcome the company of the Teblor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrughava’s thinned eyes switched to the Teblor commander. ‘Sirs,’ she said, loud enough for all to hear, ‘to fight alongside the Teblor would be an honour unsurpassed on this day.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrub sought to see the effect of these words, but from Gillimada there was no reaction at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mortal Sword,’ said Queen Abrastal, ‘are you confident that you can resume command of the Grey Helms? And before you answer, this is not the time for unrealistic bravado.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrughava stiffened at that. ‘Do you imagine that I do not understand the severity of this moment, Highness? I will speak plainly. I do not know if I will succeed. But I will give my life in the effort – would you ask more of me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We must, however,’ said Brys, ‘present ourselves to the enemy in such a manner as to deal with either eventuality.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud voice suddenly boomed, ‘They talk bad!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillimada was suddenly among them, her eyes level with the mounted men and women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excuse me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fixed the prince with her gaze, her brow fiercely knotted. ‘The fish-faces. They use words that hurt. If this fight goes bad, the fish-face will speak, and make us kneel. Make us kill our own anger. You – you must be stubborn! You must say no and shake your heads no! You must see the fish-face in your head, and then you must push him or her to the ground, and then you must squat, and then you must shit on that fish-face! I have spoken!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-364.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
