{"id":88710,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eHow long since he\u0027d identified with humans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had all stopped the day he stopped being human himself. Not at the moment he\u0027d stopped being\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman, though. At first all his anger had been for Hunter Redfern....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaking up from the dead was an experience you don\u0027t forget. For Quinn, it happened in the Redfern\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecabin on a husk mattress in front of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes to see three beautiful girls leaning over him. Garnet, with her wine-colored hair\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshining in the ruby light, Lily with her black hair and her eyes like topaz, and Dove, his own Dove,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrown-haired and gentle, with anxious love in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Hunter informed him that he\u0027d been dead for three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told your father you\u0027d gone to Plymouth; don\u0027t tell him otherwise. And don\u0027t try to move yet; you\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoo weak. We\u0027ll bring in something soon and you can feed.\" He stood behind his daughters, his arms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound them, all of them looking down at Quinn. \"Be happy. You\u0027re one of us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all Quinn felt was horror-and pain. When he put his thumbs to his teeth, he found the source of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epain. His canine teeth were as long as a wildcat\u0027s and they throbbed at the slightest touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a monster. An unholy creature who needed blood to survive. Hunter Redfern had been telling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe truth about his family, and he\u0027d changed Quinn into one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsane with fury, Quinn jumped up and tried to get his hands around Hunter\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hunter just laughed, fending off the attack easily. The next thing Quinn knew, he was running down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe blazed trail in the forest, heading for his father\u0027s house. Staggering and stumbling down the trail,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erather. He was almost too weak to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen suddenly Dove was beside him. Little Dove who looked as if she couldn\u0027t outrun a flower. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esteadied him, held him up, and tried to convince him to go back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Quinn could only think of one thing: getting to his father. His father was a minister; his father would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow what to do. His father would help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Dove, at last, agreed to go with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater Quinn would realize that of course he should have known better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached Quinn\u0027s home. At that point, if Quinn was afraid of anything, it was that his father wouldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelieve this wild story of bloodthirst and death. But one look at Quinn\u0027s new teeth convinced his father of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could recognize a devil when he saw one, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he knew his duty. Like every Puritan\u0027s, it was to cast out sin and evil wherever he found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, his father picked up a brand from the fire-a good piece of seasoned pine-and then grabbed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDove by the hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was around this time that the screaming started, the screaming Quinn would be able to hear forever\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafter if he listened. Dove was too gentle to put up much of a fight. And Quinn himself was too weak to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esave her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried. He threw himself on top of Dove to shield her from the stake. He would always have the scar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon his side to prove it. But the wood that nicked him pierced Dove to the heart. She died looking up at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim, the light in her brown eyes going out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen everything was confusion, with his father chasing him, crying, brandishing the bloody stake pulled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom Dove\u0027s body. It ended when Hunter Red-fern appeared at the door with Lily and Garnet. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etook Quinn and Dove home with them, while Quinn\u0027s father went running to the neighbors for help. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewanted help burning the Redfern cabin down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Hunter said it, the thing that severed Quinn\u0027s ties with his old world. He looked down at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis dead daughter and said, \"She was too gentle to live in a world full of humans. Do you think you can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo any better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Quinn, dazed and starving, so frightened and full of horror that he couldn\u0027t talk, decided then that he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould. Humans were the enemy. No matter what he did, they would never accept him. He had become\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething they could only hate-so he might as well become it thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, you don\u0027t have a family anymore,\" Hunter mused. \"Unless it\u0027s the Redferns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then, Quinn had thought of himself only as a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, feeling clearer than he had for days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl had disturbed him. The girl in the cellar, the girl whose face he had never seen. For two days\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafter that night, all he could think of was somehow finding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened between them... well, he still didn\u0027t understand that. If she had been a witch, he\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave thought she bewitched him. But she was human. And she\u0027d made him doubt everything he knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d awakened feelings that had been sleeping since Dove died in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now... now he thought it was just as well he hadn\u0027t been able to find her. Because the cellar girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t just human, she was a vampire hunter. Like his father. His father, who, wild-eyed and sobbing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad driven the stake through Dove\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, Quinn felt himself losing his grip on sanity as he remembered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a pity that he\u0027d have to kill the cellar girl the next time he saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no help for it. Vampire hunters were worse than the ordinary human vermin, who were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust stupid. Vampire hunters were the sin and the evil that had to be cast out. The Night World was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I haven\u0027t been to the dub in a week, Quinn thought, showing his teeth. He laughed out loud, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrange and brittle sound. Well, I guess I\u0027d better go tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all part of the great dance, you see, he thought to the cellar girl, who of course couldn\u0027t hear him. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edance of life and death. The dance that\u0027s going on right this minute all over the world, in African savannas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Arctic snowfields and the bushes in Boston Common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling and eating. Hunting and dying. A spider snags a bluebottle fly; a polar bear grabs a seal. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoyote springs on a rabbit. It\u0027s the way the world has always been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans were part of it, too, except that they let slaughterhouses do the killing for them and received\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir prey in the form of McDonald\u0027s hamburgers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an order to things. The dance required\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat someone be the hunter and someone else be the hunted. With all those young girls longing to offer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethemselves to the darkness, it would be cruel of Quinn not to provide a darkness to oblige them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all only playing their parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn headed for the club, laughing in a way that scared even him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe club was only a few streets away from the warehouse, Rashel noted. Made sense. Everything about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis operation had the stamp of efficiency, and she sensed Quinn\u0027s hand in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what he\u0027s getting paid to provide the girls for sale? she thought. She\u0027d heard that Quinn liked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, once we get inside, you don\u0027t know me,\" she said to Daphne. \"It\u0027s safer for both of us that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway. They might suspect something if they knew that first you escaped and now you\u0027re turning up with a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it.\" Daphne looked excited and a little scared. Under her coat, she was wearing a slinky black top\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand a brief skirt, and her black-stockinged legs twinkled as she ran toward the club door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Rashel\u0027s coat, hidden in the lining, was a knife. Like her sword, it was made of lignum vitae, the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehardest wood on earth. The sheath had several interesting secret compartments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the knife of a ninja, and Sensei, who had taught Rashel the martial arts, wouldn\u0027t have approved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat all. He wouldn\u0027t have approved of Rashel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade it in, too, her story must have passed inspection. That was a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the place looked like hell. Not a shambles. It literally looked like Hell. Hades. The Underworld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights turned it into a place of infernal fire and twisting purple shadows. The music was weird and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edissonant and sounded to Rashel as if it were being played backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught scraps of conversation as she walked across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... going out Dumpster diving later...\" \"... no money. So I gotta jack somebody...\" \"... told Mummy I\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe at the key-dub meeting...\" You get a real cross section here, she thought dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody had one thing in common, though; they were young. Kids. The oldest looked about eighteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngest-well, there were a few girls Rashel would put at twelve. She had an impulse to go back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand insert something wooden into Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow fire that had started in her chest when she first heard about the Crypt was burning hotter and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehotter with everything she saw here. This entire place is a snare, a gigantic Venus\u0027 flytrap, she thought as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe took off her coat and added it to a pile on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if she wanted to shut it down, she had to stay cool, stick to her plan. Standing by a cast-iron column,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe scanned the room for vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there, standing with a little group that in-duded Daphne, was Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave Rashel an odd shock to see him, and she wanted to look away. She couldn\u0027t. He was laughing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand somehow that caught hold of her like a fishhook. For a moment the morbid lighting of the room\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed rainbow-colored in the radiance shed by that laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppalled, Rashel realized that her face had flushed and her heart was beating fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate him, she thought, and this was true. She did hate him for what he was doing to her. He made her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeel unmoored and adrift. Confused. Helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood why those girls were clustered around him, longing to fling themselves into his darkness\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike a bunch of virgin sacrifices jumping into a volcano. I mean, what else do you do with a guy like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill him. It would be the only solution even if he weren\u0027t a vampire, she decided with sudden insane\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echeer. Because prolonged contact with that smile was obviously going to annihilate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel blinked rapidly, getting a grip on herself. All right. Concentrate on that, on the job to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to have to kill him, but not now; right now she had to get herself chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking carefully on her heels, she went over to join Quinn\u0027s group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t see her at first. He was facing Daphne and a couple of other girls, laughing frequently- too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrequently. He looked wild and a little feverish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto Rashel. A sort of devilish Mad Hatter at an insane tea party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... and I just felt so totally awful that I didn\u0027t get to meet you,\" Daphne was saying, \"and I just wish I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew what happened, because it was just so seriously weird...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was telling her story, Rashel realized. At least none of the people listening seemed openly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen you here before,\" came a voice behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt belonged to a striking girl with dark hair, very pale skin, and eyes like amber or topaz... or a hawk\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel froze, every muscle tensing, trying to keep her face expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sure of it. The camellia-petal skin, the light in the eyes... this must be the girl vampire who\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrought Daphne food in the warehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is my first time,\" Rashel said, making her voice light and eager. \"My name\u0027s Shelly.\" It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclose enough to her own name that she would turn automatically if anyone said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Lily.\" The girl said it without warmth, and those hawklike eyes continued to bore straight into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel had to struggle to stay on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Lily Redfern, she thought, working desperately to keep an idiot smile plastered on her face. I know it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis. How many Lily\u0027s can there be who\u0027d be working with Quinn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got a Redfern right here in front of me. I\u0027ve got Hunter Redfern\u0027s daughter here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant she was tempted to simply make a dash for her knife. Killing a celebrity like Lily seemed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealmost worth giving up the enclave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the other hand, Hunter Redfern was a moderate sort of vampire, with a lot of influence on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World Council. He helped keep other vampires in line. Striking at him through his daughter would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust make him mad, and then he might start listening to the Councilors who wanted to slaughter humans in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edroves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rashel would lose any hope of getting at the heart of the slave trade, where the real scum were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate politics, Rashel thought. But she was already beaming at Lily, prattling for all she was worth. \"It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas my friend Marnie who told me about this place, and I\u0027m really glad I came because it\u0027s even better\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethan I thought, and I\u0027ve got this poem I wrote-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really. Well, I\u0027m dying not to hear it,\" Lily said. Her hawklike eyes had lost interest. Her face was filled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith open contempt-she\u0027d dismissed Rashel as a hopeless fawning idiot. She walked away without\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eglancing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo tests passed. One to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I like about Lily. She\u0027s just so absolutely cold,\" a girl beside Rashel said. She had wavy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebronze hair and bee-stung lips. \"Hi, I\u0027m Juanita,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027s serious, Rashel thought as she introduced herself. Quinn\u0027s group had noticed her at last, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey all seemed to agree with Juanita. They were fascinated by Lily\u0027s cold personality, her lack of feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw it as strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, because feeling hurts. Maybe I should worship her, too, Rashel thought.
