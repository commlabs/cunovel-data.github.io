In-tolerance produces war and looks indifferently upon intolerable conditions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLove cannot be indifferent. It does not know how.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe fastest way to get to a place of love and concern for all humankind is to see all humankind as your family.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe fastest way to see all humankind as your family is to stop separating yourself.

In this dialogue, you tell me what your new choices are, and I offer observations on ways to manifest that.

The “haves” will never surrender their sovereignty, wealth, and resources to the “have-nots.” And, argumentatively, why should they?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause it is in their best interest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey don’t see that—and I’m not sure I do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you could add billions of dollars a year to your nation’s economy—dollars which could be spent to feed the hungry, clothe the needy, house the poor, bring security to the elderly, provide better health, and produce a dignified standard of living for all—wouldn’t that be in your nation’s best interest?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, in America there are those who would argue that it would help the poor at the expense of the rich and of the middle-income taxpayer. Meanwhile, the country continues to go to hell, crime ravages the nation, inflation robs the people of their life savings, unemployment skyrockets, the government grows bigger and fatter, and in school they’re handing out condoms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou sound like a radio talk show.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, these are the concerns of many Americans.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen they are short-sighted. Do you not see that if billions of dollars a year—that’s millions a month, hun-dreds and hundreds of thousands a week, unheard of amounts each day-could be sunk back into your system\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethat if you could use these monies to feed your hungry, clothe your needy, house your poor, bring security to your elderly, and provide health care and dignity to all ... the causes of crime would be lost forever? Do you not see that new jobs would mushroom as dollars were pumped back into your economy?

Taxes imposed by Your new world government? More taking from those who’ve “worked to get it” to give to those who won’t “stand upon their own two feet” and go after it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs that how you frame it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, but it is how a great many people see it, and I wanted to fairly state their view.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I’d like to talk about that later. Right now I don’t want to get off track—but I want to come back to that later.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGreat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut you’ve asked where these new dollars would come from. Well, they would not have to come from any new taxes imposed by the new world community (al-though members of the community—individual citi-zens— would want, under an enlightened governance, to send 10 percent of their income to provide for society’s needs as a whole). Nor would they come from new taxes imposed by any local government. In fact, some local governments would surely be able to reduce taxes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of this—all of these benefits—would result from the simple restructuring of your world view, the simpler reordering of your world political configuration.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe money you save from building defense systems and attack weapons.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, I get it!

Everybody in the world.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut not close down your military, simply reduce it—drastically. Internal order would be your only need. You could strengthen local police—something you say you want to do, but cry each year at budget time that you cannot do—at the same time dramatically reducing your spending on weapons of war and preparations for war; that is, offensive and defensive weapons of mass destruction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I think Your figures exaggerate how much could be saved by doing that. Second, I don’t think You’ll ever convince people they should give up their ability to defend themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eThe nations that are spending the most could redi-rect the most to the other priorities mentioned. So larger, richer nations would see it in their best interests to do so—if they thought it was possible. But larger, richer nations cannot imagine going defenseless, for they fear aggression and attack from the nations which envy them and want what they have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are two ways to eliminate this threat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e1. Share enough of the world’s total wealth and resources with all of the world’s people so that no one will want and need what someone else has, and every-one may live in dignity and remove themselves from fear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e2. Create a system for the resolution of differences that eliminates the need for war—and even the possi-bility of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe people of the world would probably never do this. They already have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey have?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. There is a great experiment now going on in your world in just this sort of political order. That experiment is called the United States of America.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhich You said was failing miserably.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is. It has very far to go before it could be called a success. (As I promised earlier, I’ll talk about this—and the attitudes which are now preventing it—later.) Still, it is the best experiment going.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is as Winston Churchill said. “Democracy is the worst system,” he announced, “except all others.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour nation was the first to take a loose confedera-tion of individual states and successfully unite them into a cohesive group, each submitting to one central authority.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the time, none of the states wanted to do this, and each resisted mightily, fearing the loss of its individ-ual greatness and claiming that such a union would not serve its best interests.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt may be instructive to understand just what was going on with these individual states at that time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhile they had joined together in a loose confed-eration, there was no real U.S. Government, and hence no power to enforce the Articles of Confederation to which the states had agreed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStates were conducting their own foreign affairs, several reaching private agreements on trade and other matters with France, Spain, England, and other coun-tries. States traded with each other as well, and although their Articles of Confederation forbade it, some states added tariffs to the goods shipped in from other states—just as they did for goods from across the ocean! Merchants had no choice but to pay at the harbor if they wanted to buy or sell their goods, there being no central authority—although there was a written agree-ment to prohibit such taxing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe individual states also fought wars with each other. Each state considered its militia a standing army, nine states had their own navies, and “Don’t tread on me” could have been the official motto of every state in the Confederation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOver half of the states were even printing their own money. (Although the Confederation had agreed that doing so would also be illegal!)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn short, your original states, though joined together under the Articles of Confederation, were acting exactly as independent nations do today.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they could see that the agreements of their Confederation (such as the granting to Congress the sole authority to coin money) were not working, they staunchly resisted creating and submitting to a central authority that could enforce these agreements and put some teeth into them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet, in time, a few progressive leaders began to prevail. They convinced the rank and file that there was more to be gained by creating such a new Federation than they would ever lose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMerchants would save money and increase profits because individual states could no longer tax each other’s goods.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGovernments would save money and have more to put into programs and services that truly helped people because resources would not have to be used to protect individual states from each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe people would have greater security and safety, and greater prosperity, too, by cooperating with, rather than fighting with, each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFar from losing their greatness, each state could become greater still.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, of course, is exactly what has happened. The same could be made to happen with the 160\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003enation states in the world today if they were to join together in a United Federation. It could mean an end to war.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow so? There would still be disagreements.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo long as humans remain attached to outer things, that is true. There is a way to truly eliminate war—and all experience of unrest and lack of peace-but that is a spiritual solution. We are here exploring a geopolitical one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eActually, the trick is to combine the two. Spiritual truth must be lived in practical life to change everyday experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUntil this change occurs, there would still be dis-agreements. You are right. Yet there need not be wars. There need not be killing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre there wars between California and Oregon over water rights? Between Maryland and Virginia over fish-ing? Between Wisconsin and Illinois, Ohio and Massa-chusetts?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd why not? Have not various disputes and differ-ences arisen between them?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThrough the years, I suppose so.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can bet on it. But these individual states have voluntarily agreed—it was a simple, voluntary agree-ment—to abide by certain laws and abide by certain compromises on matters common to them, while re-taining the right to pass separate statutes on matters relating to each individually.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd when disputes between states do arise, due to differing interpretations of the federal law-or someone simply breaking that law—the matter is taken to a court ... which has been granted the authority (that is, given the authority by the states) to resolve the dispute.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, if the current body of law does not provide a precedent or a means by which the matter can be brought through the courts to a satisfactory resolution, the states and the people in them send their repre-sentatives to a central government to try to create agreement on new laws that will produce a satisfactory circumstance—or, at the very least, a reasonable com-promise.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is how your federation works. A system of laws, a system of courts empowered by you to interpret those laws, and a justice system—backed by armed might, if needed—to enforce the decisions of those courts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough no one could argue that the system doesn’t need improving, this political concoction has worked for more than 200 years!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is no reason to doubt that the same recipe will work between nation states as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf this is so simple, why hasn’t it been tried?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt has. Your League of Nations was an early attempt. The United Nations is the latest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet one failed and the other has been only minimally effective because—like the 13 States of America’s origi-nal Confederation—the member nation states (particu-larly the most powerful) are afraid they have more to lose than to gain from the reconfiguration.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is because the “people of power” are more concerned with holding on to their power than with improving the quality of life for all people. The “Haves” know that such a World Federation would inevitably produce more for the “have-nots”—but the “haves” believe this would come at their expense... and they’re giving up nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIsn’t their fear justified—and is wanting to hold on to what you have so long struggled for unreasonable?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, it is not necessarily true that, to give more to those who now hunger and thirst and live without shelter, others must give up their abundance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs I have pointed out, all you would have to do is take the $1 ,000,000,000,000 a year spent annually worldwide for military purposes and shift that to hu-manitarian purposes, and you will have solved the problem without spending an additional penny or shift-ing any of the wealth from where it now resides to where it does not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e(Of course, it could be argued that those interna-tional conglomerates whose profits come from war and tools for war would be “losers”—as would their employ-ees and all those whose abundance is derived from the world’s conflict consciousness—but perhaps your source of abundance is misplaced. If one has to depend on the world living in strife in order for one to survive, perhaps this dependence explains why your world resists any attempt to create a structure for lasting peace.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for the second part of your question, wanting to hold on to what you have struggled so long to acquire, as an individual or as a nation, is not unreasonable, if you come from an Outside World consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA what?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you derive your life’s greatest happiness from experiences obtainable only in the Outside World—the physical world outside of yourself—you will never want to give up an ounce of all that you’ve piled up, as a person and a nation, to make you happy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd as long as those who “have not” see their unhappiness tied to the lack of material things, they, too, will get caught in the trap. They will constantly want what you have got, and you will constantly refuse to share it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is why I said earlier that there is a way to truly eliminate war—and all experience of unrest and lack of peace. But this is a spiritual solution.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, every geopolitical problem, just as every personal problem, breaks down to a spiritual problem.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of life is spiritual, and therefore all of life’s prob-lems are spiritually based—and spiritually solved.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWars are created on your planet because somebody has something that somebody else wants. This is what causes someone to do something that somebody else does not want them to do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll conflict arises from misplaced desire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe only peace in all the world that is sustaining is Internal Peace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet each person find peace within. When you find peace within, you also find that you can do without.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis means simply that you no longer need the things of your outside world. “Not needing” is a great freedom. It frees you, first, from fear: fear that there is something you won’t have; fear that there is something you have that you will lose; and fear that without a certain thing, you won’t be happy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, “not needing” frees you from anger. An-ger is fear announced. When you have nothing to fear, you have nothing over which to be angry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are not angry when you don’t get what you want, because your wanting it was simply a prefer-ence, not a necessity. You therefore have no fear associated with the possibility of not getting it. Hence, no anger.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are not angry when you see others doing what you don’t want them to do, because you don’t need them to do or not do any particular thing. Hence, no anger.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are not angry when someone is unkind, be-cause you have no need for them to be kind. You have no anger when someone is unloving, because you have no need for them to love you. You have no anger when someone is cruel, or hurtful, or seeks to damage you, for you have no need for them to behave any other way, and you are clear that you cannot be damaged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou do not even have anger should someone seek to take your life, because you do not fear death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen fear is taken from you, all else can be taken from you and you will not be angry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou know inwardly, intuitively, that everything you’ve created can be created again, or—more impor-tantly—that it doesn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you find Inner Peace, neither the presence nor the absence of any person, place or thing, condi-tion, circumstance, or situation can be the Creator of your state of mind or the cause of your experience of being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis does not mean that you reject all things of the body. Far from it. You experience being fully in your body and the delights of that, as you never have before.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet your involvement with things of the body will be voluntary, not mandatory. You will experience bodily sensations because you choose to, not because your are required to in order to feel happy or to justify sadness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis one simple change—seeking and finding peace within—could, were it undertaken by everyone, end all wars, eliminate conflict, prevent injustice, and bring the world to everlasting peace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is no other formula necessary, or possible. World peace is a personal thing!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat is needed is not a change of circumstance, but a change of consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow can we find inner peace when we are hungry? Be at a place of serenity when we thirst? Remain calm when we are wet and cold and without shelter? Or avoid anger when our loved ones are dying without cause?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou speak so poetically, but is poetry practical? Does it have anything to say to the mother in Ethiopia who watches her emaciated child die for lack of one slice of bread? The man in Central America who feels a bullet rip his body because he tried to stop an army from taking over his village? And what does your poetry say to the woman in Brooklyn raped eight times by a gang? Or the family of six in Ireland blown away by a terrorist bomb planted in a church on a Sunday morning?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is difficult to hear, but I tell you this: There is perfection in everything. Strive to see the perfection. This is the change of consciousness of which I speak.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNeed nothing. Desire everything. Choose what shows up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFeel your feelings. Cry your cries. Laugh your laughs. Honor your truth. Yet when all the emotion is done, be still and know that I am God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, in the midst of the greatest tragedy, see the glory of the process. Even as you die with a bullet through your chest, even as you are being gang-raped.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow this sounds like such an impossible thing to do. Yet when you move to God consciousness, you can do it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to do it, of course. It depends on how you wish to experience the moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn a moment of great tragedy, the challenge always is to quiet the mind and move deep within the soul.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou automatically do this when you have no control over it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever talked with a person who acciden-tally ran a car off a bridge? Or found himself facing a gun? Or nearly drowned? Often they will tell you that time slowed way down, that they were overcome by a curious calm, that there was no fear at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Fear not, for I am with you.” That is what poetry has to say to the person facing tragedy. In your darkest hour, I will be your light. In your blackest moment, I will be your consolation. In your most difficult and trying\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etime, I will be your strength. Therefore, have faith! For I am your shepherd; you shall not want. I will cause you to lie down in green pastures; I will lead you beside still waters.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI will restore your soul, and lead you in the paths of righteousness for My Name’s sake.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yea, though you walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death, you will fear no evil; for I am with you. My rod and My staff will comfort you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am preparing a table before you in the presence of your enemies. I shall anoint your head with oil. Your cup will run over.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSurely, goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life, and you will dwell in My house—and in My heart—forever.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/611.html","bookId":36,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:45:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:45:34 AM"}
