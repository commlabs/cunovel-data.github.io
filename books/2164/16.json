One moment he was there; the next, gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA narrow passageway stretched before her, lined on each side by sheer walls of rock. A gray mist crawled over the ground. Her skin went gooseflesh from the chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nothing for it, she walked forward. She felt as though she was covering leagues with each step, taking days to draw each breath. She pressed on, waiting for the Reaver to show itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter only a few moments, whispers sounded in her head, then hisses, pained wails. She could not see the source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hairs on the back of her neck rose. Her breath came fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was behind her! She knew it with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her morningstar and turned around slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mere five paces away, the misty, serpentine form of the Soulreaver filled the passage. Its empty eyes reduced her to insignificance. Its open mouth could have swallowed an ogre whole. Deep in its throat, in its bowels, glowed innumerable souls, as tiny as the dolls of a child, as desperate and pained as victims of a torturemaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae struggled to find herself, t o show no fear. She knew she faced another test of her worthiness. She touched her holy symbol, and the amber felt cool in her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reaver was so immense, so ancient, so terrible....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams of the souls filled her mind. She bore it, though she wanted to dig a furrow in her skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reaver opened its mouth wider, simultaneously beckoning and challenging her to come forward, to test herself against what it would show her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started forward on leaden legs but stopped after only two steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae gestured it toward her and said in her most seductivewhisper, \"You come to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not hesitate. Mouth agape, it streaked at her, terrifyingly fast. She held her ground as its maw engulfed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thousand muttering voices, terrified, hopeless voicesthe voices of the trapped soulsrang in her ears, sounded in her being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answered their scream with one of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnival, First Daughter to the Matron Mother of House Agrach Dyrr, watched from high atop one of the walls as the Xorlarrin forces shifted their ranks in preparation for an assault. She could see little. Strategically placed spheres of magical darkness shielded much of the movement. Shouted commands and the ring of metal carried across the moat chasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding beside her, Urgan, the scarred weapons master of House Agrach Dyrr, said, \"They will attack within the hour, Mistress Anival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnival nodded. She put her hands to the hafts of the two enchanted light maces that hung from her belt. Each sported a head fashioned in the shape of a spider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The timing is not coincidental,\" she said but did not explain. She assumed the attack to be designed to protect the archmage. His allies surely knew that the matron mother had learned of his deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnival looked up and down the line, at walls of adamantine and stone. They had stood for millennia. Surely they would not fall now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrrsolders lined the battlements, and Anival could see from their hard expressions that all of them sensed the impending attack. A tense rustle rippled through the ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will hold,\" Anival said, speaking to herself as much as to Urgan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weapons master said, \"We will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnival thought she heard doubt in Urgan\u0027s tone but let it pass. She wondered whether she should hope for her mother\u0027s success or failure in stopping the archmage. If the matron mother died and the lichdrow\u0027s phylactery was destroyed, Anival mightmightbe able to negotiate an end to the siege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first, she needed to hold her walls, and without either her vrocks, or her House wizards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXorlarrin war trumpets sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here they come,\" Urgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of the spider golem\u0027s forelegs ended in a sharp claw of jet as long as a short sword. Its mandibles churned with fangs as long as Gromph\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph did not care. Transformed into a skilled warrior by the power of his spell, he charged straight at the golem\u0027s front, axe held high in both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golem crouched at his approach, and two claws lashed out in rapid succession before Gromph got within reach. Anticipating the move, Gromph spun aside and partially parried one blow with his axe. The other claw struck at one of the mirror images, hit it, and caused it to vanish with a pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the force of his spin to add momentum to his swing, Gromph whirled in close, slashed with the duergar axe, and cut a wedge of jet from the construct\u0027s thorax. With his spell-augmented speed, he followed up with another, cleaving a furrow in one leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spider leaped backwardcrushing a bench under its weightand struck at Gromph with one claw, then another. Gromph ducked and dodged, trying again to get in close. Two more images vanished. The construct moved with astounding rapidity, despite its weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, the two circled, a few paces apart. The golem stepped over the benches, cracking stone as it moved, waving its pedipalps hypnotically. Its clawed feet thumped into the floor with each step. Gromph followed it with his eyes, light on the balls of his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom against the temple doors turned Gromph\u0027s head. Someone was trying to get through his holding spell. Yasraena had located him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing his distraction, the golem lunged at him, knocking over benches in its haste. Gromph dived aside and rolled. Claws thumped into the ground around himone, then another, and anotherand three images vanished in rapid succession. A claw nicked his shoulder, drawing blood. His ring began to heal the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph leaped to his feet and intercepted a decapitating claw strike with his axe. The parry severed one of the golem\u0027s legs, and a shaft of jet as large as an ogre\u0027s arm crashed into a nearby bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother boom against the door. His spell held but Gromph had little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodging first one blow, then another, he darted inside the golem\u0027s reach and struck at its head with his axe. He cut a sliver from it, but it backed off, toppling benches. Gromph pressed but the creature responded by exhaling a cloud of black mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcid, Gromph realized, but could not avoid it. The personal wards that would have protected his own body did not protect Larikal\u0027s. Agony lit his skin. His nonmagical clothes disintegratedwhich thankfully didn\u0027t include the enchanted robe in which he carried his essential spell componentsand his exposed flesh burned and blistered as the mist sloughed away flesh. The stone of the floor and surrounding pews smoked and pitted. An acrid stink filled the air as the cloud dissipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph gritted his teeth against the pain, leaped over an acid-slicked pew, and struck another leg from the golem. Another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golem answered with a flurry of claw strikes that drove Gromph backward and dispelled all of his images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and pus leaked from Gromph\u0027s skin. His breath came fast and heavy. The pain was slowing him. If the golem was like others of its kind, he knew it would be able to use its acid breath again after only a short time. It had but to gather more of the caustic substance within its enchanted body, and the archmage doubted he would survive a second coating of the stuff. Gromph had to destroy it first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parried another claw strike, reared his axe back and A blow from the golem hit him squarely in the chest. Only the magical shield of force and conjured armor kept the impact from splitting him open. Still, the force of the blow sent him careening backward. He stumbled, flailing, and tripped over the broken remnants of a bench. Gromph fell on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spider lurched at him, crushing the broken bench. Its mandibles opened wide. Its pedipalps reached for him. Gromph swung his axe furiously from his back, rolled, and tried to regain his feet. A claw descended for his throat, but the shield of force turned it, though the force knocked him down again. He scooted backward, found his feet, and swung his axe defensively. The golem pressed him, drew in close and snapped its jaws. The bite snagged Gromph\u0027s cloak and pulled him off balance. A claw strike knocked him to all fours, and he nearly dropped his axe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph reared up and struck a glancing blow on the golem\u0027s head, just above its eye cluster. Flecks of jet flew and the golem backed off, pedipalps waving menacingly. Gromph regained his feet and backed off a bit too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing heavily, Gromph knew that he could not waste time. Soon, the golem would be able to use its acid breath again. Soon, Yasraena and her wizards would find a way into the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vein of the master ward stuck out of the spider\u0027s abdomen like some grotesque entrail. At the end of it, Gromph knew, within the golem\u0027s body, was the phylactery. He had to press the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed off toward the altar, axe held defensively. The spider followed, clambering over broken and acid-scarred pews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph feigned a stumble and the spider pounced. The archmage dived aside, regained his feet in an instant, and unleashed a vicious downward slash that severed one of the golem\u0027s legs at the shoulder. The golem struck at Gromph with another leg as it tried to turn to face himthe blow opened the archmage\u0027s thighbut Gromph bounded between two of its remaining legs and chopped furiously. Chunks of the golem flew into the air as it clambered around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blow struck Gromph, cracking ribs and driving the breath from his lungs, but he dared not stop his attack. His ankle caught under the golem and snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStars exploded in his vision. Agony raced up his leg. Shouting, spraying spit, he continued his onslaught. His axe rose and fell, rose andfell. Pieces of the golem lay scattered about the temple like so much Darklake flotsam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an indeterminate time, Gromph became aware that the spider golem was not moving. Fueled with spell-induced ferocity, he chopped at it several more times before he was sated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he came back to himself, the pain nearly caused him to lose consciousness. The bulk of the golem lay before him, cracked and broken. Its bulk pinned his leg. Pieces of it lay all around, scattered amidst the broken benches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother boom sounded against the temple\u0027s double doors, fairly shaking the whole of the structure. Yasraena and her wizards had not yet been able to breach Gromph\u0027s holding spell. They would try the windows next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, hissing at the pain, he pried up the golem\u0027s body with the duergar axe and slid his foot free. Bone ground against bone, and the pain caused Gromph to vomit the mushrooms he had eaten in his office earlier. He did not look at the break. His ring was working to heal his wounds, but too slowly. He reached into his robeits magic had protected it from the acidic breath of the golemand extracted two healing potions, both ordinarily serving as material components to his spells. He tore their seal with his teeth and drank the warm fluid down, one after the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis ankle reknit and the gash in his thigh and shoulder closed. Even most of the acid burns healed. He sighed, tested his ankle, found it fine, and climbed atop the golem\u0027s body. There, he found his footing and straddled the point at which the rope of the master ward vanished into the golem\u0027s body. He raised the axe high and started to chop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith each swing he grew more and more eager and the light from the phylactery\u0027s dweomer grew brighter and brighter in his sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter half-a-score swings, the axe blows revealed a hollow within the spider golem\u0027s thorax. Gromph stopped, sweating, and stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, floating in the air, intertwined with the vein of the master ward, was a shimmering, fist-sized sphere of red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere turned yellow. Then green. Then violet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph watched the globe cycle through seven colors before beginning the sequence anew. In a distant way, he knew the globe for what it wasa prismatic sphere. The colors lay atop each other, alternating spheres within spheres, like the layers of a flakefungus. The lichdrow must have found a way to make a prismatic sphere permanent. He had placed his phylactery within it and placed the whole within a specially constructed golem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph knew how to bring down a prismatic sphere. Certain spells defeated certain colors. Touching certaincolors without dispelling them resulted in harm or death. He would have to defeat all of the colors to get at the phylactery within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would take time. Time he did not have. Besides, he had another problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transformative spell that had turned him into a warrior had temporarily modified his mind, closing the door on that part of him that interacted with and drew on the Weave. He knew that he could cast spells, but the knowledge that allowed him to link with the Weave was gone, temporarily crowded out by the knowledge imparted to him by the transmutation spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not end the spell early. It had to run its course. Only after it had would he be able to bring down the sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove him, a portion of the conjured stone wall before one of the temple\u0027s windows shattered, destroyed by some spell cast by one of Yasraena\u0027s wizards. The stone rained down on the temple floor. Gromph had only the wall of force between him and the forces of House Dyrr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was almost out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scrabbling sound turned him around. What he saw caused a pit to form in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of the pieces he had chopped from the golemthe legs, the chunk of thorax, the claw, the piece of abdomencracked and split. Eight legs of jet sprouted from the cracks, a pair of mandibles. The threescore chunks of golem that Gromph had left scattered around the temple had been reanimated as buds of the main golem. The battle was not over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the tenth time in the last hour, Gromph cursed the lichdrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae looked through the tiny, unglassed window of her garret in the Braeryn. Narbondel glowed red two-thirds of the way up its shaft. It was late in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae had lost track of time. For her, one day seemed much like another, one hour bled into the next. She found it easier to measure time not with Narbondel but with corpses. It had been thirty-seven corpses since Lolth had selected herDanifae could not so much as think her nameas Yor\u0027thae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Danifae had never been to Menzoberranzan before Lolth had selected her Yor\u0027thae, she had come to know it well since. And to hate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her right, far across Menzoberranzan\u0027s cavern Danifae eyed the mammoth steps of the great stairway that led up to Tier Breche. She could see it at such a distance only because of its enormous size and the violet faerie fires that illumined its steps. On the high plateau beyond the stairsinvisible to her at that distancestood Lolth\u0027s grandest temple, Arach-Tinilith, the heart of the Spider Queen\u0027s faith. Danifae had never set foot within it and never would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin Arach-Tinilith presided the bitch, Lolth\u0027s Yor\u0027thae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger still boiled in Danifae, hate without end for the Yor\u0027thae. She vented it on the males who came to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae had created her own temple to Lolth, her own Arach-Tinilith a tiny, stinking garret deep in the Braeryn. There, she spun her web and fed on her prey in Lolth\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned out of the windowher holy symbol still dangled from her neck, the amber smudged with grease and sootand looked down to the street below. Addicts haunted the alleys like sunken-eyed, dazed ghosts. Fellow whores loitered in the doorways below her, soliciting anyone and anything that passed them by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroups of filthy orcs and bugbears leered at the fallen drow females. Danifae could see that thewhores had sold their dignity along with their flesh. Not her. She served the Spider Queen still and ever would, despite the Yor\u0027thae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thick sludge of sewage and trash coated the street. \"The Stenchstreets,\" they were called, and rightly. Danifae could not but think of the whole of the Braeryn as an open sewer that she could not escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not let Danifae escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe odor of freshly emptied chamber pots carried up to the window and made Danifae wrinkle her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression felt awkward around the stiff scars that marred the left side of her face. Thinking of her disfigurement brought another flash of anger. She willed hate through the air and across the cavern to Tier Breche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had long ago given up trying to hide her scars. They were part of her, as much as her faith, as much as her hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Lolth had made her choice, the Spider Queen\u0027s resurrection had been completed and the Yor\u0027thae had come to Menzoberranzan in triumph. She had promised to usher in a new age for the Spider Queen and her worshipers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not for all of her worshipers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Yor\u0027thae had punished Danifae for her presumption, forcing her to live a houseless life, dispossessing her of almost all of her property, marring her features to make her ugly, denying her the dignity of an execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Lolth herself appeared to have turned her back on Danifae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goddess no longer granted the former battle-captive spells and instead merely haunted her dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she slept, Danifae saw visions of eight spiders, eight sets of fangs, legs, eyes, and poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite it all, Danifae refused to accept the label of apostate. She worshiped Lolth still, though she was a congregation of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor and disfigured, she sold her body to males to earn enough coin to eat. Though the Yor\u0027thae had scarred her face, men still lusted for her body and were willing to pay for its use. Danifae abhorred their touch, despised making them feel as though she were subjugated to them, but nevertheless did what she had to to survivelike any good spider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Yor\u0027thae had laughed when she\u0027d cast Danifae into squalor, thinking that a life of penury would make Danifae weak. But Danifae was a survivor, like all spiders, and her trials were but another test in a long line of tests. She had and would survive it. She would grow stronger. She could not be broken, not ever. If Danifae had learned but one tenet from Lolth\u0027s worship, from her life as a slave to Halisstra Melarn, it was that existence was a test. Always. The strong preyed on the weak and the weak suffered and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing more to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though Danifae was not the Yor\u0027thae, she refused to be weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left off the window, turned, and looked upon her sparsely furnished garret. She preferred to think of it as her web, an unassuming web, like that of the widow, within which lurked a predator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mushroom fiber pallet strewn with soiled blankets sat against the near wall. Every day, she carried the sheets to the shores of the Darklake to launder themthe routine had long ago taken on the significance of a religious ritualbut the smell of sweat and sex always lingered. She slept on the floor, refusing to take rest in the same bed that she shared with a male. A clay oil lamp sat on a stool near her bed, its tiny flame guttering in the stagnant air. In the corner stood a stone chair, upon which she hung the few articles of clothing she owned. A chamber pot and washbasin sat on opposite walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae owned nothing of significant value except her faith, her holy symbol, and the blackroot distillate that shekept in a vial at her sash. She refilled the vial every fourth tenday by giving her body to an old, half-drow apothecary who worked out of the bazaar. She had made herself immune to the poison long ago through slow exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had sunk far, she knew, much farther even than when she had been a battle-captive. But she refused to surrender her faith. Most thought her nothing more than an insane whore or a cast-off hag afflicted with grand delusions. But she was neither. She was a spider, and she was being tested, nothing more and nothing less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had failed Lolth back in the Demonweb Pitsthat was why she had not been chosen to be the Yor\u0027thaebut she would atone for that failure and someday again find favor in the Spider Queen\u0027s eight eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, Danifae murdered in Lolth\u0027s name. Every eighth client that came to her garret fell prey to her. The Spider Queen might not have been answering Danifae\u0027s prayers, but Danifae offered sacrifices nevertheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disposed of the corpses by selling them to an elderly drow fungus farmer. Danifae\u0027s prey ended up fertilizer in the mushroom fields of the Donigarten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weak fed the strong, she thought, and smiled through her scars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on her door turned her around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Fae,\" said a slurred voice from behind the door. \"Open up. I want to taste your flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae knew the voice. Heegan, the second son of a failed merchant, who always stank of pickled mushrooms and mindwine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold a moment,\" Danifae said, and the male did as he was told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeegan was number eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae pulled the vial of blackroot distillate from her pouch, daubed her finger, and coated her lips. Donning a smile, she moved to the door and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere in the hallway stood Heegan, his white hair mussed, his filthy shirt partially unbuttoned. Danifae stood two hands taller than the male. She looked at his watery, dull red eyes and thought, You are one of the weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well met, \u0027F ae,\" he said, leering at her breasts, covered only in her threadbare shift. \"Aren\u0027t we a pretty pair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dangled a pouch of coins under her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae snatched the coins and slapped him across the face. He smiled through his bleeding lip, seized her in his arms, and pressed his lips to her. His breath was foul, his excited grunts fouler. She abided, knowing that with each kiss he became more ensnared in her web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe allowed him to steer her toward the bed. He tried to lay her down but she used her superior strength to turn him around and force him down instead. He grinned drunkenly, muttering some ridiculous endearment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straddled him and he licked his lips in excitement. His hands fumbled with her shift, her sash, and she could tell from his movements that more than mindwine was clouding his mind. His hand passed over the blackroot vial and never paused, so eager was he to get at her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling into his face, she teased him for another thirty countuntil his eager expression grew confused, then alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening to me?\" he said, his speech thick and sloppy. \"What have you done to me, bitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to shove her off him but the drug had already taken hold. His strength was gone, and he managed only to paw at her shoulders. In moments, he was fully paralyzed and could only stare up at her in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed him coldly, still smiling, and began her incantation. Her voice called upon Lolth, offering the male\u0027s death for her amusement. When she finished her prayer, she put her hands on his throat and throttled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe died with bulging eyes and a wet gurgle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the weak,\" she whispered in his ear. \"And I am the spider.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/resurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-6/page-16.html","bookId":2164,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM"}
