She\u0027d tell him everything he wanted to know: Nolan\u0027s location, how she\u0027d done those things, her favorite sexual positions. Once she talked, the pleasure could begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes. Those luscious curves would belong to him until he tired of them. He\u0027d sate himself on her, make her scream and beg for more, give it to her—if he was so inclined—and then start all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he\u0027d have to figure out how to keep her there. No chains could hold her. And whether she could break his mental hold on her body or not, he was practically drooling at the thought of touching that energy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze veered to the electronic composite of her, and his blood heated, burning through him with a desire he both loved and hated. There was a way to find and capture her. Had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re as good as mine, he thought, punching a few numbers and causing her image to fade. No need to sport a hard-on for the rest of the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires are like ... cousins to my race, for lack of a better word.\" The pronouncement came from Kyrin en Arr, Mia\u0027s boyfriend or husband or whatever they called themselves. Kyrin was also Dallas\u0027s blood master, the Arcadian who\u0027d saved his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires are aliens?\" The pronouncement came from several people at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Kyrin nodded. \"They\u0027ve just been here longer than anyone else. A long time, actually. But they are the reason the rest of us knew to come over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" Mia said, exasperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet, there are hundreds of races here. I answer any questions you have for me, but unless I know what information you seek, I can\u0027t provide the answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression softened. \"Well, from now on it\u0027s safe to say I want to know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell did she find you? This vampire girl, I mean,\" Jaxon said. He was a calm, by the book (or so it had seemed) agent who never lost his temper (or so it had seemed). Then Mishka had entered his life, and the real Jaxon had come out swinging. Boy had a temper and cussed worse than Mia I-Can\u0027t-Finish-a-Sentence-with-out-Saying-Fuck Snow. No wonder Devyn liked Jaxon so damn much. \"You\u0027re not exactly in the local database.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d met her before, so she knew a wee bit about my personality. I made the mistake of going to a girl-on-girl photo shoot. Apparently she was waiting there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Say no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. Let\u0027s backtrack a little. So you\u0027ve actually met one? Other than this Bride person?\" Mia asked him. She\u0027d recently chopped her black hair to her shoulders, and the cut framed her pretty face perfectly. A devil in angel\u0027s skin, that\u0027s what she was. But she\u0027d wanted a new look to celebrate her recent promotion to commander. \"A fucking bloodsucker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, downed the last of the Scotch. \"If by met you mean bedded, then yes.\" Dallas rolled his eyes. \"Is there a race you haven\u0027t bedded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Eden Black\u0027s.\" Eden was a Rakan, and Rakans were golden from head to toe. Golden hair, golden skin, golden irises, all of which made them look like living jewelry. Rakans reportedly smelled and tasted like honey when aroused, a fact that intrigued him greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d left him—without allowing him to sample her goods—he\u0027d tried dousing a few of his lovers in honey and pretending they were Rakan, but imitation was never as tasty as the original. Imitation was also sticky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breean\u0027s a Rakan,\" Dallas said with a laugh. \"Give him a go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in question scooted back in his chair, the legs scraping against Jaxon\u0027s kitchen floor. \"No one but Macy may bed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d only recently come to Earth and hadn\u0027t yet learned the art of sarcasm. Poor guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breean, honey, they\u0027re kidding.\" Macy was pale, her hand shaky as she poured the rest of her beer down her throat. \"Now, tell us more about this... Bride, did you say? Why\u0027d she follow you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Bride.\" What was wrong with her? Normally, she was unflappable. One mention of the name Bride, however, and she\u0027d choked. Now, she couldn\u0027t stop trembling. \"I ran into her a few days ago, and maybe there\u0027s a ... small chance that I pissed her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"maybe there\u0027s a small chance\" earned him several snorts. Macy rubbed her neck in agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you feeling well?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a slight stomachache.\" She chewed her bottom lip, refusing to face him. \"I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew women and knew when they were lying, knew when they were uncomfortable and when they were hiding something. Macy was all of those. Did she know Bride, perhaps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the question drifted through his mind, he froze, another possibility taking shape. Could Macy be Bride\u0027s mysterious friend? No, surely not. But... Bride had smelled her friend on him, and Devyn had just run into Macy. Macy never wore perfume—at least, he\u0027d never noticed it on her— just as Bride had claimed her friend wouldn\u0027t. And when he\u0027d offered to describe the women he\u0027d been with, Bride had shaken her head no, as if the descriptions couldn\u0027t help her. She\u0027d needed to see them, up close and in person. Why? There was only one reason he could think of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy could change her appearance at will, one moment a luscious blonde, the next an exact replica of even the golden giant beside her. A golden giant who had paled, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone inside this kitchen knew Macy was not really Macy. She was an otherworlder posing as the human model-slash-AIR-agent. But no one knew who she really was, who she\u0027d been before taking over the dead Macy\u0027s life. Hadn\u0027t seemed important. Until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0027t be right. Pensive, Devyn stroked two fingers over his jaw. \"Does the name Aleaha Love mean anything to anyone?\" Though he asked the question of everyone, he kept his attention fixed on Macy. She\u0027d been pale before, but now she became chalk white, the thin lines of her veins visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone but Macy and Breean shook their head no. Those two shared a heavy look, Macy fingering the locket hanging around her neck. Interesting. If Macy wasn\u0027t Bride\u0027s friend—which, Devyn would now bet his most prized possession, aka his cock, that she was—the two were involved somehow. Was the locket something Bride had given her? Something that reminded her of Bride?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you see this vampire?\" Macy asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few blocks from Dallas\u0027s apartment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you didn\u0027t tell me that,\" Dallas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think it was significant.\" Until now. To test the foundation of his theory, he added, \"She was just another woman in a long line of women. Unimportant and a bother. There was no reason to mention her at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy tensed, as though offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, so did Mia. \"Insulting ass! Better watch your mouth before you lose your tongue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Females the world over would hunt you down and destroy you for such a travesty.\" He traced his fingertip around the rim of his glass. \"I say we find Bride and kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy gasped and shook her head violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia nodded in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn almost grinned. Oh, yes indeed. Macy was Bride\u0027s friend. No doubt about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot kill her until we find out where she\u0027s hidden the Schön,\" Kyrin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will be killing her.\" The words left Devyn with more force than he\u0027d intended. \"I was teasing, of course. I don\u0027t want her killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallas punched him in the shoulder. \"You\u0027ve got a great sense of humor. Anyone ever tell you that? No? Well, that\u0027s because I was lying, and your humor sucks ass. You don\u0027t tell a room full of killers to kill someone and expect the target to walk away unscathed. Moron.\" He drained his whisky sour and slammed his glass onto the tabletop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Respect the wood or die,\" Jaxon said. \"Mishka will have my ass if anything happens to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMishka was currently out on assignment. She was stronger, faster, deadlier, than anyone around her, and could crush a man with a single squeeze. He had to get his hands on a cyborg soon. A vampire cyborg would be even better. And as Bride was more than a vamp, it was entirely possible he\u0027d get his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Dallas muttered, properly shamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn patted his friend\u0027s hand. \"I love when our channels of communication are open like this.\" He was fighting a grin. \"I really do. Makes me feel so close to you. It\u0027s heartwarming. I think there\u0027s even a tear in my eye. But back to the vampire. She\u0027s mine. I\u0027ll take care of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyrin arched a brow at him. \"Another morsel for your collection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.\" Truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Top brass won\u0027t like it,\" Dallas muttered, but there was laughter in his tone. \"He\u0027s right,\" Mia said. \"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy wouldn\u0027t like it either, judging by the fire now blooming in her blue eyes. \"I\u0027m sure I can convince you of the wisdom of my plan, Miss Snowball.\" Even if she didn\u0027t like it, she wouldn\u0027t be able to stop it from happening. \"I\u0027ll give her to you when I\u0027m done with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike her man, she arched a brow. \"Snowball?\" Then she shook her head and waved her hand. \"Give me Nolan, and then we can talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDone, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"H—how are we going to capture her?\" Macy asked on a trembling breath. She was gripping the edge of the table, her knuckles tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelling, how Breean reached over and squeezed her hand in comfort. The otherworlder knew, as Devyn had suspected. Most likely Macy planned to learn his intentions, find her friend first, warn her, and send her into hiding. Understandable. Devyn would do the same thing, were the situation reversed. That wouldn\u0027t stop him from tricking Macy now, though. Nothing interfered with his objective. Ever. That would make him regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something she wants,\" Devyn said with relish, \"and I plan to dangle it under her nose until she finds me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pounding on the door woke her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Bride blinked open her eyes. Her vision was cloudy at first, but gradually it focused, and her apartment came into view. A single lamp burned, its golden glow providing a small circle of light. The window was still open, drifting a warm morning breeze inside and lifting her curtains. Thankfully, she was far enough away that the sunlight didn\u0027t touch, and therefore burn, her sensitive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe well-worn couch, basket of folded laundry, and so-small-you-had-to-strain-to-see-it TV were where they had always been, though she was not. She was on the floor, trembling from cold and bone-deep hunger. Naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn. The name was like an electric current inside her, and memories flooded her mind, heating her up inside and out. She\u0027d found him, had watched that beautiful body stalk the streets of New Chicago, constantly fighting the urge to reveal herself and drink from him, savoring every delicious drop of blood he possessed, and then she\u0027d stolen his captive, beating him soundly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pound of fists echoed at the entrance. \"Amy. Amy, I know you\u0027re in there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBride dragged herself to a sitting position. She swiped her tongue over her lips, her mouth as dry as dirt, her teeth aching. So hungry ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally,\" a relieved voice breathed behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whipped around, and had to massage her temples to assuage the sudden wave of dizziness. When the dizziness cleared, she studied her companion. He wore the same clothes she\u0027d left him in: a button-down and slacks. They were wrinkled, stained with sweat. A plain copper necklace wrapped around his neck like a snake, tight, almost choking, causing his pulse to flutter wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMmm, a snack ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No, no, no. \"You\u0027re alive,\" she said foolishly. And damn, her throat hurt. It was swollen and raw from disuse. Or had she screamed in pleasure as dream Devyn licked his way up and down her body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just when the hell had she begun thinking of him as a sexual conquest? He was a means to an end. That was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barely.\" Her captive lay on the cot she\u0027d provided for him, facing her, his skin grayish, his eyes sunken. There were small circular wounds on his neck, as if something had tried to bite its way free of his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom, boom, boom. \"Amy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. Had the otherworlder shouted for help while she\u0027d slept, and was the cavalry now here to rescue him? \"How long have I been out?\" If she was going to be arrested, it\u0027d be nice to know how long Devyn had had to find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. Had she been human, she probably would have peed herself. Thankfully, that was not a bodily function she\u0027d ever had to endure. She smacked her lips together, her mouth still as dry as a desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to feed. Automatically her gaze returned to the otherworlder\u0027s neck, and her still-aching fangs elongated. Blood ... good ... need ... Waaaay past time to feed. He\u0027s sick. You\u0027ll probably vomit after you drink him, anyway, weakening you all the more. Who cared? Her body always absorbed the first few sips before the sickness hit her, which was how she\u0027d managed to survive, and she would be stronger. Right now, even the taste of blood would have been enough for her. So, so good ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your eyes are glowing,\" the otherworlder said, but he didn\u0027t sound as if he cared. \"Damn it, Amy. Rent\u0027s overdue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices snapped her out of the blood haze, and she blinked. Rent. Thank God. No arrest today. Maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now your eyes are back to normal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, I know you can hear me. I want my money, or your ass is outta here. Understand?\" More banging. \"I told you one more delayed payment and you were gone. Don\u0027t tell me you don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your name\u0027s Amy?\" her captive asked. \"I thought Devyn called you Bride.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-8.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
