Although the quality was relatively low, after receiving Xiao Moxian’s primordial yin, his phoenix blood could be said to have undergone a qualitative leap. It could be said that within the entire Ancient Phoenix Clan, there wasn’t a single person who could compare with even 1% of his current bloodline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNow, after being galvanized by Xiao Moxian’s nirvanic flames, Lin Ming’s own phoenix blood began to brilliantly burn, causing a nirvana fire tribulation within his inner world!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA phoenix’s nirvana was not a light matter. The more powerful a phoenix, the truer this was. In most cases, although nirvana wouldn’t fail, it would still consume a massive amount of origin energy; this was an inevitable truth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian’s nirvana was different. Seemingly because of their yin yang harmony or perhaps because of dragon and phoenix dual cultivation, the process of their nirvana was extremely smooth. Their mortal bodies melted away, becoming forms of energy.
