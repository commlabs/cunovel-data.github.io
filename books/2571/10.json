The cop working that crowd was Charlie Sims. Charlie was one of Yuki’s “people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie was smiling, too. Charlie had two kids, and in this economy kids were expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk to me,” said Yuki Nitobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrolman Charlie Sims, the officer at the barricade cut a quick look around. Most of the crowd was around front, but the side streets were still pretty clear. The only spectators were yards away, peering at the parked police cars as if the empty machines held some answers to the big commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a mess up there,” said Sims. “I wasn’t up there for long, but it was long enough to see how bad it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me,” she urged. “Remember the Boddinger thing a couple of years ago?” She chewed her lip for a moment, accessing the vast heaps of data stored in her head. Every major crime, every disaster, every drop of blood that came onto her personal radar was filed away. She nodded. “Husband and wife killed, right? Russian mob was suspected. Is that what we have here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not the Russians, or at least I don’t think so; it’s the way it was done. Blood everywhere, and I do mean everywhere. And even though I was only a few feet inside the door, I could see through into the bedroom. The bathroom door was wide open, and it was all right there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was right there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The girl. In the bathroom and in the bedroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one?” asked Yuki, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was she in the bathroom or the bedroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both,” he said with a crooked jack o’lantern smile. “Whoever did this cut her to frigging pieces, Yuke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated being called “Yuke,” but right now she didn’t care. This was good stuff. This was really, really good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to get in there,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSims laughed. “Not a chance. The Goody-Goody Twins pulled this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuki cursed. With most of the detectives, Yuki could manage to bribe, bully or flirt her way right up to the edge of the crime scene. Close enough to get a quick photo or some footage with a lipstick cam. But not with Schmidt and Yanoff. They gave nothing to the press. Not a word, not an inch. The miserable pricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what you saw,” she said. “Everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We good with the rates?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Charlie, don’t be that way. You know I’m always good. But let me say this,” she added, “If you can get me a copy of a crime scene photo, there’s an extra hundred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’d fry me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only if they figured out who leaked the photo, and you’re too smart for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSims gave her a sly look, well aware that he was being played. But the money was sweet, and he had a friend in forensics who could get him pretty much anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A hundred for a picture,” he said. “But if there’s more, then we talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it’s good, we’ll talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about that, then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. He told her everything he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e— 9 —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e75 Bedford Street, NY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctober 4, 8:36 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine Days before the V-Event\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was junk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroken. Tangled. Smeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hours ago it had been beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours ago it had sweated and groaned and clawed and cried out a name that wasn’t his. Not really his. Not deep down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour ago it had screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was junk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched it change colors as the night changed. As clouds moved in front of the moon. As the slashed and stained curtains moved in the sluggish breeze, painting the debris with translucent shadows. There were colors he had never seen before. Nothing was black. Nothing was white. But there were ten thousand shades of blue and gray and red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, he had never suspected such colors existed. Now, he could not bear the thought of never seeing them again. Nothing could be as beautiful as this. Not in daylight. He wasn’t sure — he had never seen daylight — but he was positive that its glow would wash colors to a uniform opaque nothingness. For him, at least. The way night did to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the other him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Michael Fayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayne. The one whose perceptions were blunted. Christ, how could he have managed to walk down a street with perceptions as fractured and useless as that? How could anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not yet Michael Fayne, though. Not entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his arms around his shins. It wasn’t to protect himself from the sting of the October breeze. No, he liked that. He liked that just fine. Wrapping his arms around his legs was comfortable. It felt somehow more natural as he crouched there on top of the refrigerator. Barefoot, naked. Painted in a thousand shades of red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at the junk on the floor. And on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe counted the pieces. He frowned and counted again, coming up short again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the rest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut a glance at the window, wondering if he’d thrown some pieces out. It’s possible. For a while there he wasn’t tracking everything that he was doing. For a while he just was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was aware of everything. The colors, the smells. Some of them were smells he used to hate. That was all changed. Every smell had a thousand layers. Peel one back and there was another. And another. It frustrated him that he couldn’t identify them, but then he thought about it. He would have time to catalog each and every one. If he was right about things, he would have time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was wrong …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of losing all those smells, all those colors, all those tastes — God, the million subtleties of taste — was the only thing that frightened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly he realized that it truly was the only thing that frightened him. Everything else just didn’t. Not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot since the change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long had it been?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime meant almost nothing to him, and he realized that with barely a flicker of concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that was wrong. That was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime did matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime meant change. Time meant night and day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked out of the window at the cloudy sky. It was deep into the night now. Maybe two o’clock. Or was it three?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly fear was there, blossoming like a tumor inside his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it was four or five o’clock?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the end of night meant the end of this? The end of all these beautiful smells and tastes and sounds and textures? What if it meant the end of him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, trying to hear the pulse of the night. New York was so loud and loud in so many ways. A minute ago he loved that symphony, now it was a cacophony. On one side of a fractured moment, it spoke to him in its ten thousand voices, revealing truths to him, and on the other side it yelled so loud that he could not understand any single thing. The change was that fast, that complete; and he was aware that it was not an actual change. It was perceptual, but that made it no less terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the night hiding from him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did time mean to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he struggled to understand this sudden mystery, he realized that the color of the night was different. Someone had splashed blood on the clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at it for a long minute, eyes unblinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God,” he said in a voice that was thick and wrong. There were too many teeth in his mouth, and too much mucus in his throat. Too much bile in the blood that burned in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bloody clouds whispered an awful secret to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not five o’clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd dawn was going to tear him apart. As he had torn her apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would reach into him and rip out whatever it was that allowed him to smell ten thousand smells and see ten thousand colors. It would smash down his perceptions, cracking them, blunting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning them all to junk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning him to junk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped down from his perch, landing in the lake of blood that covered the kitchen floor. He stared down into it, seeing his naked body, seeing the belly swollen with quarts of blood. Seeing the face that was new and not at all like the face he had worn for thirty-four years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the eyes. And only in this muted reflection did black and white exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite, white teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottomless black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, even as he watched, the teeth changed. The eyes dimmed from a totality of blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he begged. Still in his voice, not in Fayne’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked wildly around the apartment. His clothes were smeared with blood. His shirt was torn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t matter. He dressed as fast as he could. If he hurried, if he was fast, maybe he could make it home before true daylight stripped the magic off the sky. Maybe he could wash away the blood, hide the clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he forget this? Would he think this was all a dream?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, God, please …” he begged, though he was not at all sure to which God he prayed. He — the imposter who would soon reclaim this body — believed in nothing. Maybe he believed in money, maybe in his dick, but nothing else. Nothing grander. There were no mysteries in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut since the change, the new him — the true him — knew that there were many mysteries. Vast mysteries. Beautiful secrets waiting to be whispered in his ear. Secrets waiting to be torn from the flesh and read in the movement of blood through capillaries and veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould the god of that world listen to prayers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” he whispered as he hurried out of the apartment. “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was what he knew that he was, if this change was what he believed it had to be, then there must be a god of this dark world. Nothing else made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the apartment door behind him and fled down the back stairs. His car was parked behind the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he was behind the wheel and did not remember opening the door or getting in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ten blocks from the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow — ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was reaching for a doorknob. His. No, his. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/v-wars/page-10.html","bookId":2571,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:04 PM"}
