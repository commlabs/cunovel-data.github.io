She looked like she’d lost weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Laur,” I said, hugging her back. She felt gaunt in my arms, but she smelled the same. Laurel always had a clean, cinnamony smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down across from her. After we ordered, pancakes and bacon for both of us, she said, “So how have you been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been all right,” I said, chugging down some juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap. How was I supposed to broach this subject?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t my style. It didn’t come naturally to me, the way it would for Jere. I was butting in on something that wasn’t my business. But I had to do it. For her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat and said, “I called you because I wanted to talk about the wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face got tight, but she didn’t interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laur, I think you should go. I think you should be part of it. You’re her mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel stirred her coffee, and then she looked at me and said, “You think they should get married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, what do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think they love each other and they’re going to do it regardless of what anyone else thinks. And … I think that Belly really needs her mom right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrily, she said, “Isabel seems to be doing just fine without me. She never even called to let me know where she was. I had to hear it from Adam—who, by the way, is apparently paying for this wedding now. Classic Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Steven’s a best man, and Belly’s dad is going to give in the way he always does. It seems I’m the only holdout.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Belly isn’t fine. She’s barely eating. And … I heard her crying last night. She was saying how Taylor’s mom is throwing her a wedding shower but it won’t feel right without her mom there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel’s face softened, just a little. “Lucinda’s throwing her a shower?” Then, stirring her coffee again, she said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jere hasn’t thought this through. He isn’t taking it seriously enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right, he’s not a serious guy. But believe me, he’s serious about her.” I took a deep breath before I said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laurel, if you don’t go, you’ll regret it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me directly. “Are we speaking honestly with each other here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t we always?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel nodded, taking a sip of coffee. “Yes, that we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo tell me. What’s your interest in all of this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this was coming. This was Laurel, after all. She didn’t mess around. “I want her to be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” she said. “Just her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeremiah, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that’s it?” She looked at me steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just looked back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pay for breakfast since I was the one who invited her out, but Laurel wouldn’t let me. “Not gonna happen,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the drive back, I played back our conversation. The knowing look on Laur’s face when she asked me what my interest in this was. What was I doing? Picking out vases with Belly, trying to play peacemaker with the parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I was their wedding planner, and I didn’t even agree with them. I needed to disengage from the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was washing my hands of the whole mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where have you been?” I asked Conrad when he came back in the door. He’d been gone all morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer me right away. In fact he was barely looking at me. And then he said, shortly, “Just running errands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a weird look, but he didn’t offer up any more information. So I just asked, “Wanna keep me company while I go to the florist in Dyerstown? I have to pick out flowers for the wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t Jere coming today? Can’t you go with him?” He sounded annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised and a little hurt. I thought we’d been getting along really well these past few weeks. “He’s not going to be here until tonight,” I said. Playfully, I added,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, you’re the one who’s the flower-arranging expert, not Jere, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad stood at the sink with his back to me. He turned on the water, filling a glass. “I don’t want to piss him off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I heard a trace of hurt in his voice. Hurt—and something else. Fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong? Did something happen this morning?” I felt worried all of a sudden. When Conrad didn’t answer me, I went up behind him and started to put my hand on his shoulder, but then he turned around and my hand fell back to my side. “Nothing happened,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go. I’ll drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pretty quiet at the florist’s. Taylor and I had decided on calla lilies, but when I looked through the book of flower arrangements, I ended up picking peonies instead. When I showed them to Conrad, he said, “Those were my mom’s favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember,” I said. I ordered five arrangements, one for each table, just like Denise Coletti told me to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about bouquets?” the florist asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can those be peonies too?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, we can do that. I’ll put together something nice for you.” To Conrad, she said, “Are you and your groomsmen doing boutonnieres?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned red. “I’m not the groom,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s the brother of the groom,” I said, handing her Mr. Fisher’s credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left pretty soon after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back home, we passed a fruit stand on the side of the road. I wanted to stop, but I didn’t say so. I guessed Conrad could tell, because he asked, “Want to go back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, that’s okay, we already passed it,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a U-turn on the one-way street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fruit stand was a couple of wooden crates of peaches and a sign that said to leave the money in the container. I put in a dollar because I didn’t have change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you going to have one?” I asked him, wiping off my peach on my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, I’m allergic to peaches.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when?” I demanded. “I’ve definitely seen you eat a peach before. Or peach pie, at least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “Since always. I’ve eaten them before, but they make the inside of my mouth itch.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-34.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
