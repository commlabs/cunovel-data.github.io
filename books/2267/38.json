But it often worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll never do anything you don’t want to do,” Adam said as she hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I know. I guess, sometimes, still…” she sighed. “Adam, am I really such a freak? That’s how people react to me, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “Elizabeth Holmes is green with envy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but I saw the looks in everyone’s eyes tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saw the look in Matt’s eyes,” Adam corrected softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand in the air. “It’s just the look…I get it from far more people than Matt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam sat back. “I think he’s falling in love with you. What do you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I say that he’s entirely repulsed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I say that he’s afraid,” Adam told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matt Stone? You know, his name fits. He’s chiseled. He’s like coming up against a rock. Hard. And unchanging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam laughed. “Even the hardest stone can be eroded. And maybe you’ve shaken him to the core, which always make a man or woman don a facade as quickly as possible. He’s a decent man. Give him a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A chance for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A change of thought. That’s difficult to come by, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy fell silent. Difficult. Impossible. If a ghost walked by in pure daylight, oozing ectoplasm, Matt would think he was seeing sunspots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By the way—he’s worried about you. He doesn’t think you should be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says you woke up terrified last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. “I just can’t get a handle on this. I’m more frustrated than terrified, Adam, really. I see this event unfolding. I’ve taken on the persona of the man coming to the house, and that of the woman inside, waiting. I know that she’s frightened, and I know that he has deadly intentions. When I have it, the dream goes a little further each time. Then…I lose it. I know that I’m seeing the past, but something in the dream bothers me every time. There’s something that I should see, but just don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That means that there is an end out there. We are getting somewhere, Darcy. You’re seeing the event. We know that there is an entity, trying to tell us something. She’s been reaching out, but she’s still terrified herself. Poor thing. It’s the depths of the fear she was feeling when she died. We have to make certain that we know who she is—you believe it’s this Arabella. So, we’re getting close, very close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy smiled. “Adam, I actually believe that this place is swarming with ghosts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably. But the rest of them seem to be happy ghosts. Just watching over the place. Arabella, or whoever she is, has the greatest power. And that’s because she’s so desperate to say something to us all. We’ll get to it. By the way, I’ve asked David Jenner to set up a few of the cameras and some tape equipment in your room. Is that all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” she said. She’s seen Matt’s face that night. He wouldn’t be coming back to visit her in the darkness of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m right here, not a stone’s throw away. Call me if you need me. Call if you think you may need me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, Adam.” She gave him a kiss on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right, Darcy? I haven’t seen you this shaken since…since the beginning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t. She was hurt. But then she’d known better than to fall for Matt Stone, to become emotionally involved. The truth of it was that she wasn’t normal, and there just weren’t many men out there willing to deal with her circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was still staring at her. He knew her too well. “Adam, I’m fine,” she said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe Matt Stone is right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it’s dangerous for you to be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the library?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam, this I know—a ghost did not follow me into the library. I was alone when I stood on those boards. What happened was a coincidence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam, I’m close. I know I’m close. There’s some little thing there that I’m not seeing, and once I know what it is, the situation will be solved. I’m certain. Good night, and please don’t worry about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Even as she left the room, he was rewinding the tape to study it once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy walked to the Lee Room. It seemed very quiet. She didn’t feel that the eyes watched her. Then she wondered if maybe the ghost was simply exhausted. Maybe the seance was as hard on their entity as it was on those living souls who had been involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me help you!” she said aloud. “You don’t need to hurt me or anyone. You have to get the courage together to let us know what happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy locked the balcony doors. There would be no one slipping through them to see her tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeary, she got ready for bed, and crawled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emptiness around her seemed absurdly loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt arrived back at Melody House, but for several long minutes, he remained in the car, staring at the house. Brick, mortar, and stone. It was a house, nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was living history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it and knew that he loved his house, no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was falling in love with Darcy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d shared some time together. She should be perfect, soft-spoken, clear-eyed, dignified beyond belief, beautiful in her every movement. Kind to others…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just plain damned weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking him and everyone else straight down to their foundations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about Mae’s words with irritation. Whether she meant to do so or not, Darcy was perpetuating ridiculous beliefs. Maybe she really believed everything she said. The power of the imagination was tremendous. He knew that. But to believe that ghosts could come back, or even that a ghost could be causing dangerous events, even come back as a killer….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d known killers; too many of them. Men who killed in the pursuit of gain. Men and women so hung up on drugs they’d stab their own mothers for a dollar. Even those killers who thought that God or dogs ordered them to kill. And then there were those who killed for the sheer pleasure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlesh, blood, real. More terrifying than anything imagined that could go bump in the night. And he had dealt with them so many damned times that to believe that brutality could exist in some fifth dimension was preposterous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the hell had he known to go to the library the other day?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore softly and exited the car. He’d taken his time getting home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to his great pleasure, his house was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe locked up and climbed the stairs to the second landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused there. Darcy’s door…the Lee Room. She wouldn’t be expecting him. He knew that. It had nothing to do with ESP or instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen the way that she had looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went into his own room and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dream came again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had dreaded that it would, but she had been anxious as well, desperate to experience what had happened, and see. See clearly, know exactly what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe entered into the mind of the man in the past. Saw what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was, the man knew—beneath the rage that had risen within him—always urgent, obsessive, beautiful. He had seen in her again everything that he had desired when she had appeared at the upper landing. He had seen the structure of her face, the shadow and light of the night, enhancing the sculpture and curves of her body, granting moonlit magic to her hair. She could create a fire with a single glance, whisper words that could drive a man to pure frenzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could touch a man….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd do so many things. Bring arousal to life in seconds, manipulate the senses, tear into the mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, yes, and she could do so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head was spinning, torn with pain. And she was running, but it appeared she did so in slow motion. He rose in much the same way, seeing the wall, the bed, the clock, ticking away the seconds, minutes, hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTicking away the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe staggered to his feet. She was running; he had to run, too. She was so gorgeous in flight. Her appearance so fragile, so innocent. She ran….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if she could escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t so fragile, and certainly not at all innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he was far stronger. He followed her out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was captured in the replay of the past, yet her own resources blindly guiding her, Darcy rose in her sleep, anxious to catch up with the specters of time gone by. She moved like a wraith in the night, sliding across the floor, opening the door—that through which the spirit images had so easily drifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to the landing, to the rail, and looked down the stairway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a sound behind her startled her back to life. She felt a fierce shove, slamming her hard against the railing where she teetered precariously for several seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to full wakefulness in a split second, realized her position, and instinctively fought to right it. She was strong enough herself, and quickly maintained her grasp and equilibrium, her mind working quickly and with outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone real, alive and well, had been on the upstairs landing. She had heard a real noise. And real hands had attempted to push her over!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRighted, she spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt’s door was moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening? Or closing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood against the rail, her heart in her throat, staring. The door seemed to close another inch, and then to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn boxers and a robe, Matt emerged, striding out on the landing, eyes touching on Darcy, then looking up and down the second level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing out here?” The question sounded like a bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard. She knew him—didn’t she? Or did she think that she knew him because she had been so tempted to sleep with him? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/haunted-harrison-investigation-1/page-38.html","bookId":2267,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:12 PM"}
