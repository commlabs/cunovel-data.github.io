Then her voice rose. “We don’t need the caretaker’s house! I’m going home. Home—back to my family. They’re not a bunch of idiot jerks!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, there!” Penny protested cheerfully. “You know, everyone is really tired, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. Matt, he’s all he-man practical and doesn’t believe in ghosts, but I’m telling you, Roger, don’t you go being hard on your new missus! Lots of folks believe that this house is more than a little haunted, I do tell you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt walked on into the Lee Room. As he suspected, there was nothing there. The French doors to the balcony were open, and the drapes were drifting in. They must have been what scared the new bride so badly. Either that, or she just wanted the place to be haunted so badly that she had made it so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Jeannie’s peignoir robe, then discarded it as being far too see-through for this situation. Her groom would not be happy with it, he was certain. Striding to the closet, he found a pair of robes with “Melody House” inscribed on the pockets—items Penny had insisted they needed to provide a real luxury touch for those few times when he decided to rent the room. He pulled one from the hanger and headed back downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy then, Penny, Jeannie and Roger had headed into the kitchen. It was vast. The integrity of the historical aspects had been maintained with the massive hearth and the many copper pots and herbs that adorned wall mounts, but the huge refrigerator, sub-zero freezer, and stainless steel stove were all necessary modern conveniences for the many social events, dinners, luncheons, and meetings that were held at the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newlyweds were seated at the table with Penny. She had apparently moved like lightning, microwaving water and hurriedly supplying brandy, because they were all sipping out of huge earthenware mugs already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been joined there by several of the other residents of the property, probably all awakened by the screaming. Matt’s cousin Clint, who, like Penny, lived in one of the apartments above the stables, was seated at the table. Clint’s eyes flashed with humor as they met Matt’s. Sam Arden, the caretaker, old, thin, and crusty, his white hair wild, was at the table as well. He shook his head and rolled his eyes when he saw Matt. Rounding out the group was Carter Sutton. He was actually an old college friend of Clint’s from the next town over. He owned a lot of local property, and had just bought a house nearby. Since it was still being held hostage by construction workers, he’d taken a room over the stables as well. It worked well. Carter made his living off his investments, and was sometimes “paper rich and cash poor,” so he was happy to look after the horses and serve as stable boy and trail guide when they rented out the horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt silently offered the robe, and walked around to take a seat at the end of the table. Penny was happily talking about ghosts. Roger was convincing his wife that there had been nothing there at all, other than the excitement of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if there was a ghost, it was probably more scared than you,” Clint assured the bride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, there are ghosts,” Sam said sagely, nodding his old head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam,” Matt protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She meant to hurt me!” Jeannie said with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think that ghosts are supposed to hurt people,” Carter said. His mustache twitched. He was as bearded as a goat, since he enjoyed a high military position in the “Rebel” unit in which he participated in many battle reenactments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She meant to hurt me,” Jeannie repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve slept in that room,” Clint said, “and honestly, nothing ever happened to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know the Lee Room like the back of my hand,” Carter teased. “It holds the fondest memories in my heart,” he told the bride with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed and laughed uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matt,” Penny said, “There’s a cup of strong tea for you right there, end of the table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said. “I’ll reheat it in a bit. I’m going to get a few things out of the caretaker’s cottage, so you two can slip on over when you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Mr. Stone, I…I don’t want to put you to any more trouble,” Roger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t sleep in this house!” Jeannie wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no trouble,” he assured them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he wanted to do right then was get out—he didn’t think he could bear to hear another of Penny’s speeches on ghosts. He allowed her, on Friday and Saturday nights, to give a “Legends of Melody House” tour, during which she liked to go on and on about various stories involving the house, and how it was rumored to be haunted by different characters, including historical figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had adamantly refused to let her call it a ghost tour. But since she did attract dozens and dozens of paying tourists, people staying as diversely far away as Williamsburg, Richmond, Harpers Ferry, and even D.C., he had to allow the endeavor. She served cider, tea, cookies, and pastries in the middle of the tour, and he knew that she was right—they paid a whole lot of bills thanks to those tours. He still didn’t like them, or anything that suggested that Melody House was really haunted. However, he tolerated it all, for the sake of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on, Matt—we’ll keep them entertained for you,” Clint told him laconically. Matt arched a brow. Clint could be openly lascivious. He had surely enjoyed the spectacle of the bride, wrapped in the antique quilt and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Matt said dryly, and left them all to their arguments on whether there was or wasn’t a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, he was moved back into his room at the main house, and he and Penny and Roger had packed up the newlyweds, who were now happily settled in the caretaker’s cottage. Penny returned to her apartment over the stables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt had barely gotten back to sleep before he heard a ringing sound. He fumbled around to turn off his alarm, but it was the phone instead. One of his officers was on the other end, anxiously urging him to get moving; they had a domestic violence situation threatening to turn explosive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt hurriedly dressed, his thoughts half on the night gone by, and half on the day to come. There it was—the truth again. As his dad had once told him, when he had shivered at the sight of an old cemetery, the dead were the safest people around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the living you had to watch out for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day was hell for Matt. He was so tired most of it, he could have toppled over. It began with the situation at the Creek-more house, old Harry threatening to kill his wife and kids, accusing her of sleeping around, claiming he didn’t even know if the kids were really his or not. Thayer had kept the situation under control until he got there. Matt had managed first to get Harry to let him in, then pretended to share most of a bottle of whiskey with him, convince him he could do DNA testing on his kids, finally get the shotgun, and haul Harry off to jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, he endured the rest of the week, staying in the main house, hearing the honeymooners in the pool at all hours, day and night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeannie came to thank him personally for not throwing them out. Her honeymoon, between the pool and the horses and the incredible Jacuzzi in the caretaker’s house, was bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had forgotten about the ghost. She admitted that she’d had a lot to drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny kept insisting that there was a ghost, and he was being a blind fool to ignore it. Either something bad was going to happen, or—on the bright side!—were they to prove that a ghost existed, they could get so rich they’d never have to worry about the upkeep of the place again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the honeymooners departed and everything went back to normal. Then, Penny started at him again. She wanted to have a seance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe begged her to leave him alone. He had too much work on his plate at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, Penny backed off and contented herself with her tours. Matt thought that life was pleasantly back to routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she came to him with the letter from Adam Harrison, Harrison Investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a month later that Clara Issy, one of the five daytime housekeepers, stopped dead in her tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a sunny morning. The beautiful old bedroom in Melody House was as it always was. The bed she had just made with its shiny four-poster and quilted cover sat against the right wall. The polished mahogany bureau held the modern touch of the entertainment center within it. The television was off. The French doors to the balcony and the wraparound porch were ajar because it was such a nice day and the breeze was fresh and clean, causing the white draperies to stir and dance. That was natural, and she was accustomed to the smell and feel of fresh air. She loved it, and she wasn’t at all fond of the air-conditioning that ran through the summer months. No, the room itself was just as it always was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood near the open French doors, jaw agape, and stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she was alone in the room, yet something else was moving. Something that drifted from the bed. Something in a hazy form, something cold, something that felt threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt approached Clara. She felt something touch her face, almost like the stroke of fingers against her cheek. Very cold fingers. Dead fingers. She thought she heard a whispering. Scratchy, against her ear. Something that pleaded…or threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were frozen in a vise around her broom handle. Her body felt as if it had jelled into ice. Fear raced up and down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold…wrapped around her. Tightly. More and more tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, her jaw snapped shut. She broke the sensation of terror. She screamed, not a bloodcurdling sound, but one that barely held a gasp of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she found life, and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut to the second floor landing; there was no one there. Down the flight of stairs to the grand foyer, where again, the house was empty. She headed toward the second doorway to the right of the sweeping stairway. Surely, for the love of God, someone would be in the house office—Penny, a tiny bastion against anyone evil, but someone, at the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara breathed a sigh of relief. Matt was there. Bursting out the doorway before she could reach it. He was in his work uniform, but he hadn’t headed out for the station yet; it was still very early. Thank God. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/haunted-harrison-investigation-1/page-5.html","bookId":2267,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:12 PM"}
