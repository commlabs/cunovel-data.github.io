They were actually dispatched all at once, and were even led by Freya herself, a Crystal Phase Warlock!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the additional power from their bloodlines, Warlocks were usually stronger than ordinary Magi. Once they advanced to the Crystal Phase, they would immediately be able to compare to peak Crystal Phase Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven all this, it was no wonder that Mia’s face looked glum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of you have been wreaking havoc near the territory of the Ouroboros Clan! How can we let all of you go so easily?” Freya wore a tight-fitting hunting suit, and looked extremely heroic. Of course, that was only if one ignored the childish face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“River Agu’s warehouse robbery, the extermination of the Rolithe Family, and Count Oakta’s disappearance. Who exactly is the mastermind behind all these?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya stared at the three Magi, and an extreme feeling of danger overwhelmed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo subdue and order three vicious Magi in the Crystal Phase was not something that could be done by any ordinary power. With the addition of the chain of events that had occurred recently, Freya had a bad premonition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just the Ouroboros Clan?” Mia’s group of three Magi all registered smiles of disdain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch out! Lest they…” After seeing that smile, Leylin’s pupils shrank, and he quickly gave a reminder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom! Boom! Boom!* Three other rays of black clashed with the Blood Serpent Organisation like lightning, overcoming the strong obstructions before arriving next to Mia’s group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three… Crystal Phase!” Freya grit her teeth, and she sounded bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did she expect that the opponents had reinforcements, which obviously meant that they had made preparations with regards to the plan of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was already at the limit of her current strength in subduing three Crystal Phase Magi. But now that there were three more? Freya felt her heart sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What now? If you don’t wish for the elites in your family to perish here, then release us now!” Mia’s voice had a tinge of complacency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not enough! He needs to stay!” The three Crystal phase Magi who’d appeared afterwards pointed at Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Why?” Leylin touched his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The damage you’ve done to us is not light, and only the Demon Hunter’s rewards can make up for it!” Hill shot Leylin a look before glancing at Freya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is not a Warlock from your family. Miss Freya, I presume you wouldn’t want to simply treat us as your enemies just for a member of your organisation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin rolled his eyes internally. It would be impossible for discord to be sowed with such simple tactics. However, due to the fact that personal interests were involved, this could bring about more trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Leylin had not planned to put his own safety in the hands of others, and had backup plans already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Demon Hunter?” Freya muttered to herself. She had heard of how Leylin and a few others had offended that particular Morning Star Magus. If those Crystal phase fugitives were under the Demon Hunter’s wings, it would be understandable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the Warlocks thought of that point, and after hearing Hill’s words they looked at Leylin in a different light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though they belonged to the same organisation, and they’d had some friendly interactions before, Leylin was simply not important enough for them to offend a Morning Star Magus without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning Star Magi in the central continent had power and status, and their dignity could not be infringed upon lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the two organisations were hostile, they hadn’t yet completely fallen out with each other. As a result, many of the Warlocks thought that it was worth it to give up Leylin to get on Cyril’s good side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few Warlocks immediately distanced themselves from Leylin. This included the very Julian who had been fighting at his side all this while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya’s face immediately registered a change. She grit her teeth as she looked at the numerous Warlocks from her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin is a Marquis of our clan, we will never hand him over!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clamour was started amongst the Warlocks. From their point of view, their family did not have to do so much for an outsider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My decision is firm! All of you, quickly get out of my territory, or else you’ll come to regret it!” Freya said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The one who’ll come to regret it will be you!” Mia said furiously, and together with the five figures behind her, turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait a minute!” Just when the Blood Serpent Organisation had made a path, an ill-timed voice sounded that caused both parties to look around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin, don’t do anything rash!” Freya’s voice betrayed her anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though they were related by bloodline, the Ouroboros Clan was divided into many factions that competed with each other. This was the most she could do for Leylin. Were he to go and provoke them without discrimination, Freya would not risk the danger of her family’s elimination to accompany him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Leylin’s back, and bit her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Youngster, you’re lucky today to be able to hide under the skirt of a woman. Next time, you won’t be so lucky!” Mia raised her giant hammer and threatened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three Crystal Phase Magi for the ambush, and another three as backup… this should be the limits of your strength!” A blue light shone in Leylin’s eyes as he sighed, “Don’t use the Hunter as a facade, he’s not fit for that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmmm? What did you just say?” Fury appeared on the faces of some of the Crystal Phase Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I’m saying is that you have to stay here today. There’s no escaping from that, even if you’re using the name of a Morning Star Magus!” Leylin’s tone was light, but seemed to emphasise his words. At the same time, a mountainous might instantly erupted from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crystal… Crystal Phase! How long have you been...” Freya covered her mouth in extreme shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks would typically depend on the accumulation of time to make a breakthrough via their bloodlines. Freya’s own breakthrough to the Crystal Phase at her age had deemed her a genius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Leylin? He was only 200 years old, and yet had already broken through the bottleneck to the Crystal Phase!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya immediately thought of the changed situation on the battlefield after Leylin revealed his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other party had a total of six Crystal Phase Magi, and Freya’s side had two with the addition of Leylin Julian and the other members of her organisation could at most resist the attacks of three Crystal Phase Magi. Overall their strength was still lower than that of their opponents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, in that case, for the other party to want to cause great damage to Freya’s team, their chances at succeeding would be greatly minimised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the small disparity in strength and the apprehensions about damages on both sides, ordinary threats would have no effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll deal with these three Crystal Phase Magi! You can settle the remaining ones right?” Leylin had undone the pretense of the transfiguration spell, and had released his entire strength without any qualms as he pointed to Mia’s initial group of three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem!” With Freya’s Crystal Phase strength and the addition of Julian and the Blood Serpent Warlock Organisation’s support, to annihilate the three Magi would not be a problem. It would only be a matter of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, are you sure you’re up to it?” Freya glanced at Leylin, and in her eyes was worry that she could not conceal. After all, the enemies were Crystal phase Magi as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha… Don’t worry…” Leylin laughed, and numerous black flames shot out like arrows as they trapped Mia, Hill, and Fein within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually wanted to, in one move, deal with three Magi that were similar in strength to him together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll grant your death wish! Just nice, my Bloodthirsty Hammer lacks the spiritual wailing of a Crystal Phase Magus!” Mia smiled coldly as she rushed forward with the metal hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bam!* The heavy hammer rippled with terrifying amounts of energy, creating a huge crater on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lass who only uses brute force! I happen to detest beings like these lately!” Leylin’s silhouette grew translucent, giving off a glow which swiftly appeared before Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot stand you, but it’s a piece of cake to subdue you!” Leylin’s eyes registered coldlness, a black ray slowly appeared from his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fatality’s Tip!” The black ray of death tunneled through the hammer and the innate defensive spells, shooting at Mia’s forehead like black lightning. When it exited, it brought with it a large amount of blood as well as brain matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* It was not until Mia’s corpse fell to the ground that Hill and Fein reacted to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had they seen? The famed Mia who was known for her hammer, someone at the peak of the Crystal Phase, died at the hands of her opponent. The two had not even dueled for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Could it be that he has already advanced to the Morning Star realm?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, an idea that shocked the two appeared within their thoughts, which instantly caused their limbs to become colder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin himself had not expected the effects of the sudden attack to be so successful as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had originally already reached the state of a rank 3 Hydro Phase Magus, and with his bloodline strength matured to an extent, he had managed to prematurely reach his limits now together with the help of the Lamia fingerbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, he not only had a terrifying spiritual force, his other credentials had far surpassed that of ordinary Crystal Phase Magi by a huge margin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis terrifying strength had the support of the powerful spell tailored for him by the A.I Chip— Fatality’s Tip!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the factors had come together, and perhaps with the help of Mia’s complacency, he had managed to achieve such success. Even Leylin himself was grateful for this stroke of luck that arrived just in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems that in my current state, few can match up to me unless they\u0027re at or above the Morning Star realm!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at the venue which had instantly quieted down, and let out a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you looking at?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya was distracted for only a short while before she instantly ordered the gathering of the Blood Serpent Warlocks. Leylin’s terrifying outburst had allowed her to see hope for subduing and annihilating the opponents here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of her earlier humiliation seemed to have triggered the adventurer in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-474\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-476\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-475","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
