No\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone is indispensable, not even Tom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus Christ on a crutch, I hope you’re listening to yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExasperated, he turned, propping his butt against the kitchen counter. “Tom is actually the one person in this camp who is. Think about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuke and Cindi, what they’re willing to do for him. I guarantee not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone kid would take a bullet for you or me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tom is only useful so long as he remains an asset, Weller, not a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eliability. The last thing we need is for him to decide that this girl is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealive and it’s his mission to track her down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeller had to work to keep the chagrin from making its way to his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface. This was precisely what Tom thought and wanted: There was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eski pole, Weller. There’s the Glock. Tell me how I can ignore that. If those\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckies got her out, if there’s even a chance she’s alive . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you focus on the fact that he’s out of that damn tower,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he came back.” Although that, Weller thought, was more a matter of luck than anything else. If that Chucky hadn’t shown her face,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe wasn’t sure Tom would’ve returned. He could picture the boy taking off, looking for some sign of where those Chuckies had taken\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex—which, he thought, wasn’t necessarily as crazy as it sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Tom said about that entire fiasco on the ridge the night they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblew the mine and the way those Chuckies just kept coming . . . made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea lot of sense, damn it. “Right now, he wants to talk, so I’ll listen.” “Yeah, and I bet you’re just so very understanding.” Her eyes suddenly slitted. “Did you promise to help him look for her?” It was a little disconcerting that she’d jumped to that conclusion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso easily. “Not exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, for God—” She huffed. “What did you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That when we’re done with Rule, if there’s some sign, a direction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . I’ll help him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellie’s mouth unhinged. “She’s dead, Weller. He’s basing this on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea ski pole and a gun that’s not even hers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Mellie, he’s not so far gone he doesn’t see it’s nuts, a long\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshot at best. But you weren’t up on that rise. You’re not carrying what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe is. The last thing he needs is us rubbing his nose in it, or you interfering, lecturing . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will do whatever I think—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut the hell up,” he rapped. “Mellie, I need you to listen good\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand hard. Tom is a soldier. He’s smart, he’s strong. He’s braver and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore loyal than almost anyone I’ve ever known—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And insane to go up there alone—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he still has a heart to break,” Weller grated. “For God’s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esake, Mellie, think for a damned second. Tom’s not eating; he’s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebarely slept. He’s grieving. Now, there’s that Glock, and he’s grabbed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehold of this little bubble of hope, but it’s a fragile thing, and so is his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoul, and I am not going to be the one to crush either. I know he has\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto let go eventually. He does, too, I think. But people let go in their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown way at their own time. He’s not ready yet, but he will be. This\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efight was a good thing, all in all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you figure that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing like a little near-death to make you reevaluate the merits\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof living,” Weller said, but didn’t smile. “That boy nearly got his head\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehanded to him today, and that scared the hell out of him. Now, he’s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etalking and that’s good. But it can go either way. Push him too hard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he’ll bottle himself right back up. That’s what Tom does: handles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings on his own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like going to the lake by himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, yeah.” She was tiring him out. “Can we get past this already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd give the kid some credit: other boys’d crawl into their bags and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever come out after a fight like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My God.” Her eyes sharpened. “You admire him. What is he, the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboy you always wanted to be but weren’t? Or is it more? Don’t tell me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou care about him. For heaven’s sake . . . he’s a tool, Weller.” “Anyone can tell you, you got to take good care of your tools, you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant them to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t give me any of your folksy cowboy bullshit.” She let go of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea humorless grunt. “So when the sudden conversion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the rise. When I heard her call and him answer and near about kill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehimself to get to her. Then I realized just what I’d done and that nothing, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven revenge, is worth this. If ever anyone needed to let go of the past\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . But he doubted it would be wise to share any of this with Mellie,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho had her own allegiances and none of them to him. Showing her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis back, Weller tore open a second packet of instant. The aroma of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrong coffee hit him the way it always did, something so fine and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood it hurt to think there would come a time when this simple pleasure would also vanish. No one would be importing coffee beans or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emanufacturing instant for years, maybe decades. “I’m only saying I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand where he’s coming from. I also think it’s in our best interest to get at what’s bothering him about that Chucky. I’m just not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esold that he’s told us everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” He practically heard her eyebrows arch. “What do you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink he’s leaving out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it’s conscious,” he said, tipping the pack of instant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso the granules came in a slow stream. “Just a hunch. I think he knows\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething but can’t put his finger on it. Understand what I’m saying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike seeing someone in a crowd you could swear you’ve met but you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan’t remember their name or even how you know them. Anyway, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efigure, sit with him awhile, don’t push, let him calm down . . . whatever’s bothering him will find its way out.” With a little help, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mellie didn’t need to know that. “Best thing for him now is some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erest; then get him back out there with the kids. They’ll anchor him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetter than anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.” Pause. “I wonder how well you and Tom will get along\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonce we get to Rule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart skipped a beat. Easy. Don’t let her goad you. He tried relaxing the angry jut of his jaw. “Yeah, what’s the word on that any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway? How much longer we going to sit here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a problem with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stirred, watching as the liquid quickened and grew dark. “Just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003easking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause. “We’re supposed to wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned a look. “For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe favored him with a wintery smile. “Well, let me see. You’re a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle banged up, Tom is a mess, and only a few of these children can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eactually fight. I agree that with Tom back, it’s best to put his time to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood use. Instead of running all over creation looking for a girl who’s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edead, a few bombs, some flamethrowers—they’d be nice.” “But that’s not why we’re waiting,” he said. “He has plenty of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efirepower to spare. That’s where we got the C4 in the first place. So\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat’s the holdup?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you care? Frankly, I’d think you’d be relieved. Every\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecond we delay is one more when Tom never knows just how much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou’ve lied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite himself, he felt a jab of fear. “I don’t recall you being all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat honest yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True, but you and Tom being blood brothers all of a sudden . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. have you ever considered that it might be better all around if Tom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever makes it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a sharp look. “Don’t you even think it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone has to.” She spread her hands, which were blunt and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweathered, like the rest of her. “Once Tom discovers the truth, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewouldn’t be surprised if he can’t decide between throwing you to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckies or killing you very, very slowly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you let me worry about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. That’s your call . . . until it’s not. As for when we go”—she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunched a shoulder, then let it fall—“I do what I’m told. He wants us\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait for what? That was the question. To be honest, the idea of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing back to Rule wasn’t all that appealing, because Mellie was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeller had told a lot of lies to a lot of people. He’d thought that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebringing down Peter, who really was to blame, then destroying the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emine and killing all of Rule’s precious little Chuckies would ease the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eold grief that just wouldn’t let go. Or make the face of sweet dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandy finally fade. Yet he had done much worse, not only lying but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturning in Kincaid, a friend, so that little pissant Aidan could do his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edevil’s work as Kincaid screamed and screamed, sacrificing himself to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuy Chris time to get clear. And for what? If the cold hadn’t taken\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris, the Chuckies would’ve. Nathan, too, and the girl, Lena. And now here’s Tom, self-destructing in front of my eyes, and this is on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So.” He looked away from his thoughts to find her steady gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egaze. “Can you control him?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah,” he said, not at all sure, and not liking that one bit \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monsters-ashes-trilogy-3/page-26.html","bookId":2566,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:03 PM"}
