deal with how I was feeling about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinishing my coffee, I rinsed out my mug, then grabbed my purse and bag on the way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tree-lined street was quiet, but the rest of New York was wide awake, its ceaseless energy thrumming with a tangible force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen in chic office wear and men in suits tried to hail taxis that streaked by, before settling for packed buses or the subway instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlower stands exploded with brilliant color, the sight of them always capable of cheering me up in the morning, as did the sight and smell of the neighborhood bakery, which was doing a brisk business at that hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a little ways down Broadway before my phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little thrill that shot through me at the sight of Gideon\u0027s name quickened my steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,
