A youth walked up to the teacher, picking up Zhou Weiqing’s paper. That youth was none other than the one he had met two days ago, the black clad youth who had been with Difuya, Ming Yu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still clad in black, his face passive as he looked at Zhou Weiqing, as if he did not recognize him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing thought to himself: \u003ci\u003eIs that fellow a teacher in this Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy? If that is so, perhaps I’m in trouble for today’s examination. \u003c/i\u003eFurthermore, he had noticed the look of respect that had flashed onto the teacher’s face when Ming Yu had taken the paper from him, even standing up and giving up his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, Shangguan Bing’er had completed her answer as well, coming to Zhou Weiqing’s side. Earlier, the teacher had been rather loud and thus she had heard the commotion, and was now looking worriedly at Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMing Yu sat there reading through the paper attentively, and when he finally raised his head to look at Zhou Weiqing once again, the expression on his face revealed much surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good… good… very good.” Ming Yu nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, saying: “This answer is the best I have seen all day. Although it is still a little naive and not detailed, but as an examinee who is registering to attend the school, it is already perfect. Teacher Ao Le, I recommend that this freshman should be given the full marks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Full marks?” The teacher’s face immediately turned red. “Sir Ming Yu, that shouldn’t be right. This student’s answer is just too absurd. He actually wanted to kill the civilians! Furthermore, at the end there’s even more bullshit. To attack the enemy camp alone, what a foolish idea. How can this answer even pass the exam, let alone get full marks?” Looking at Ming Yu, he had an incredulous look on his face. If the person in front of him wasn’t Ming Yu, he would have accused him of favouritism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMing Yu said passively: “Teacher Ao Le, you have always been researching all forms of military knowledge, but you have after all never been on an actual battlefield. War is after all forged by blood and life. This freshman’s answer is indeed the best answer. In order not to influence the other examinees, I will not explain any further. After the examination has ended, I will personally give you an explanation. However, regarding this answer, I stand by my words, to give him full marks. As for your query about launching a sneak attack on the enemy alone being naive and foolish, what if that person is a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master? Would you still think of that as naive and foolish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he actually took up the red pen beside the teacher, and wrote a big red 100 on the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, who are you? You aren’t even an examiner, how can you even correct my paper.” Zhou Weiqing did not feel grateful; towards this man who had been with his fiancee, he did not feel any favourable impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the obvious enmity in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, the teacher Ao Le finally determined that Ming Yu did not have connection to this little fellow. After all, he had never seen anyone dare rebut Ming Yu like that in public, not even the Academy Master of the Fei Li Military Academy had ever done so. He couldn’t help but say: “You have registered to study at the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy, and yet you do not know him, the Fei Li God General, Sir Ming Yu?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing turned towards Shangguan Bing’er and said: “Fei Li God General? Is he famous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er looked absolutely dumbstruck, staring at Ming Yu sitting there, her eyes filled with respect and worship. As for the other examinees also stood up with shock and joy in their eyes as soon as they heard that, some even squealing out loud. Only under several reprimands from the examiners did they sit back down to continue their examination, though their gazes often floated back to the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMing Yu looked at Zhou Weiqing, not hiding the approval in his eyes. “Little rascal, your answer has made me look at you in a different light! If not for that battle report only being known to a few of the top military commanders, I would have suspected you actually knew the truth about that battle. You do not need to suspect my motives - what happened two days ago is one matter, today is another matter. As for my qualification to correct your paper, I think I do have that, as I am the overall supervisor of this year’s registration. At the same time, I was the one who came up with this question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he turned to Shangguan Bing’er who was standing beside Zhou Weiqing, a look of surprise at her beauty. “This young lady, can I have a look at your paper?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er subconsciously passed her paper and her admission identification card to Ming Yu, who took up her paper and started reading it leisurely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did Shangguan Bing’er awaken, moving to Zhou Weiqing’s ear and saying in a low voice: “Little Fatty, this Ming Yu God General is extremely famous in the Fei Li Empire, and is one of the top members of the aggressive faction in their army. He is also one of the youngest and most famous generals of his generation, and idolised by many of the young Fei Li Empire citizens. He is considered a legend in the military world, and his battles have been considered almost myths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing curled his lip, saying: “That legendary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er continued: “He should be around 30 years old this year, but do not be misled by his age - he is extremely formidable. It is rumoured that he has been following his father, the famous general, Ming Hong since the age of six, learning all sorts of military knowledge and how to command troops. At the age of ten, his Heavenly Jewel Awakened, and at the age of twelve, he joined his father in a military exercise war game, he surprised and awed the entire military upper echelons. When he was fourteen years old, he was given the chance to enter the army early, and he worked his way up from a common soldier. In just two years, he had worked his way to Battalion Commander on his own merits, and at the age of sixteen, in a war with the Wan Shou Empire, he led his lone Battalion against 6 enemy Battalions in a classic guerrilla battle, delaying them for more than 8 hours and buying time for the rest of the Fei Li Empire armies to reach and finally winning them the battle by a huge margin. That was the battle that first propelled him to fame. After that, he returned to the Empire, and studied at this Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy for two years, earning all the accolades possible in this academy. At the age of eighteen, he returned to the battlefield, being in more than a hundred battles both big and small, and has never suffered a loss since. By the time he was twenty eight, he had amassed enough military exploits to be promoted to Regimental Commander. With a hundred thousand troops under his command, he is one of the top generals stationed at their northern border. Everytime he fights a battle, he never leaves his enemies alive, and he is also known as the God of Slaughter. The Wan Shou Empire hates his guts, and they have sent assassins after him, and also organised large scale battles just in order to trap and kill him. Despite that, he is still alive and well. Countless of Fei Li Empire citizens, and even citizens of other countries, idolize him. Such an experience, shouldn’t it be counted as legendary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s eyes whirled in their sockets as he held Shangguan Bing’er overbearingly, whispering into her ear: “I just want to know, is he your idol?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er looked at him exasperatedly, rolling her eyes as she said softly: “I only admire his military genius, but he isn’t my idol. He is fickle and indiscreet, rumoured to be very lustful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is being lustful considered fickle and indiscreet?!” Two indignant voices sounded out almost at the same time. One of which was naturally the one who was being evaluated, Ming Yu; while the other was Zhou Weiqing. After they both said it, their eyes met, with Ming Yu smiling as he shook his head, while Zhou Weiqing giving a cold humph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMing Yu held Shangguan Bing’er’s paper and smiled, saying: “Beautiful lady, do not worry, even though you said I am fickle and indiscreet, I will still be fair in my grading.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your answer was too straightforward and rather textbook, I’m sure that out of a hundred applicants, 90 of them will have a similar answer. As such, I can only give you 50 marks. To be honest, in terms of military command, inborn talent is of the utmost importance, and makes all the difference. Although I do not like to admit it, this little fellow beside you has an impressive talent, obviously higher than yours unfortunately. I have a simple evaluation for him - resolute and willing to kill. If he is truly 16 years old as he wrote on his registration, then in terms of talent he is ahead of even me. At least, at that age, I would not have thought of burning \u0026nbsp;down my own city to stop the enemy’s advance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing Ming Yu’s evaluation of them both, Shangguan Bing’er flushed a little and bowed respectfully: “Thank you, General.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMing Yu stood up, his gaze returning to Zhou Weiqing, and he smiled faintly before saying: “I’ve discovered that you are very similar to me, and I am getting more and more interested. I’ll be back to look for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a cheh sound, and spat out: “I, Your Father, am not interested in you. I’m only interested in women.” After saying that, he grabbed his paper and identification card and ran off with Shangguan Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of embarrassment flashed across Ming Yu’s face, and he shook his head helplessly. “That little rascal seemed honest, but he is indeed a rash and rebellious youth. Looks like it’s gonna be an interesting few years in the academy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, a soldier rushed to Ming Yu, saluting and saying: “Reporting, Sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, speak.” Ming Yu said calmly. Although he was only 32 years old, he had a dignified aura that definitely displayed the stateliness of a general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Orders from the headquarters for the general to head back and report to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“En… I understand.” Ming Yu waved his hands and nodded to the teachers as he strode off, leaving behind many envious, respectful and even jealous looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was pulled by Zhou Weiqing to the other end of the main square. She couldn\u0027t help but say worriedly: “Little Fatty, do not think too much. After all, General Ming Yu is already over 30, and you are only 16 years old. I believe that my Little Fatty will overtake him in the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked at her in surprise, saying: “Think too much? I didn’t think of anything ah?! I have nothing to do with that cocky fellow, why should I overtake him? He is himself, and I am my own person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was speechless, thinking to herself: \u003ci\u003eLooks like I was worried for nothing.\u003c/i\u003e “Your military examination is already with the full marks, and you don’t have to take any other exams. Just wait for me, I’ll go for the personal combat strength examination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a cold humph and said: “Who wants that fellow’s full marks. I’ll take the test with you. Your husband’s personal strength is still powerful!” As he said that, he gave a muscle flexing pose, causing Shangguan Bing’er to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-40-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-40-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-40-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
