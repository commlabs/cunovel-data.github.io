The oceans fled, and the mountains were swallowed up, and the nations were scattered to the eight corners of the World. The moon was as blood, and the sun was as ashes. The seas boiled, and the living envied the dead. All was shattered, and all but memory lost, and one memory above all others, of him who brought the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. And him they named Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—from Aleth nin Taerin alt a Camora, The Breaking of the World. Author unknown, the Fourth Age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROLOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Grace and Banners Fallen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd pressed the coin between his thumb and forefinger. It was thoroughly unnerving to feel the metal squish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed his thumb. The hard copper now clearly bore its print, reflecting the uncertain torchlight. He felt chilled, as if he’d spent an entire night in a cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stomach growled. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe north wind picked up, making torches sputter. Bayrd sat with his back to a large rock near the center of the war camp. Hungry men muttered as they warmed their hands around firepits; the rations had spoiled long ago. Other soldiers nearby began laying all of their metal—swords, armor clasps, mail—on the ground, like linen to be dried. Perhaps they hoped that when the sun rose, it would change the material back to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd rolled the once-coin into a ball between his fingers. Light preserve us, he thought. Light . . . He dropped the ball to the grass, then reached over and picked up the stones he’d been working with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what happened here, Karam\", Lord Jarid snapped. Jarid and his advisors stood nearby in front of a table draped with maps. \"I want to know how they drew so close, and I want that bloody Darkfriend Aes Sedai queen’s head!\" Jarid pounded his fist down on the table. Once, his eyes hadn’t displayed such a crazed fervor. The pressure of it all—the lost rations, the strange things in the nights—was changing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Jarid, the command tent lay in a heap. Jarid’s hair—grown long during their exile—blew free, face bathed in ragged torchlight. Bits of dead grass still clung to his coat from when he’d crawled out of the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaffled servants picked at the iron tent spikes, which—like all metal in the camp—had become soft to the touch. The tent’s mounting rings had stretched and snapped like warm wax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night smelled wrong. Of staleness, of rooms that hadn’t been entered in years. The air of a forest clearing should not smell like ancient dust. Bayrd’s stomach growled again. Light, but he would’ve liked to have something to eat. He set his attention on his work, slapping one of his stones down against the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the stones as his old pappil had taught him as a boy. The feeling of stone striking stone helped push away the hunger and coldness. At least something was still solid in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Jarid glanced at him, scowling. Bayrd was one of ten men Jarid had insisted guard him this night. \"I will have Elayne’s head, Karam\", Jarid said, turning back to his captains. \"This unnatural night is the work of her witches\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her head?\" Eri’s skeptical voice came from the side. \"And how, precisely, is someone going to bring you her head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Jarid turned, as did the others around the torchlit table. Eri stared at the sky; on his shoulder, he wore the mark of the golden boar charging before a red spear. It was the mark of Lord Jarid’s personal guard, but Eri’s voice bore little respect. \"What’s he going to use to cut that head free, Jarid? His teeth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp stilled at the horribly insubordinate line. Bayrd stopped his stones, hesitating. Yes, there had been talk about how unhinged Lord Jarid had become. But this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarid sputtered, face growing red with rage. \"You dare use such a tone with me? One of my own guards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEri continued inspecting the cloud-filled sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re docked two months’ pay\", Jarid snapped, but his voice trembled. \"Stripped of rank and put on latrine duty until further notice. If you speak back to me again, I’ll cut out your tongue\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd shivered in the cold wind. Eri was the best they had in what was left of their rebel army. The other guards shuffled, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEri looked toward the lord and smiled. He didn’t say a word, but somehow, he didn’t have to. Cut out his tongue? Every scrap of metal in the camp had gone soft as lard. Jarid’s own knife lay on the table, twisted and warped—it had stretched thin as he pulled it from his sheath. Jarid’s coat flapped, open; it had had silver buttons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jarid . . \". Karam said. A young lord of a minor house loyal to Sarand, he had a lean face and large lips. \"Do you really think . . . really think this was the work of Aes Sedai? All of the metal in the camp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course\", Jarid barked. \"What else would it be? Don’t tell me you believe those campfire tales. The Last Battle? Phaw\". He looked back at the table. Unrolled there, with pebbles weighting the corners, was a map of Andor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd turned back to his stones. Snap, snap, snap. Slate and granite. It had taken work to find suitable sections of each, but Pappil had taught Bayrd to recognize all kinds of stone. The old man had felt betrayed when Bayrd’s father had gone off and become a butcher in the city, instead of keeping to the family trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft, smooth slate. Bumpy, ridged granite. Yes, some things in the world were still solid. Some few things. These days, you couldn’t rely on much. Once immovable lords were now soft as . . . well, soft as metal. The sky churned with blackness, and brave men—men Bayrd had long looked up to—trembled and whimpered in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m worried, Jarid\", Davies said. An older man, Lord Davies was as close as anyone was to being Jarid’s confidant. \"We haven’t seen anyone in days. Not farmer, not queen’s soldier. Something is happening. Something wrong\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She cleared the people out\", Jarid snarled. \"She’s preparing to pounce\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she’s ignoring us, Jarid\", Karam said, looking at the sky. Clouds still churned there. It seemed like months since Bayrd had seen a clear sky. \"Why would she bother? Our men are starving. The food continues to spoil. The signs—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She’s trying to squeeze us\", Jarid said, eyes wide with fervor. \"This is the work of the Aes Sedai\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStillness came suddenly to the camp. Silence, save for Bayrd’s stones. He’d never felt right as a butcher, but he’d found a home in his lord’s guard. Cutting up cows or cutting up men, the two were strikingly similar. It bothered him how easily he’d shift \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-1.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
