If you hurry, you can get there while the previews are still showing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t think so. I’ll just catch up to him some other time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s up to you, but he went to the movies alone, and I’m sure he would appreciate the company of a beautiful woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed, wondering why this girl would be telling me all this. “Thanks for the tip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re more than welcome, Zoe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung around to face her. “How do you know my name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quinton and I are real close friends, and let’s just say, he’s mentioned you.” She started giggling. “Onnumerousoccasions, I might add. He was hoping you would come back around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so flattered, and I’m sure it showed all over my face. “Is that right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and I must say, he described your ass to a tee. You are very beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks!” The elevator finally arrived and I pulled the gate up to get on. “Goodnight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodnight, Zoe. By the way, I’m Diamond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got on the elevator and pulled the gate back down. “Nice to meet you, Diamond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the button for the garage, and the elevator started going down. “And Zoe, if you ever decide to take a walk on the wild side with another woman, I’d just love to turn your fine ass out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe she said that shit to me. All sorts of things started going through my mind. Was Quinton fucking her, or were they just friends? Did he tell her he ate my pussy? Was I about to bite off more than I could chew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have the answers to the questions, but nevertheless, less than five minutes later I found myself parkingoutside the movie theater. On the way in, I decided I would pretend to just accidentally bump into him, but I knew that wouldn’t work, since Quinton and Diamond obviously told each other everything. So I bought my ticket, went into the dark theater and didn’t even try to hide the fact I was there looking for him. I went from aisle to aisle whispering his name until I heard him call out, “Zoe, over here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting on the far end of an aisle, right beside the wall, and I joined him. The theater was not crowded at all, maybe thirty people tops, and everyone was spread out. “So, what brings you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good question.” I couldn’t say the real answer. I couldn’t say I had come for some dick. “Diamond told me where to find you, so I decided to join you. Is that a problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, hell no. I’m glad to see you. You had me worried I might not ever see you again.” He reached over and grabbed a hold of my hand, pulled it up to his lips, and kissed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next hour or so, we sat there in silencewatching-He Got Game. We held hands, and I was shaking like a leaf. Quinton told me he was going to grab some nachos and a drink from the concession stand and asked me if I wanted anything. I told him I would take a soda, and he said, “Okay, be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was desperately horny, and as soon as he disappeared up the aisle, I started rubbing my nipples through my blouse. I knew there was something wrong with me, even back then. Thinking about sex twenty-four/seven and playing with myself day and night had to be a sign— a sign I was not willing to recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinton came back with the nachos and drinks. I quickly returned my hands to my lap, pretending to beMs. Innocent. But when he sat back down next to me, something snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached over and started caressing his dick through his jeans, and he was clearly pleased. “Now, that’s what I’m talking about, Zoe. You want me to pull it out for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly replied, “Yes, pull it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unzipped his jeans and whipped out his dick, already hard. “Now, what are you going to do with Timex now that he’s come out to play?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ummmm, Timex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking.” We both started laughing, and I almost choked on the soda I had just sucked up through a straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, let’s see. What shall I do with him?” I was a nervous wreck, but not about to back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat my drink down on the floor, took the cup of warm cheese sauce that came with the nachos, and poured half of it all over his dick. He flinched. “Oops, my bad, let me get that for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned over the seat and started to lick the cheese off his dick. Then I got up and moved in between his legs, kneeling down on the floor so I could get more access. I started\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esucking his dick like a pro. One would have thought I had years of experience, even though it was my first time. All that reading really paid off; Quinton was moaning like crazy and holding on to the armrests of his seat for dear life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked the head first, and was hooked on the taste of a man’s juices from the second some of his precum hit the back of my throat. The shit was on from that point. I deep-throated that bitch and loved it. I almost gagged a few times, but I caught a rhythm and sucked the shaft and caressed his balls until he came in my mouth. He started trembling and acting like he was having a seizure.I was hesitant to let his dick out of my mouth, even when it got soft. I wanted some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there for a few minutes, gently licking and sucking his balls, before I got up and announced, “I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell do you mean, you have to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to get home. Enjoy the rest of your movie.” I was gathering my coat and purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started getting loud with me in the theater. “You’re crazy! Always running away! You’re just going to come in here, suck my dick, and leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shhhh! Keep your voice down. Yes, that’s exactly what I’m about to do. Leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forget this movie. Let’s go back to my place. I want to be with you.” He started feeling all over my thighs, trying to get his hand between my legs, but I wouldn’t let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quinton, I have to go. It’s been real, and thanks for the, ummmm, whatever you want to call it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there shaking his head as I made my way to the center aisle. I turned back toward him. “Besides, I owed you that from the last time. One good lick deserves another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got in my car and started the ignition, Quinton startled me by preventing me from shutting the driver’s side with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zoe, you can’t leave me like that,” he said seductively, making me weak in the knees even though I was sitting down. “Let’s go back to my place and talk. Just talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t, Quinton. I really do need to get home. It’s getting late.” I was determined to hold my ground until he started running his fingers through my hair and I lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come take a ride with me,” he suggested. “I want to show you something special.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something like what?” I inquired, full of curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something I’m positive you will like.” He could tell I was about to give in and leaned over to cut off my engine and remove my keys. He pulled me up out of the car. “There’s one little condition though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which is?” I asked with a raised eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me blindfold you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow common sense should have told me to take my ass home, but I didn’t. I followed him to his car, got in, and sat there patiently while he looked in the back for something to cover my eyes with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can Ipleasetake this blindfold off now?” Quinton had stopped his car and walked around to open up the passenger door for me. I could feel the cool night air rush inside, in direct contrast to the heat that had warmed up the interior of the car during the ride over.“Not yet,” Quinton replied. “Give me your hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached my hand out. He pulled me up and out of the car. The first thing I realized was that we were standing on some sort of gravel. Now I knew what the noise had been when I heard something hitting up against his tires a few seconds before the car came to a halt. “Where are we, Quinton?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Practice some patience, my dear.” He led me by the hand and pushed my hips backward so I was sitting on the hood of the car, the engine still warm underneath my bottom. “I want to make sure your first look is a perfect one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My first look at what?” I was getting nervous. Why, I have no idea. I had just got finished waxing his dick in amovie theater, after all. That’s the one thing I was sure he wasn’t planning to show me. I already had an eagle’s-eye view of that bad boy. “Come on, take the blindfold off, please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one more second.” I heard him walking around, and then the driver’s-side door opened. A minute later I heard “Got to Give It Up” by Marvin Gaye blaring from the car stereo. Before I knew it, Quinton kissed me gently on the nape of my neck and climbed on the hood beside me. “I used to listen to this song all the time when I was a kid, eleven years old to be exact. I would bring a little tape player out here and play it over and over again while I worked.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/addicted/page-24.html","bookId":1847,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:39:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:39:27 PM"}
