The police are going to issue a warrant for your arrest. Deal with it at once. Members of this firm do not get arrested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans sighed, and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah said, \"Trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But it doesn\u0027t look like I will be getting any sleep for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called the detective, Ron Perry, and was told that Perry was gone for the day, and would be in court in the morning. His cell phone would be off. Evans left a number for him to call back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Drake, but he was gone for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Lowenstein, but he was not in the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Margo, but she did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Jennifer Haynes and said that he would be there tomorrow, at ten o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dress professionally,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to be on television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 59\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCULVER CITY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, OCTOBER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:51 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two white camera trucks parked outside the offices of the Vanutu litigation team. Evans went inside and found workmen setting up lights and changing fluorescent light bulbs in the ceiling. Four different video crews were walking around, inspecting different angles. But nobody was shooting yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offices themselves, he noticed, had been considerably transformed. The graphs and charts on the walls were now much more complicated and technical looking. There were huge, blowup photographs of the Pacific nation of Vanutu, as seen from the air and from the ground. Several featured the erosion of the beaches, and houses leaning at an angle, ready to slide into the water. There was a school picture from the Vanutu school, beautiful brown-skinned kids with smiling faces. In the center of the room, there was a three-dimensional model of the main island, specially lit for cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was wearing a skirt and blouse and heels. She looked startlingly beautiful in a dark, mysterious way. Evans noticed that everyone was better dressed than at his first visit; all the researchers were now in jackets and ties. The jeans and T-shirts were gone. And there seemed to be a lot more researchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Evans said, \"what is this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-roll,\" Jennifer said. \"We\u0027re shooting B-roll for the stations to use as background and cutaways. And of course we\u0027re making a video press kit as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you haven\u0027t announced the lawsuit yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That happens this afternoon, here outside the warehouse. Press conference at one P.M. You\u0027ll be there, of course?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I didn\u0027t\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know John Balder wants you there. Representing George Morton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans felt uneasy. This could create a political problem for him at the firm. \"There are several attorneys more senior than I who handled George\u0027s\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drake specifically asked for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something about your involvement in getting the papers signed to finance this suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was it, Evans thought. They were putting him on television so he would not be able later to say anything about the gift of ten million dollars to NERF. No doubt they would stick him in the background for the announcement ceremony, maybe make a brief acknowledgment of his presence. Then Drake would say that the ten million was coming, and unless Evans stood up and contradicted him, his silence would be taken as acquiescence. Later, if he developed any qualms, they could say, But you were there, Evans. Why didn\u0027t you speak up then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me tell you something,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t even know\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just listen to me. Don\u0027t worry about it.\" She was looking directly into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she meant well, but despite her words, Evans was experiencing an unpleasant, sinking feeling. The police were threatening to issue a warrant for his arrest. The firm was complaining about his absences. Now this effort to force him into silenceby putting him on television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Why did you want me here so early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need you to sit in the hot seat again, as part of our test for jury selection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You have to. Same thing as before. Want some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look tired. Let\u0027s get you to hair and makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later he was back in the deposition room, at the end of the long table. There was again a crew of eager young scientific types looking down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today,\" Jennifer said, \"we would like to consider issues of global warming and land use. Are you familiar with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only slightly,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer nodded to one of the researchers at the far end. \"Raimundo? Will you give him the background?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researcher had a heavy accent, but Evans could follow him. \"It is well known,\" he said, \"that changes in land use will cause changes in average ground temperature. Cities are hotter than the surrounding countrysidewhat is called the urban heat island\u0027 effect. Croplands are warmer than forested lands, and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" Evans said. Nodding. He hadn\u0027t heard about these land use concepts, but it certainly stood to reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaimundo continued, \"A high percentage of weather stations that were out in the countryside forty years ago are now surrounded by concrete and skyscrapers and asphalt and so on. Which makes them register warmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Evans said. He glanced away, through the glass wall. He saw film crews moving around the warehouse, shooting various things. He hoped the crews wouldn\u0027t come in. He didn\u0027t want to sound stupid in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These facts,\" Raimundo said, \"are well known within the field. So researchers take the raw temperature data from stations near cities and reduce them by some amount to compensate for the urban heat island effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said, \"And how is this reduction calculated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different ways, depending on who does it. But most algorithms are based on population size. The larger the population, the greater the reduction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans shrugged. \"That sounds like the right way to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately,\" he said, \"it probably isn\u0027t. Do you know about Vienna? It was studied by Bohm a few years back. Vienna has had no increase in population since 1950, but it has more than doubled its energy use and increased living space substantially. The urban heat island effect has increased, but the calculated reduction is unchanged, because it only looks at population change.\"* \"So the heating from cities is being underestimated?\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s worse than that,\" Jennifer said. \"It used to be assumed that urban heating was unimportant because the urban heat island effect was only a fraction of total warming. The planet warmed about.3 degrees Celsius in the last thirty years. Cities are typically assumed to have heated by around.1 degree Celsius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So those assumptions are wrong. The Chinese report that Shanghai warmed 1 degree Celsius in the last twenty years alone. That\u0027s more than the total global warming of the planet in the last hundred years. And Shanghai is not unique. Houston increased.8 degrees Celsius in the last twelve years.! Cities in South Korea are heating rapidly.* Manchester, England, is now 8 degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside. Even small towns are much hotter than the surrounding areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer reached for her charts. \"Anyway,\" she said, \"the point is that the graphs you see are not raw data. They have already been adjusted with fudge factors to compensate for urban heating. But probably not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, the door opened and one of the four video crews came in, their camera light shining. Without hesitation, Jennifer reached for some charts, and brought them up. She whispered, \"B-roll is silent, so we need to be active and provide visuals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned toward the camera and said, \"Let me show you some examples of weather station data. Here, for instance, is a record of the average temperature for Pasadena since 1930.\"!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePasadena, CA 19302000 \"As you see,\" Jennifer said, \"a dramatic rise in temperature. And here is Berkeley since 1930.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerkeley, CA 19302000 \"A surprisingly incomplete record. But we are using raw data, so you can see missing years. And you see a clear warming trend. Indisputable, wouldn\u0027t you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would,\" Evans said, thinking that it wasn\u0027t much of a trendless than a degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, here is Death Valley, one of the hottest, driest places on Earth. No urbanization has occurred here. Again, missing years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath Valley, CA 19332000 Evans said nothing. It must be an anomaly, he thought. Jennifer put up more graphs:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGill, NV 19302000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuthrie, OK 19302000 \"These are stations from the Nevada desert and the Oklahoma plains,\" she said. \"They show temperatures that are flat, or declining. And not only rural areas. Here is Boulder, Colorado. It\u0027s only of interest because NCAR is located therethe National Center for Atmospheric Research, where so much global warming research is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoulder, CO 19301997 \"Here are some more small cities. Truman, Missouri, where the buck stops amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruman, MO 19312000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreenville, SC 19302000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn Arbor, MI 19302000 Evans said, \"Well, you have to admit, it\u0027s not very dramatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure what you consider dramatic. Truman has gotten colder by 2.5 degrees, Greenville by 1.5 degrees, Ann Arbor by one degree since1930. If the globe is warming, these places have been left out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s look at some bigger places,\" Evans said, \"like Charleston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I happen to have Charleston.\" She thumbed through her graphs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharleston, SC 19302000 Evans said, \"So, a bigger city gets warmer. What about New York?\" \"I have several records from New York, city and state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York, NY 19302000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSyracuse, NY 19302000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbany, NY 19302000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOswego, NY 19302000 \"As you see,\" Jennifer said, \"New York City is warmer, but many other parts of the state, from Oswego to Albany, have become colder since 1930.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans was acutely aware of the cameras on him. He nodded in what he hoped was a judicious, thoughtful manner and said, \"And where does this data come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the Historical Climatology Network data set,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a government dataset, maintained at Oak Ridge National Laboratories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Evans said. \"It\u0027s quite interesting. However, I\u0027d like to see the data from Europe and Asia. This is, after all, a global phenomenon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly,\" Jennifer said. She, too, was playing to the cameras. \"But before we do that, I\u0027d like your reaction to the data so far. As you can see, many places in the United States do not seem to have become warmer since 1930.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you cherry-picked your data,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To some degree. As we can be sure the defense will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the results do not surprise me,\" Evans said. \"Weather varies locally. It always has and always will.\" A thought occurred to him. \"By the way, why are all these graphs since 1930? Temperature records go much further back than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your point is well taken,\" Jennifer said, nodding. \"It definitely makes a difference how far back you go.
