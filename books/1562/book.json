On his way home from playing Santa Claus at the local lodge, Dale spies sneaky Lena uprooting his Monterey pines; he pulls a gun on her, she lashes out with a shovel and-oops!-kills him. Seven-year-old Josh Barker, thinking he\u0027s just seen the murder of Santa, prays for a miracle to save Christmas. To Lena\u0027s rescue comes Tucker Case, a slimy, reformed Casanova and DEA pilot, who gives her an alibi and sweeps her off her feet. The marijuana-cultivating town constable, Theo Crowe, suspects foul play, but Tucker intervenes with a blackmail scheme to keep the crime buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:58 PM"}
