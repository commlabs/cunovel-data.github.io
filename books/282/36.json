{"id":8625,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. PAUL SELLS THE MINE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;After a fatiguing trip Paul and his eccentric acquaintance reached Custer City. It was a rough journey, but Paul enjoyed it, and he was equally entertained and instructed by the comments of his traveling companion, who on his part formed a special liking for Paul. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you say you owned a hotel in Custer City, Mr. Scott?\" asked Paul, when they were near the end of the journey.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Jim Scott owns such a hotel,\" answered Mr. Scott, significantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Beg pardon, I mean Jim. If the price isn\u0027t high, I will stop there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The price is high and the accommodations very or\u0027nary,\" said Scott, frankly, \"but the price to you won\u0027t be anything. You\u0027ll be there as my company.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, but Jim, you won\u0027t make any money if you act so generously; but I thank you all the same.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to make any money out of you, youngster.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 247]\"I haven\u0027t done anything to deserve such kindness, Jim.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then we\u0027ll say you haven\u0027t. Look here, youngster, old Jim\u0027s been prospered, and he\u0027s got no one to spend his money on. It won\u0027t hurt him to give you free board, and he\u0027s goin\u0027 to do it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul grasped the rough hand of his new friend, and frankly accepted the offer, which acceptance Jim appeared to regard as a personal favor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was installed in a tolerably comfortable room in the Black Hills Hotel—as comfortable, at any rate, as the hotel, which was a rough-looking structure, afforded, and soon made himself at home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of course, curiosity soon induced him to roam about the town. It was composed of extemporaneous structures, for the town was as yet in its infancy, and built somewhat on the plan of Cheyenne, and other towns which he had seen along the union Pacific road. The town lots had been staked out sixty by one hundred and fifty feet in size, and the principal street, which had been named after General Crook, was two hundred feet wide. Other streets were a hundred and fifty feet wide. The \"city\" was certainly of mushroom growth, not less than four hundred buildings having been erected in a single month.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To Paul everything seemed new, strange, and delightful. It was a state of society to which he had not[Pg 248] been accustomed, and excited his curiosity and interest. He found that fashionable attire was not at all required in Custer City. Men went about dressed like day laborers of the humblest sort, who at home had been accustomed to the comforts and refinements of life. Everything was free and unconventional, and so everybody felt thoroughly independent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Some of the leading citizens lived in Jim Scott\u0027s hotel, which was pretty well filled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Occupying a room just opposite Paul\u0027s was a small, elderly man, with stiff, gray hair, a wizened face, and crafty eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who is my opposite neighbor, Jim?\" asked Paul, with some curiosity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, that\u0027s old Fox—Simeon Fox.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul pricked up his ears. He remembered that Mr. Bradford\u0027s partner in the Blackstone mine bore the name of Fox. If this was the man, he didn\u0027t doubt from his looks that he was capable of outwitting and swindling his employer. He didn\u0027t think it politic, however, just at present to show any particular interest in the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is his business?\" inquired Paul, in an indifferent tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He is part owner of one of our best mines.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is the name of the mine?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The Blackstone mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 249]\"You say he is part owner; who is the partner?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Some rich man in Chicago. Ten to one old Simeon will fleece him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose such a mine as that is worth considerable money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"About how much?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, youngster, you don\u0027t want to buy into it, do you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not in the present state of my finances,\" answered Paul, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, well, I\u0027d give thirty thousand dollars myself for the Blackstone mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thirty thousand dollars! That would make fifteen thousand dollars for a half interest, and Simeon Fox had tried to induce Mr. Bradford to sell his half for two thousand dollars! This was an obvious swindle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Would Mr. Fox sell out for that sum, do you think?\" asked Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s likely he wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027s making too much money out of it. But, youngster, you seem particularly interested in the mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am,\" answered Paul, quietly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had rapidly decided that it would be for his interest to reveal to Jim Scott his real business at Custer City.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, that\u0027s strange! What can it be to you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 250]\"Jim, can you keep a secret?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can I? I reckon!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I will tell you one. I am sent out here by Mr. Bradford, of Chicago, Simeon Fox\u0027s partner.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Scott whistled, and looked at Paul in evident amazement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He must have great confidence in you, youngster, to send out a boy of your age.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think he has,\" answered Paul, with pardonable pride. \"Now, I want to know if you will help me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In answer Mr. Scott put his hard and horny hand into the boy\u0027s, and said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can depend on Jim Scott every time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027ll tell you how the case stands. This Fox is continually sending on discouraging accounts about the mine to Mr. Bradford, and he lately offered him two thousand dollars for his half.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The mean cuss! I beg your pardon, that ain\u0027t the word I meant to use, but maybe its the best.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He thought Mr. Bradford would get discouraged, and sell out without taking any trouble to verify his statement.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I see.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But he suspected there was a conspiracy to cheat him, and he sent me out with full power to act for him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 251]\"That\u0027s a good \u0027un! And old Fox doesn\u0027t know of your bein\u0027 here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He has no idea that Mr. Bradford has sent a messenger.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall be glad to see the old rascal taken in.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Bradford gave five thousand dollars for his half of the mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And it was a good bargain at that price. But he never ought to have taken Simeon Fox as a partner.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What would you advise me to do, Jim?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You might take old Fox at his word, and buy his half for two thousand dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then the swindle would be on our side.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, because he proposed the trade.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Bradford is a rich man, and though he wants justice in the matter, he does not care to take any advantage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, Paul, I\u0027ll tell you what you\u0027d better do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What, Jim?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you full authority to act for Mr. Bradford?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, as I can show you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll take your word for it. Sell to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you willing to buy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, if you\u0027ll give me a good bargain?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What would you consider a good bargain, Jim?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll pay you twelve thousand dollars for the share you have to sell, money down, or my draft on Chicago.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 252]\"Will it be worth that to you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It will be worth more or I wouldn\u0027t buy, but it isn\u0027t worth that to your principal, for he can\u0027t be here to look after old Fox with his tricks.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He may try some of them on you, Jim.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll risk it. He\u0027ll find I get up in the morning as early as he does. To be plain with you, Paul, I\u0027ll make him an offer, give or take, and either way I shall make money. If the whole mine is in my hands I can make it pay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, Jim. I am ready to accept your offer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t much think,\" said Scott, laughing, \"when I came across you in Cheyenne, that I should buy a mine of you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You didn\u0027t think I carried one about with me?\" said Paul, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t let Simeon know about our bargain just yet.
