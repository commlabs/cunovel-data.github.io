Aria turned around and met his gaze. She stared at him for a long moment, trying to convey that breaking up was the only way she could make things right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel looked away. “I’ll walk you out,” he said, heading downstairs. He held the door open for her, and Aria mumbled good-bye and scuttled out. As she stepped off the porch, the box slipped from her grasp and spilled onto the brick path. She scrambled to pick up the spilled CDs, books, and T-shirts, and then felt a hand on her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here.” Noel leaned down, his voice softening. “I’ll get that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria allowed him to gather up her things and load them back into the box. When she stood up, she saw something move at the back of the Kahns’ property. Someone was skulking around by the guest house. At first, she feared it was A, but then a spotlight beamed down on the figure’s tall blond hairdo, frilly dress, and clunky heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure turned in the light, revealing her face. Aria tensed. It wasn’t Mrs. Kahn . . . it was Noel’s father. In drag. At home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria gasped before she could stop herself and, as if in slow motion, watched Noel’s head turn in the direction she was looking. “No!” she shouted, throwing herself in front of Noel to obstruct his view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Noel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I was . . .” Aria peeked over her shoulder. Mr. Kahn was gone. “I, um, thought I saw a bat swoop for your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel stared at her like she was nuts. A long, tense few seconds passed. Shrugging, he helped put Aria’s stuff in the back of her car, then turned toward the house. At the same time, the front door creaked open. Mr. Kahn had gotten through the house and to the front door, and now he stood on the porch in his lipstick and dress. He gawked at Noel, then Aria. The blood drained from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“D-Dad,” Noel stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he croaked, his voice gruff and deep. “I-I thought no one was home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Kahn did an about-face and marched back into the house. Aria covered her face in her hands. But surprisingly, Noel was making no noise at all. No gasps, no violent freak-outs, nothing. She peeked at him through her fingers. Instead of staring at the front door, which Mr. Kahn had just gone through, he was gaping at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You blocked my way,” he said. “You were trying to stop me from seeing my dad, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shifted her weight. “Well, yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel studied her for a long time. His eyes widened. “You knew, didn’t you? Before just now, I mean. You knew about how my dad dresses like . . . that. And you thought I didn’t know. You were keeping it from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria felt heat creep to her cheeks. “It wasn’t like that!” she cried. Then she stepped back. “Wait. You knew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yeah. I’ve known for years.” Noel’s eyes blazed. “How long have you known?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s chin wobbled. “Only a few days. I saw your dad at Fresh Fields last week. I was afraid to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you decided to break up with me instead?” Noel’s mouth was tight, and his eyes were wild. “Or was there some other mysterious reason why you did that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not!” Aria protested. “Please calm down! We can talk about this, can’t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, she was filled with hope. Maybe there was a silver lining to this. If Noel already knew about his dad, if this wasn’t some big, ruinous, earth-shattering revelation, A had nothing on her. It was just a bluff. “I’ve changed my mind. I was confused. I want to stay together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel barked out a cold, sinister laugh, the likes of which Aria had never heard before. “That train has left the station. I knew something was on your mind, Aria. I asked you a million times about it, and you told me you were fine. Just days ago I begged you to be honest with me about everything, and instead you lie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You lied, too!” Aria said, grasping at straws. “You never told me that your dad . . . you know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel’s eyes narrowed, as though he didn’t particularly like this shift of gears. “You never asked me. And, for the record, I was going to tell you. I just didn’t want to do it when we were at my house, and lately you’ve seemed so distracted, and . . .” He trailed off, his mouth dropping open. “Do you think it’s weird? Is that why you broke up with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noel, no!” Aria cried, grabbing for his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel wrenched away from her, a horrible twist of anger on his face. “And here I thought you were open-minded.” He spun around and went back inside, slamming the door so hard the house shook. A dreadful silence followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stared at her shaking hands, questioning if what had just happened was real. She waited for Noel to come back, but he didn’t. How had this happened? She thought she’d done the right thing, when she’d just made things a million times worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it hit her: Maybe A had meant for things to play out this way. Maybe A had known that Mr. Kahn’s cross-dressing was an open secret all along but led her to believe it would destroy Noel’s family. After all, the only thing that was worse than A ruining a relationship was Aria sabotaging it all on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOD-NO SHE DIDN’T\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spencer. Psst! Spencer!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer opened her eyes. She was lying on a small cot in the middle of a room that smelled pungently of antiseptic. Her limbs felt welded to the mattress, and she was certain someone had stuffed a torch down her throat. As her vision cleared, she saw a pretty girl with blond hair and big eyes standing at the foot of the bed. She was wearing a familiar yellow dress and had a knowing smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shot up, recognizing her instantly. “Tabitha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha spread out her arms. “Nice to see you again. How are you feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer touched her forehead. It felt wet, as though covered in sweat—or blood. “Not great. Where am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha giggled. “Don’t you remember what happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer tried to think, but her mind was a deep, black hole. “I don’t remember anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha’s heels rang out on the cold, hard floor as she stepped closer to Spencer. Her skin smelled like the same vanilla soap Ali used to use. “You’re here because of what you did,” she whispered, her breath hot on Spencer’s face. “What all of you did. She told me you’d pay for this, and she was right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, she? Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha pretended to zip her lips and throw away the key. “I swore I wouldn’t tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to me?” Spencer tried to move her legs under the covers, but they were strapped down with thick leather belts. “Where am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha rolled her eyes. “Do I have to spell everything out for you? I thought you were smart. You got into Princeton, after all. Not that you’ll be going there now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s eyes widened. “W-why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha’s smile was crooked and strange. “Because you’re dead.” And then she leaned over and touched Spencer’s eyes, as if to close them. “Say good-bye!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shrieked and fought to keep her eyes open, kicking against the leather restraints. When she opened her eyes again, she was in a different room. The walls were green, not pink. An IV pole and a bunch of whirring machines stood next to her bed, measuring her blood pressure and pulse. Just within reach was a small tray table containing a yellow plastic pitcher, her cell phone, and three round white pills. When Spencer looked at the cotton gown she was wearing, it was printed with the words PROPERTY OF PRINCETON GENERAL HOSPITAL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha’s voice reverberated in Spencer’s mind. It’s because of what you did. What all of you did. She told me you’d pay for this, and she was right. Was Tabitha talking about Gayle? But how did she and Gayle know each other? Or did she mean Real Ali?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, what the hell was she doing in a hospital? All she remembered was wandering to Ivy’s backyard and hearing something in the woods. There had been footsteps . . . someone had grabbed her . . . and then what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer monitor chirped. As if on cue, a nurse wearing blue scrubs and a terry-cloth headband entered the room. “Ah, you’re up.” The nurse looked at the machines, then shone a light in Spencer’s eyes. “Your name’s Spencer Hastings, right? Your driver’s license says you’re from Pennsylvania. Do you know what day it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer blinked. Everything was moving too quickly. “Um, Sunday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right.” The nurse wrote something down on the clipboard she was holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-what happened to me?” Spencer squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse placed a blood pressure cuff on Spencer’s arm. “You overdosed on a dangerous mix of drugs. We had to pump your stomach about an hour ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Spencer sat up in bed. “That’s impossible!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse sighed. “Well, your blood tested positive for marijuana, Ritalin, and LSD. The tox screen for the twenty-six other kids at the same party also tested positive for those substances, but they keep telling me they didn’t do any drugs, either.” She rolled her eyes. “I wish one of you would have just admitted it when we brought you in. It would’ve made our lives a lot easier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer licked her lips, which were so dry they hurt. More people from the party were here? “Is everyone okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone’s fine, but you all had a serious scare.” The nurse wrote something down on her clipboard, then patted Spencer’s leg. “You rest now, okay? Your body has been through a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door clicked closed, and Spencer was alone once more. She shifted around in the bed, making sure her legs weren’t strapped to the bed like they were in her dream. How did all of those other drugs get into her system? Not just hers, but twenty-six other kids, as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer closed her eyes and thought of the bizarre debauchery that had taken place at the potluck. How so many kids had paired up and disappeared upstairs. Straight-A students had stripped off their clothes and run naked through the house. Harper had started to trash the place, and others had followed. Even Spencer had done things she wouldn’t normally do. The whole experience was so . . . unhinged. Bizarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” Spencer blurted, a crack suddenly opening in her brain. Could it have been because of the brownies? They were the only thing she’d eaten. She pictured Reefer proffering her an enormous clump of pot, claiming it was really mellow and perfect for baking. He’d smiled at her, as though completely guileless and honest, then said all that stuff about Ivy. Maybe this was his idea of civil disobedience. He was sticking it to those old-fart-y institutions for being so staid, boring, and exclusionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer twisted her body to reach the cell phone on the little table and dialed Reefer’s phone number. It rang a few times, and then Reefer picked up, letting out a cautious hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You almost killed us,” she growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, excuse me?” Reefer said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stunning-pretty-little-liars-11/page-26.html","bookId":2387,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM"}
