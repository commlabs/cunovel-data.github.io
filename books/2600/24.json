The golem carried Zabel like a hurt child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they cleared the doorway, Zabel coughed and wiped his sweaty, ash-smudged eyes on a sleeve. \"Let me down, Lars. I can walk now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golem set him on the ground. Zabel leaned over, put his hands on his knees, gulped clean air. He stood straight and looked back at his home, flames in the windows and doorway. In the distance, the sirens grew louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many of his tools and materials, valuable items he\u0027d collected over a lifetime. All up in smoke. Damn them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replayed recent events in his mind. It had happened so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf had burst in and attacked him, would have likely savaged him to death if Lars hadn\u0027t pulled it off of him. Then Zabel had unleashed his most deadly spell, but the wolf had darted behind his desk, and the sturdy piece of furniture had absorbed the brunt of the firestorm. A second spell had blasted the beast back out the window, but not before half his office had been aflame. The smoke had overwhelmed him. He would surely have suffocated if Lars hadn\u0027t carried him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned the golem to follow him, and they ducked down an alley. Lars was not exactly inconspicuous, but Zabel had some quality ingredients stashed in his car. He could put together a few spells, form a plan to make them pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing was for sure. Sooner or later they\u0027d show up at the Vysehrad cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA particularly large raven perched atop a rusty weathervane across the street from Zabel\u0027s burning home. Everything it heard was heard by its master, Jackson Fay. Everything the raven saw, Fay saw. Everything it tasted, Fay tasted. This included a caterpillar and two especially sour black beetles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay didn\u0027t enjoy that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raven watched as Zabel emerged from the smoking doorway, then led his wooden behemoth down a back alley. He wondered why Zabel had used wood. Maybe that was all that had been handy. Cheap material. Economical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Pascal had not returned from Prague, Fay had strongly suspected he would need to pay Zabel a visit. Probably the man knew something of the stone as well. Whatever Zabel knew, Fay would know soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay watched as Zabel instructed the golem to lie down in the back of an older model Mercedes. He threw a blanket over the golem, then climbed into the driver\u0027s seat, started the car, and began to drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay commanded the raven to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel would be a good test of Fay\u0027s strength. Zabel was a decent enough wizard, but Fay felt confident he had the edge in talent and experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d make damn well sure he had the element of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret floated through the gray void. She regretted the spell that had put her in this predicament. Her motivations were good-to warn her fellow Society members they might be in harm\u0027s way. Fay was a dangerous rogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one last task kept her tethered to the real world. She had to find Amy. But really, what did she care anymore? The balance of magic. Evil wizards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch worries were for the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls were mint green and chipped. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. A twenty-year-old refrigerator rattled its swan song in the corner. Allen looked at the furniture, the chairs, the table; wooden and plain, scratched. A countertop next to the fridge held what appeared to be the first ever coffeemaker to roll off the assembly line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommie surplus. That made him chuckle. He put his head down on the table, tried not to see Penny\u0027s limp body, tried not to hear the explosion again, glass and bits of brick raining down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul had taken him across town, to the basement of a small Catholic church. The rooms below were surprisingly plain and bureaucratic, like the offices for the Department of Motor Vehicles in his hometown. Bland and depressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen heard somebody come in the room, and he picked his head up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s doing fine,\" Father Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sighed relief, sank in his chair. He was suddenly exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can absorb a lot of abuse in wolf form,\" said the priest. \"You saw Zabel cast the spell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen shook his head. \"Just the aftermath. I told you. I was down on the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Father Paul lit a cigarette. \"Just double checking some things. Quite a story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen looked around the room. \"What is this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul blew out a long stream of cigarette smoke before answering. \"It was built by a secret order of albino monks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest laughed. \"I\u0027m just fucking with you. KGB. It was the KGB who built it, back during the iron curtain days. The church was a trap to spy on Catholic dissidents. There was a group of priests back then opposing Soviet rule. Anyway, the bishop arranged for us to use the place for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I under arrest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul shook his head. \"We\u0027re priests, Allen. Not cops. We can\u0027t arrest anyone. I mean, we can kill you, but not arrest you. But don\u0027t worry, we won\u0027t kill you either. We really were trying to rescue you when we busted into the Society safe house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Penny said too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want some coffee?\" asked Father Paul. \"I\u0027m going to have some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a Coke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest got up and looked in the fridge. \"No Coke. Pepsi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul poured himself a cup of coffee in a paper cup, brought Allen a can of Pepsi, and sat down again. He puffed the cigarette, waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At first I just wanted to go home,\" Allen said. \"But now...\" He shrugged. \"I\u0027m not sure how to explain it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen thought for a moment, then said, \"I don\u0027t want to go home not knowing how all this turned out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul smiled. \"We should make a Jesuit out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen smiled too. \"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your other friend. What\u0027s up with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of that Society lot,\" Father Paul said. \"She doesn\u0027t much care for my type.\" Father Paul tapped his white collar with his pinkie finger. \"You think we can get her to work with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t say,\" Allen admitted. \"Do you need her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Society and the Vatican are on the same page for this one. Nobody wants to see the philosopher\u0027s stone fall into the wrong hands. Nobody\u0027s exactly sure what the damn thing can do.\" A pause for a cigarette puff. \"You\u0027ve told me what you read in the Kelley diary, the caverns beneath St. Vitus and the strange machine the astrologer built. Why do you think the vampire wants the stone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen felt his eye twitch and looked away. He felt uncomfortable discussing Cassandra. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never mentioned anything while you were... together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul nodded slowly. \"Okay.\" Puff. \"You want to see her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen\u0027s eyes widened. See her? Of course not! And yet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Penny, I mean,\" the priest said. \"She\u0027s up and around now, I think. I know you were worried about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sighed and nodded. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul pushed away from the table. \"Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priests had stashed Amy in a small office. A desk, a chair, a small bathroom. They\u0027d politely given her a bottle of water when she\u0027d asked for a drink. They hadn\u0027t treated her like the enemy, but it was clear they meant for her to stay put until they were ready to deal with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Allen? Was Penny okay? All she could do was pace the tiny, bland room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually her bladder forced her into the small bathroom. She peed, washed her hands at the sink. She lingered, massaging the warm soap into her palms, rubbed the knuckles. She looked at herself and was surprised she didn\u0027t appear more haggard. She felt like she could sleep for days. The cracked mirror above the sink fogged over, the room becoming suddenly chill. Her arms and legs breaking out in gooseflesh. Her breath came out as fog too. The bathroom was suddenly freezing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting appeared in the fog on the mirror: Are you Amy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s eyes grew big. Oh, shit. She held her breath, not knowing what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore writing: Hello? Are you there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Amy,\" she said in a small voice. \"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apparition came into focus slowly, right in front of Amy-an old woman with hollow eyes, skin tight across her face, making her look nearly skeletal. Her features were pinched and jagged. \"Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me, Amy. Margaret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy gasped. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What year is it?\" the ghost asked. \"So long. So many years wandering, looking for you. I got lost in there. You can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027s like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind. It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Margaret\u0027s ghost said. \"I\u0027ve found you. I can rest. Fulfill my purpose and rest at long last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy hugged herself, shivering now. \"I d-don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Society is smashed,\" the ghost told her. \"Fay has betrayed us. Beware of him. The Council is broken. He murdered me, Amy. I hung on to warn as many as I could. I have to go now. So long since I\u0027ve felt the sun on my skin. I must fade now into the gray. It\u0027s pulling me. Like some kind of cosmic undertow.\" She began to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"W-wait,\" Amy called after her. \"What d-do I do now? I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going now.\" The ghost\u0027s voice was a faint echo. \"It\u0027s taking me. Beware of Fay. Beware.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost vanished totally. Amy shivered, waited another few seconds but nothing else happened. She stumbled out of the bathroom and into the warmth, sat at the little desk, blowing on her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to cry, not even completely sure who she was crying for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul led Allen down a short hall to another door. Finnegan leaned against the wall waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought her some clothes,\" Finnegan said. \"She\u0027s putting them on now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul knocked. \"You decent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" Penny called from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey opened the door and entered. Penny wore a pair of blue gym shorts and a tourist T-shirt with the Czech flag on the front. Allen noticed Penny\u0027s legs, pale but smooth and well-toned. He noticed things like that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny bent over, tying a pair of white deck shoes. She stood and grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Allen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My ribs are bruised,\" she said, \"but it could have been a lot worse. I\u0027ll make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny handed a large, red bra back to Finnegan. \"I appreciate that you think I can fill this thing, but I think I\u0027ll skip it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheepish grin made the big priest look like some humble, friendly farmer. \"Sorry, lass. I don\u0027t have a lot of experience buying such things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re all glad to hear that,\" Father Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared the hell out of me,\" Allen said gently. \"Glad you\u0027re not dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile flickered across Penny\u0027s face. \"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Amy entered with a tall black priest behind her. Amy saw Penny and flashed her a big smile. \"You\u0027re okay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few bumps,\" Penny said. \"I\u0027ve had worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for bringing her, Father Starkes.\" Father Paul turned to Amy. \"The Society and the Vatican have often been adversaries, young lady. But I think this time we need to work together. Perhaps if I could convince-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help you,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul blinked. \"At the very least, I thought you\u0027d need to check with your Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy sighed. \"No. I don\u0027t need to check with them anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul rubbed his hands together. \"Okay, then. Let\u0027s go dig up a dead guy.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-24.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
