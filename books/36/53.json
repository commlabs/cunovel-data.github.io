Are You saying we should never make promises—that we should never promise anything to anyone?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs most of you are now living your life, there is a lie built into every promise. The lie is that you can know now how you will feel about a thing, and what you will want to do about that thing, on any given tomorrow. You cannot know this if you are living your life as a reactive being—which most of you are. Only if you are living life as a creative being can your promise not contain a lie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCreative beings can know how they are going to feel about a thing at any time in the future, because creative be-ings create their feelings, rather than experiencing them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUntil you can create your future, you cannot predict your future. Until you can predict your future, you can-not promise anything truthfully about it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet even one who both creates and predicts her fu-ture has the authority and the rightto change. Change is a fundamental right of all creatures. Indeed, it is more than a “right,” for a “right” is that which is given. “Change” is that which Is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eChange is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat which is change, you are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot be given this. You are this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, since you are “change”—and since change is the only thing constant about you—you cannot truth-fully promise to always be the same.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo You mean there are no constants in the universe? Are You saying that there is nothing which remains constant in all of creativity?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe process you call life is a process of re-creation. All of life is constantly re-creating itself anew in each moment of now. In this process identicality is impossi-ble, since if a thing is identical, it has not changed at all. Yet while identicality is impossible, similarity is not. Similarity is the result of the process of change produc-ing a remarkably similar version of what went before.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen creativity reaches a high level of similarity, you call that identicality. And from the gross perspec-tive of your limited viewpoint, it is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, in human terms, there appears to be great constancy in the universe. That is, things seem to look alike, and act alike, and react alike. You see consis-tency here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is good, for it provides a framework within which you may consider, and experience, your exis-tence in the physical.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet I tell you this. Viewed from the perspective of all life—that which is physical and that which is nonphysi-cal—the appearance of constancy disappears. Things are experienced as they really are: constantly changing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are saying that sometimes the changes are so delicate, so subtle, that from our less discerning viewpoint they appear the same—sometimes exactly the same—when, in fact, they are not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePrecisely.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are “no such things as identical twins.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. You have captured it perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet we can re-create ourselves anew in a form sufficiently similar to produce the effect of constancy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd we can do this in human relationships, in terms of Who We Are, and how we behave.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes—although most of you find this very difficult. Because true constancy (as opposed to the appear-ance of constancy) violates the natural law, as we have just learned, and it takes a great master to even create the appearance of identicality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA master overcomes every natural tendency (remem-ber, the natural tendency is toward change) to show up as identicality. In truth, he cannot show up identically from moment to moment. But she can show up as sufficiently similar to create the appearance of being identical.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet people who are not “masters” show up “identically” all the time. I know people whose behaviors and appearance are so predictable you can stake your life on them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet it takes great effort to do this intentionally. The master is one who creates a high level of similar-ity (what you call “consistency”) intentionally. A student is one who creates consistency without necessarily in-tending to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA person who always reacts the same way to certain circumstances, for instance, will often say, “1 couldn’t help it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA master would never say that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven if a person’s reaction produces an admirable behavior—something for which they receive praise— their response will often be “Well, it was nothing. It was automatic, really. Anybody would do it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA master would never do that, either.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA master, therefore, is a person who—quite liter-ally—knows what he is doing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe also knows why.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople not operating at levels of mastery often know neither.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is why it is so difficult to keep promises?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is one reason. As I said, until you can predict your future, you cannot promise anything truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA second reason people find it difficult to keep promises is that they come into conflict with authentic-ity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat do You mean?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI mean that their evolving truth about a thing differs from what they said their truth would always be. And so, they are deeply conflicted. What to obey—my truth, or my promise?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAdvice?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have given you this advice before:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBetrayal of yourself in order not to betray another is betrayal nonetheless. It is the highest betrayal.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut this would lead to promises being broken all over the place! Nobody’s word on anything would matter. Nobody could be counted on for anything!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, so you’ve been counting on others to keep their word, have you? No wonder you’ve been so miserable.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWho says I’ve been miserable?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou mean this is the way you look and act when you’ve been happy?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll right. Okay. So I’ve been miserable. Sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, a great deal of the time. Even when you’ve had every reason to be happy, you’ve allowed yourself to be miserable-worrying about whether you’ll be able to hold onto your happiness!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd the reason you’ve even had to worry about this is that “holding onto your happiness” has depended to a large degree on other people keeping their word.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou mean I don’t have a right to expect-or at least hope—that other people will keep their word?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhy would you want such a right?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe only reason that anther person would not keep their word to you would be because they didn’t want to—or they felt they couldn’t, which is the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd if a person did not want to keep his word to you, or for some reason felt he just couldn’t, why on Earth would you want him to?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo you really want someone to keep an agreement she does not want to keep? Do you really feel people should be forced to do things they don’t feel they can do?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhy would you want to force anyone to do any-thing against his will?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, try this for a reason: because to let them get away with not doing what they said they were going to do would hurt me—or my family.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo in order to avoid injury, you’re willing to inflict injury.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI don’t see how it injures another simply to ask him to keep his word.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet he must see it as injurious, or he would keep it willingly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo I should suffer the injury, or watch my children and fam-ily suffer the injury, rather than “injure” the one who made a promise by simply asking that it be kept?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo you really think that if you force another to keep a promise that you will have escaped injury?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI tell you this: More damage has been done to others by persons leading lives of quiet desperation (that is, doing what they felt they “had” to do) than ever was done by persons freely doing what they wanted to do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you give a person freedom, you remove dan-ger, you don’t increase it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, letting someone “off the hook” on a promise or commitment made to you may look like it will hurt you in the short run, but it will never damage you in the long run, because when you give the other person their free-dom, you give yourself freedom as well. And so now you are free of the agonies and the sorrows, the attacks on your dignity and your self-worth that inevitably fol-low when you force another person to keep a promise to you that he or she does not want to keep.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe longer damage will far outweigh the shorter— as nearly everyone who has tried to hold another per-son to their word has discovered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDoes this same idea hold true in business as well? How could the world do business that way?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eActually it is the only sane way to do business.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe problem right now in your whole society is that it is based on force. Legal force (which you call the “force of law”) and, too often, physical force (which you call the world’s “armed forces”).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have not yet learned to use the art of persuasion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf not by legal force—the “force of law” through the courts—how would we “persuade” businesses to meet the terms of their contract and keep their agreements?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGiven your current cultural ethic, there may not be another way. Yet with a change of cultural ethic, the way you are now seeking to keep businesses—and indi-viduals, for that matter—from breaking their agree-ments will appear very primitive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCan You explain?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are now using force to make sure agreements are kept. When your cultural ethic is changed to include an\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eunderstanding that you are all One, you would never use force, because that would only damage your Self. You would not slap your left hand with your right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven if the left hand was strangling you?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is another thing which would not happen. You would stop strangling your Self. You would stop biting your nose to spite your face. You would stop breaking your agreements. And, of course, your agreements themselves would be much different.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou would not agree to give something of value which you have to another only if they had something of value to give you in exchange. You would never hold back on giving or sharing something until you got what you call a just return.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou would give and share automatically, and so, there would be far fewer contracts to break, because a contract is about the exchange of goods and services, whereas your life would be about the giving of goods and services, regardless of what exchange may or may not take place.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet in this kind of one-way giving would your salva-tion be found, for you would have discovered what God has experienced: that what you give to another, you give to your Self. What goes around, comes around.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll things that proceed from you, return to you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSevenfold. So there is no need to worry about what you are going to “get back.” There is only a need to worry about what you are going to “give out.” Life is about creating the highest quality giving, not the highest quality getting.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou keep forgetting. But life is not “for getting.” Life is “for giving,” and in order to do that, you need to be forgiving to others—especially those who did not give you what you thought you were going to get!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis switch will entail a complete shift of your cul-tural story. Today, what you call “success” in your cul-ture is measured largely by how much you “get,” by how much honor and money and power and posses-sions you amass. In the New Culture “success” will be measured by how much you cause others to amass.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe irony will be that the more you cause others to amass, the more you will amass, effortlessly. With no “contracts,” no “agreements,” no “bargaining” or “ne-gotiating” or lawsuits or courts which force you to give to each other what was “promised.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the future economy, you will not do things for personal profit, but for personal growth, which will be your profit. Yet “profit” in material terms will come to you as you become a bigger and grander version of Who You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn those days and times, using force to coerce some-one to give you something because they “said” that they would will seem very primitive to you. If another person does not keep an agreement, you will simply al-low them to walk their path, make their choices, and create their own experience of themselves. And what-ever they have not given you, you will not miss, for you will know that there is “more where that came from”—and that they are not your source of that, but you are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. I got it. But it feels like we have really gotten off the mark. This whole discussion began with my asking You about love—and if human beings would ever allow themselves to ex-press it without limitation. And that led to a question about open marriage. And suddenly we’ve gotten way off the mark here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot really. Everything we’ve talked about is perti-nent. And this is a perfect lead-in to your questions about so-called enlightened, or more highly evolved, societies. Because in highly evolved societies there is neither “marriage” nor “business”—nor, for that matter, any of the artificial social constructions you have cre-ated to hold your society together.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, well, we’ll get into that soon. Right now I just want to close down this subject. You’ve said some intriguing things here. What all of it breaks down to, as I get it, is that most hu-man beings can’t keep promises and so, shouldn’t make them. That pretty much scuttles the institution of marriage.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI like your use of the word “institution” here. Most people experience that when they are in a marriage, they are in an “institution.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it’s either a mental health institution or a penal insti-tution—or at the very least an institution of higher learning!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. Precisely. That’s how most people experi-ence it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I was kidding along with You here, but I wouldn’t say “most people.” There are still millions of people who love the institution of marriage, and want to protect it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’ll stand by the statement. Most people have a very difficult time with marriage, and do not like what it does to them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour worldwide divorce statistics prove this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo are You saying that marriage should go?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have no preference in the matter, only—\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e—I know, I know. Observations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBravo! You keep wanting to make me a God of pref-erences, which I am not.

A bargain was struck. You give me this and I’ll give you that. In this it was very much like a business. A contract was made.

That is the nature of Who You Are. You are unlimited, eternal, and free, by nature.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, any artificial social, moral, religious, philo-sophical, economic, or political construction which vio-lates or subordinates your nature is an impingement upon your very Self—and you will rail against it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you suppose gave birth to your own coun-try?

If you didn’t need this guarantee, you would not need marriage. And how do you use this guarantee? First, as a means of creating security (instead of creating security from that which is inside of you), and second, if that security is not forever forthcoming, as a means of punishing each other, for the marriage promise which has been broken can now form the basis of the lawsuit which has been opened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have thus found marriage very useful—even if it is for all the wrong reasons.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMarriage is also your attempt to guarantee that the feelings you have for each other, you will never have for another.

It’s not a question of “right” or “wrong.” Right and wrong do not exist. It’s a question of what serves you. Of what re-creates you in the next grandest image of Who You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf Who You Really Are is a being who says, “This one relationship—this single one, right over here-is more special than any other,” then your construction of mar-riage allows you to do that perfectly. Yet you might find it interesting to notice that almost no one who is, or has been, recognized as a spiritual master is married.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYeah, because masters are celibate.

It is the height of irony that you feel this is the ho-liest of holy promises, for it is a promise that God would never make.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet, in order to justify your human fears, you have imagined a God who acts just like you. Therefore, you speak of God’s “promise” to his “Chosen People,” and of covenants between God and those God loves, in a special way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot stand the thought of a God who loves no one in a way which is more special than any other, and so you create fictions about a God who only loves cer-tain people for certain reasons. And you call these fic-tions Religions. I call them blasphemies. For any thought that God loves one more than another is false-and any ritual which asks you to make the same statement is not a sacrament, but a sacrilege.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God, stop it. Stop it! You’re killing every good thought I ever had about marriage! This can’t be God writing this.

I tell you this: You have bastardized the Word of God in order to justify your fears and ra-tionalize your insane treatment of each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou will make God say whatever you need God to say in order to continue limiting each other, hurting each other, and killing each other in My name.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYea, you have invoked My name, and waved My flag, and carried crosses on your battlefields for centu-ries, all as proof that I love one people more than an-other, and would ask you to kill to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet I tell you this: My love is unlimited and uncondi-tional.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is the one thing you cannot hear, the one truth you cannot abide, the one statement you cannot ac-cept, for its all-inclusiveness destroys not only the insti-tution of marriage (as you have constructed it), but every one of your religions and governmental institu-tions as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor you have created a culture based on exclusion, and supported it with a cultural myth of a God who ex-cludes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet the culture of God is based on inclusion. In God’s love, everyone is included. Into God’s Kingdom everyone is invited.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd this truth is what you call a blasphemy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd you must. Because if it is true, then everything you have created in your life is false.

And I will concede that, because some of this language has also been used by you when you are being judgmental , it would be easy to conclude that I’m being judgmental when I use them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet Me assure you here that I am not. Throughout this whole dialogue I have simply been trying to tell you how to get where you say you want to go, and to de-scribe as impactfully as possible what is blocking your way; what is stopping you from going there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, with regard to religion, you say where you want to go is to a place where you can truly know God and love God. I am simply observing that your religions do not take you there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour religions have made God the Great Mystery, and caused you not to love God, but to fear God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eReligion has done little, as well, to cause you to change your behaviors. You are still killing each other, condemning each other, making each other “wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, in fact, it is your religions which have been encour-aging you to do so.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo with regard to religion, I merely observe that you say you want it to take you to one place, and it is taking you to another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow you say you want marriage to take you to the land of eternal bliss, or at least to some reasonable level of peace, security, and happiness. As with religion, your invention called marriage does well with this in the early going, when you are first experiencing it. Yet, as with re-ligion, the longer you reside in the experience, the more it takes you where you say you don’t want to go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNearly half of the people who become married dis-solve their marriage through divorce, and of those who stay married, many are desperately unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour “unions of bliss” lead you to bitterness, anger, and regret.

Until they change, nothing else will change. For your cultural myths inform your ethics, and your ethics create your behaviors. Yet the problem is that your cultural myth is at variance with your basic instinct.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat do You mean?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour First Cultural Myth is that human beings are in-herently evil. This is the myth of original sin. The myth holds that not only is your basic nature evil, you were born that way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Second Cultural Myth, arising necessarily out of the first, is that it is the “fittest” who survive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis second myth holds that some of you are strong and some of your are weak, and that to survive, you have to be one of the strong. You will do all that you can to help your fellow man, but if and when it comes down to your own survival, you will take care of yourself first. You will even let others die. Indeed, you will go further than that. If you think you have to, in order for you and yours to survive, you will actually kill others—presuma-bly, the “weak”—thereby defining you as the “fittest.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome of you say that this is your basic instinct. It is called the “survival instinct,” and it is this cultural myth that has formed much of your societal ethic, creating many of your group behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet your “basic instinct” is not survival, but rather, fairness, oneness, and love. This is the basic instinct of all sentient beings everywhere. It is your cellular mem-ory. It is your inherent nature. Thus is exploded your first cultural myth. You are not basically evil, you were not born in “original sin.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf your “basic instinct” was “survival,” and if your ba-sic nature was “evil,” you would never move instinc-tively to save a child from falling, a man from drowning, or anyone from anything. And yet, when you act on your basic instincts and display your basic nature, and don’t think about what you are doing, this is exactly how you behave, even at your own peril.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, your “basic” instinct cannot be “survival,” and your basic nature is clearly not “evil.” Your instinct and your nature is to reflect the essence of Who You Are, which is fairness, oneness, and love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the social implications of this, it is impor-tant to understand the difference between “fairness” and “equality.” It is not a basic instinct of all sentient beings to seek equality, or to be equal. Indeed, exactly the opposite is true.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe basic instinct of all living things is to express uniqueness, not sameness. Creating a society in which two beings are truly equal is not only impossible, but undesirable. Societal mechanisms seeking to produce true equality—in other words, economic, political, and social “sameness”—work against, not for, the grandest idea and the highest purpose—which is that each being will have the opportunity to produce the outcome of its grandest desire, and thus truly re-create itself anew.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEquality of opportunity is what is required for this, not equality in fact. This is called fairness. Equality in fact, produced by exterior forces and laws, would elimi-nate, not produce, fairness. It would eliminate the op-portunity for true self-re-creation, which is the highest goal of enlightened beings everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd what would create freedom of opportunity? Systems that would allow society to meet the basic sur-vival needs of every individual, freeing all beings to pur-sue self-development and self-creation, rather than self-survival. In other words, systems that imitate the true system, called life, in which survival is guaranteed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, because self-survival is not an issue in enlight-ened societies, these societies would never allow one of its members to suffer if there were enough for all. In these societies self-interest and mutual best interest are identical.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo society created around a myth of “inherent evil-ness\" or “survival of the fittest” could possibly achieve such understanding.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, I see this. And this “cultural myth” question is some-thing I want to explore, along with the behaviors and ethics of more advanced civilizations, later in greater detail. But I’d like to double back one last time and resolve the questions I started Out with here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne of the challenges of talking with You is that Your an-swers lead us in such interesting directions that I sometimes\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eforget where I began. But in this case I have not. We were dis-cussing marriage. We were discussing love, and its requirements.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLove has no requirements. That’s what makes it love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf your love for another carries requirements, then it is not love at all, but some counterfeit version.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is what I have been trying to tell you here, It is what I have been saying, in a dozen different ways, with every question you’ve asked here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithin the context of marriage, for example, there is an exchange of vows that love does not require. Yet you require them, because you do not know what love is. And so you make each other promise what love would never ask.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen You are against marriage!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am “against” nothing. I am simply describing what I see.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow you can change what I see. You can redesign your social construction called “marriage” so that it does not ask what Love would never ask, but rather, de-clares what only love could declare.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, change the marriage vows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMore than that. Change the expectations on which the vows are based. These expectations are going to be difficult to change, because they are your cultural heri-tage. They arise, in turn, from your cultural myths.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere we go again with the cultural myths routine: What’s up with You about this?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am hoping to point you in the right direction here. I see where you say you want to go with your society, and I am hoping to find human words and human terms that can direct you there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMay I give you an example?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePlease.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne of your cultural myths about love is that it’s about giving rather than receiving. This has become a cultural imperative. And yet it is driving you crazy, and causing more damage than you could ever imagine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt gets, and keeps, people in bad marriages, it causes relationships of all kinds to be dysfunctional, yet no one—not your parents, to whom you look for guid-ance; not your clergy, to whom you look for inspiration; not your psychologists and psychiatrists, to whom you look for clarity; not even your writers and artists, to whom you look for intellectual leadership, will dare to challenge the prevailing cultural myth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, songs are written, stories are told, movies are made, guidance is given, prayers are offered, and parenting is done which perpetuates The Myth. Then you are all left to live up to it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd you can’t.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet it is not you that is the problem, it is The Myth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLove is not about giving rather than receiving?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt isn’t?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo. It never has been.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut You said Yourself just a moment ago that “Love has no requirements.” You said, that’s what makes it love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, that sure sounds like “giving rather than receiving” to me!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen you need to reread Chapter Eight of Book 1. Everything I’m alluding to here I’ve explained to you\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethere. This dialogue was meant to be read in sequence, and to be considered as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI know. But for those who nevertheless came to these words now without having read Book 1; could You explain, please, what You’re getting at here? Because, frankly, even I could use the review, and I think I now understand this stuff!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Here goes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEverything you do, you do for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is true because you and all others are One.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat you do for another, you therefore do for you. What you fail to do for another, you fail to do for you. What is good for another is good for you, and what is bad for another is bad for you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the most basic truth. Yet it is the truth you most frequently ignore.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow when you are in a relationship with another, that relationship has only one purpose. It exists as a ve-hicle for you to decide and to declare, to create and to express, to experience and to fulfill your highest notion of Who You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow if Who You Really Are is a person who is kind and considerate, caring and sharing, compassionate and loving—then, when you are being these things with others, you are giving your Self the grandest experience for which you came into the body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is why you took a body. Because only in the physical realm of the relative could you know yourself as these things. In the realm of the absolute from which you have come, this experience of knowing is impossible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll these things I’ve explained to you in far greater detail in Book 1.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow if Who You Really Are is a being who does not love the Self, and who allows the Self to be abused, damaged, and destroyed by others, then you will con-tinue behaviors which allow you to experience that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet if you really are a person who is kind and consid-erate, caring and sharing, compassionate and loving, you will include your Self among the people with whom you are being these things.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, you will start with yourself. You will put yourself first in these matters.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEverything in life depends on what you are seeking to be. If, for instance, you are seeking to be One with all others (that is, if you are seeking to experience a con-ceptualization you already know to be true), you will find yourself behaving in a very specific way—a way which allows you to experience and demonstrate your Oneness. And when you do certain things as a result of this, you will not experience that you are doing some-thing for someone else, but rather, that you are doing it for your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe same will be true no matter what you are seek-ing to be. If you are seeking to be love, you will do loving things with others. Not for others, but with others.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNotice the difference. Catch the nuance. You will be doing loving things with others, for your Self—so that you can actualize and experience your grandest idea about your Self and Who You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn this sense, it is impossible to do anything for an-other, for every act of your own volition is literally just that: an “act.” You are acting. That is, creating and play-ing a role. Except, you are not pretending. You are actu-ally being it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are a human being. And what you are being is decided and chosen by you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour Shakespeare said it: All the world’s a stage, and the people, the players.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe also said, “To be or not to be, that is the ques-tion.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd he also said: “To thine own Self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you are true to your Self, when you do not betray your Self, then when it “looks like” you are “giv-ing,” you will know you are actually “receiving.” You are literally giving yourself back to your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot truly “give” to another, for the simple reason that there is no “other.” If We are all One, then there is only You.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis sometimes seems like a semantic “trick,” a way to change the words around to alter their meaning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is not a trick, but it is magic! And it is not about changing words to alter meaning, but changing percep-tions to alter experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour experience of everything is based on your per-ceptions, and your perception is based on your under-standing. And your understanding is based on your myths. That is, on what you have been told.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow I tell you this: Your present cultural myths have not served you. They have not taken you where you say you want to go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEither you are lying to yourself about where you say you want to go, or you are blind to the fact that you are not getting there. Not as an individual, not as a country, not as a species or a race.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre there others species which are?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh yes, decidedly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I’ve waited long enough.

But first I want to tell you about how you can alter your invention called “marriage,” so that it takes you closer to where you say you want to go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo not destroy it, do not do away with it—alter it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, well, I do want to know about that. I do want to know whether there is any way that human beings will ever be al-lowed to express true love. So I end this section of our dialogue where I began it. What limits shall we—indeed, some would say must we—place on that expression?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNone. No limits at all.
