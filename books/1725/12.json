Had that passenger been one of the Great Squires themselves, he might still have counted on co-operation. A Great Squire might be all-powerful on his own continent, but on a ship he would recognize that there could be only one master, the Captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman was different. Any woman. And a woman who was daughter of a Great Squire was completely impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"My Lady, how can I allow you to interview them in private?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia of Fife, her dark eyes snapping, said, \"Why not? Are they armed, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. That\u0027s not the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone can see they\u0027re only a pair of very frightened creatures. They\u0027re half scared to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frightened people can be very dangerous, my Lady. They can\u0027t he counted on to act sensibly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you keep them frightened?\" She had the tiniest stammer when she was angry. \"You\u0027ve got three tremendous sailors standing over them with blasters, poor things. Captain, I\u0027ll not forget this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she wouldn\u0027t, the Captain thought. He could feel himself beginning to give way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Your Ladyship pleases, will you tell me exactly what it is that you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s simple. I\u0027ve told you. I want to speak to them. If they\u0027re Florinians, as you say they are, I can get tremendously valuable information from them for my book. I can\u0027t do that, though, if they\u0027re too frightened to speak. If I could be with them alone it would be fine. Alone, Captain! Can you understand a simple word? Alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what would I say to your father, my Lady, if he discovers that I allowed you to remain unguarded in the presence of two desperate criminals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Desperate criminals! Oh, Great Space! Two poor fools that tried to escape their planet and had no more sense than to board a ship going to Sark! Besides, how would my father know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they hurt you he would know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should they hurt me?\" Her small fist lifted and vibrated, while she put every atom of force she could find into her voice. \"I demand it, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Racety said, \"How about this then, my Lady? I will be present. I shall not be three sailors with blasters. I shall be one man with no blaster in view. Otherwise\"-and in his turn he put all his resolution into his voice-\"I must refuse your demand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, then.\" She was breathless. \"Very well. But if I can\u0027t get them to speak because of you I will personally see to it that you captain no more ships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona put her hand hastily over Rik\u0027s eyes as Samia entered the brig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, girl?\" asked Samia sharply, before she could remember that she was going to speak to them comfortingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona spoke with difficulty. She said, \"He is not bright, Lady. He wouldn\u0027t know you were a Lady. He might have looked at you. I mean without intending any harm, Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, goodness,\" said Samia. \"Let him look.\" She went on, \"Must they stay here, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you prefer a stateroom, my Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said, \"Surely you could manage a cell not quite so grim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is grim to you, my Lady. To them, I am sure this is luxury. There is running water here. Ask them if there was any in their hut on Florina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, tell those men to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain motioned to them. They turned, stepping out nimbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain set down the light aluminum folding chair he had brought with him. Samia took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said brusquely to Rik and Valona, \"Stand up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia broke in instantly. \"No! Let them sit. You\u0027re not to interfere, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to them. \"So you are a Floninian, girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona shook her head. \"We\u0027re from Wotex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You needn\u0027t be frightened. It doesn\u0027t matter that you\u0027re from Florina. No one will hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re from Wotex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you see that you\u0027ve practically admitted you\u0027re from Florina, girl? Why did you cover the boy\u0027s eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not allowed to look at a Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if he\u0027s from Wotex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia let her think about it. She tried to smile in a friendly way. Then she said, \"Only Florinians aren\u0027t allowed to look at Ladies. So you see you\u0027ve admitted that you\u0027re a Florinian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona burst out, \"He\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am. But he\u0027s not. Don\u0027t do anything to him. He really isn\u0027t a Floriian. He was just found one day. I don\u0027t know where he comes from, but it\u0027s not Florina.\" Suddenly she was almost voluble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia looked at her with some surprise. \"Well, I\u0027ll speak to him. What\u0027s your name, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik was staring. Was that how women Squires looked? So small, and friendly-looking. And she smelled so nice. He was very glad she had let him look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said again, \"What\u0027s your name, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik came to life but stumbled badly in the attempt to shape a monosyllable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rik,\" he said. Then he thought, Why, that\u0027s not my name. He said, \"I think it\u0027s Rik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona, looking woebegone, tried to speak, but Samia held up a sharply restraining hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a Florinian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB,ik was positive here. \"No. I was on a ship. I came here from somewhere else.\" He could not bear to look away from Samia but he seemed to see the ship co-existing with her. A small and very friendly and homelike ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"It was on a ship that I came to Florina and before that I lived on a planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though the thought were forcing its way painfully through mental channels too small for it. Then Rik remembered and was delighted at the sound his voice made, a sound so long forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth! I come from Earth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia turned to the Captain. \"Where is this planet Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Racety smiled briefly. \"I never heard of it. Don\u0027t take the boy seriously, my Lady. A native lies the way he breathes. It comes naturally to him. He says whatever comes first into his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t talk like a native.\" She turned to Rik again. \"Where is Earth, Rik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-\" He put a shaking hand to his forehead. Then he said, \"It\u0027s in the Sirius Sector.\" The intonation of the statement made it half a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said to the Captain, \"There is a Sirius Sector, isn\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there is. I\u0027m amazed he has that right. Still, that doesn\u0027t make Earth any more reaL\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik said vehemently, \"But it is. I remember, I tell you. It\u0027s been so long since I remembered. I can\u0027t be wrong now. I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, gripping Valona\u0027s elbows and clawing at her sleeve. \"Lona, tell them I come from Earth. I do. I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona\u0027s eyes were wide with anxiety. \"We found him one day, Lady, and he had no mind at all. He couldn\u0027t dress himself or talk or walk. He was nothing. Ever since then he\u0027s been remembering little by little. So far everything he\u0027s remembered has been so.\" She cast a quick, fearful glance at the bored face of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain. \"He may really have come from Earth, Squire. No contradiction intended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last was a long-established conventional phrase that went with any statement that seemed in contradiction to a previous statement by a superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Racety grunted. \"He may have come from the center of Sark for all that story proves, my Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, but there\u0027s something queer about all this,\" insisted Samia, making up her mind flatly, woman-wise, on the side of romance. \"I\u0027m sure of it... What made him so helpless when you found him, girl? Had he been hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValona said nothing at first. Her eyes darted helplessly back and forth. First to Rik, whose fingers clutched at his hair, then to the Captain, who was smiling without humor, finally to Samia, who waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me, girl,\" said Samia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a hard decision for Valona to make, but no conceivable lie could substitute for the truth in this place and at this time. She said, \"A doctor once looked at him. He said m-my Rik was psycho-probed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psycho-probed!\" Samia felt a slight wash of repulsion well over her. She pushed her chair away. It squeaked against the metal floor. \"You mean he was psychotic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what that means, Lady,\" said Valona humbly. \"Not in the sense you\u0027re thinking of, my Lady,\" said the Captain almost simultaneously. \"Natives aren\u0027t psychotic. Their needs and desires are too simple. I\u0027ve never heard of a psychotic native in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s simple, my Lady. If we accept this fantastic story the girl tells, we can only conclude that the boy had been a criminal, which is a way of being psychotic, I suppose. If so, he must have been treated by one of those quacks who practice among the natives, been nearly killed and was then dumped in a deserted section to avoid detection and prosecution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it would have to be someone with a psycho-probe,\" protested Samia. \"Surely you wouldn\u0027t expect natives to be able to use them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not. But then you wouldn\u0027t expect an authorized medical man to use one so inexpertly. The fact that we arrive at a contradiction proves the story to be a lie throughout. If you will accept my suggestion, my Lady, you will leave these creatures to our handling. You see that it\u0027s useless to expect anything out of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia hesitated. \"Perhaps you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose and looked uncertainly at Rik. The Captain stepped behind her, lifted the little chair and folded it with a snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik jumped to his feet. \"Wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you please, my Lady,\" said the Captain, holding the door open for her. \"My men will quiet him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia stopped at the threshold. \"They won\u0027t hurt him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt if he\u0027ll make us go to extremes. He will be easy handling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady! Lady!\" Rik called. \"I can prove it. I\u0027m from Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia stood irresolute for a moment. \"Let\u0027s hear what he has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain said coldly, \"As you wish, my Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned, but not very far. She remained a step from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik was flushed. With the effort of remembering, his lips drew back into the caricature of a smile. He said, \"I remember Earth. It was radioactive. I remember the Forbidden Areas and the blue horizon at night. The soil glowed and nothing would grow in it. There were just a few spots men could live on. That\u0027s why I was a Spatio-analyst. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t mind staying in space. My world was a dead world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia shrugged. \"Come along, Captain. He\u0027s simply raving.\" But this time it was Captain Racety who stood there, open-mouthed. He muttered, \"A radioactive world!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"You mean there is such a thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He turned wondering eyes on her. \"Now where could he have picked that up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could a world be radioactive and inhabited?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there is one. And it is in the Sirius Sector. I don\u0027t remember its name. It might even be Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is Earth,\" said Rik, proudly and with confidence. \"It is the oldest planet of the Galaxy. It is the planet on which the whole human race originated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain said softly, \"That\u0027s so!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said, mind whirling, \"You mean the human race originated on this Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" said the Captain abstractedly. \"That\u0027s superstitiOn. It\u0027s just that that\u0027s how I came to hear about the radioactive planet. It claims to be Man\u0027s home planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know we were supposed to have a home planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose we started somewhere, my Lady, but I doubt that anyone can possibly know on what planet it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith sudden decision he walked toward Rik. \"What else do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost added \"boy,\" but held it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ship mostly,\" said Rik, \"and Spatio-analysis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia joined the Captain. They stood there, directly before Rik, and Samia felt the excitement returning. \"Then it\u0027s all true? But then how did he come to be psycho-probed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psycho-probed!\" said Captain Racety thoughtfully. \"Suppose we ask him. Here, you, native or outworider or whatever you are. How did you come to be psycho-probed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik looked doubtful. \"You all say that. Even Lona. But I don\u0027t know what the word means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you stop remembering, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\" He began again, desperately. \"I was on a ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that. Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said, \"It\u0027s no use barking, Captain. You\u0027ll drive out what few wits are left him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik was entirely absorbed in wrenching at the dimness within his mind. The effort left no room for any emotion. It was to his own astonishment that he said, \"I\u0027m not afraid of him, Lady. I\u0027m trying to remember. There was danger. I\u0027m sure of that. Great danger to Florina, but I can\u0027t remember the details about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danger to the whole planet?\" Samia cast a swift glance at the Captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It was in the currents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What currents?\" asked the Captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The currents of space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain spread his hands and let them drop. \"This is madness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Let him go on.\" The tide of belief had shifted to Samia again. Her lips were parted, her dark eyes gleamed and little dimples between cheek and chin made their appearance as she smiled. \"What are the currents of space?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The different elements,\" said Rik vaguely. He had explained that before. He didn\u0027t want to go through that again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on rapidly, nearly incoherently, speaking as the thoughts came to him, driven by them. \"I sent a message to the local office on Sark. I remember that very clearly. I had to be careful. It was a danger that went beyond Florina. Yes. Beyond Florina. It was as wide as the Milky Way. It had to be handled carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to have lost all real contact with those who listened to him, to be living in a world of the past before which a curtain was tearing away in places. Valona placed a soothing hand upon his shoulder and said, \"Don\u0027t!\" but he was unresponsive even to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow,\" he went on breathlessly, \"my message was intercepted by some official on Sark. It was a mistake. I don\u0027t know how it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"I\u0027m sure I sent it to the local office on the Bureau\u0027s own wave length. Do you suppose the sub-ether could have been tapped?\" He did not even wonder that the word \"sub-ether\" came so easily to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might have been waiting for an answer, but his eyes were still unseeing. \"Anyway, when I landed on Sark they were waiting for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain a pause, this time long and meditative. The Captain did nothing to break it; he seemed to be meditating himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia, however, said, \"Who was waiting for you? Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRik said, \"I-I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t remember. It wasn\u0027t the office. It was someone of Sark. I remember speaking to him. He knew about the danger. He spoke of it. I\u0027m sure he spoke of it. We sat at a table together. I remember the table. He sat opposite me. It\u0027s as clear as space. We spoke for quite a while. It seems to me I wasn\u0027t anxious to give details. I\u0027m sure of that. I would have had to speak to the office first. And then he...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" prompted Samia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did something. He- No, nothing more will come. Nothing will come!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed the words and then there was silence, a silence that was anticlimactically broken by the prosaic buzz of the Captain\u0027s wrist communo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answering voice was reedy and precisely respectful. \"A message to the Captain from Sark. It is requested that he accept it personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. I will be at the sub-etherics presently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Samia. \"My Lady, may I suggest that it is, in any case, dinnertime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that the girl was about to protest her lack of appetite, to urge him to leave and not to bother about her. He continued, more diplomatically, \"It is also time to feed these creatures. They are probably tired and hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia could say nothing against that. \"I must see them again, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain bowed silently. It might have been acquiescence. It might not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia of Fife was thrilled. Her studies of Florina satisfied a certain aspiration to intellect within her, but the Mysterious Case of the Psycho-probed Earthman (she thought of the matter in capitals) appealed to something much more primitive and much more demanding. It roused the sheer animal curiosity in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mystery!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three points that fascinated her. Among these was not the perhaps reasonable question (under the circumstances) of whether the man\u0027s story was a delusion or a deliberate lie, rather than the truth. To believe it anything other than truth would spoil the mystery and Samia could not allow that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three points were therefore these. (i) What was the danger that threatened Florina, or, rather, the entire Galaxy? (z)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was the person who had psycho-probed the Earthman? (~)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had the person used the psycho-probe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was determined to sift the matter to her own thorough satisfaction. No one is so modest as not to believe himself a competent amateur sleuth, and Samia was far from modest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon after dinner as she could politely manage, she hurried down to the brig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said to the guard, \"Open the door!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sailor remained perfectly erect, staring blankly and respectfully ahead. He said, \"If Your Ladyship pleases, the door is not to be opened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia gasped. \"How dare you say so? If you do not open the door instantly, the Captain shall be informed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Your Ladyship pleases, the door is not to be opened. That is by the strict order of the Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stormed up the levels once more, bursting into the Captain\u0027s stateroom like a tornado compressed into sixty inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ordered the Earthman and the native woman to be kept from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe, my Lady, it was agreed that you were to interview them only in my presence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before dinner, yes. But you saw they were harmless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw that they seemed harmless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia simmered. \"In that case I order you to come with me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot, my Lady. The situation has changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must be questioned by the proper authorities on Sark and until then I think they should be left alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia\u0027s lower jaw dropped, but she rescued it from its undignified position almost immediately. \"Surely you are not going to deliver them to the Bureau of Florinian Affairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" temporized the Captain, \"that was certainly the original intention. They have left their village without permission. In fact they have left their planet without permission. In addition, they have taken secret passage on a Sarkite vessel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last was a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In any case, you knew all their crimes before our last interview.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was only at the interview that I heard what the socalled Earthman had to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So-called. You said yourself that the planet Earth existed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said it might exist. But, my Lady, may I be so bold as to ask what you would like to see done with these people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Earthman\u0027s story should be investigated. He speaks of a danger to Florina and of someone on Sark who has deliberately attempted to keep knowledge of that danger from the proper authorities. I think it is even a case for my father. In fact I would take him to my father, when the proper time came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain said, \"The cleverness of it all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you being sarcastic, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain flushed. \"Your pardon, my Lady. I was referring to our prisoners. May I be allowed to speak at some length?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you mean by \u0027some length,\" she retorted angrily, \"but I suppose you may begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. In the first place, my Lady, I hope you will not minimize the importance of the disturbances on Florina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What disturbances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot have forgotten the incident in the library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A patroller killed! Really, Captain!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a second patroller killed this morning, my Lady, and a native as well. It is not very usual for natives to kill patrollers and here is one who has done it twice, and yet remains uncaught. Is he a lone hand? Is it an accident? Or is it all part of a carefully laid scheme?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently you believe the last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. The murdering native had two accomplices. Their description is rather like that of our two stowaways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never said so!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not wish to alarm Your Ladyship. You\u0027ll remember, however, that I told you repeatedly that they could be dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very welL What follows from all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if the murders on Florina were simply side shows intended to distract the attention of the patroller squadrons while these two sneaked aboard our ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds so silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it? Why are they running away from Florina? We haven\u0027t asked them. Let us suppose they are running away from the patrollers since that is certainly the most reasonable assump tion. Would they be running to Sark of all places? And on a ship that carries Your Ladyship? And then he claims to be a Spatioanalyst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia frowned. \"What of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year ago a Spatio-analyst was reported missing. The story was never given wide publicity. I knew, of course, because my ship was one of those that searched near space for signs of his ship. Whoever is backing these Florinian disorders has undoubtedly seized on that fact, and just knowing that the matter of the missing Spatio-analyst is known to them shows what a tight and unexpectedly efficient organization they have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be that the Earthman and the missing Spatio-analyst have no connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No real connection, my Lady, undoubtedly. But to expect no connection at all is to expect too much of coincidence. It is an impostor we are dealing with. That is why he claims to have been psycho-probed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can we prove he isn\u0027t a Spatio-analyst? He knows no details of the planet Earth beyond the bare fact that it is radioactive. He cannot pilot a ship. He knows nothing of Spatioanalysis. And he covers up by insisting he was psycho-probed. Do you see, my Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia could make no direct answer. \"But to what purpose?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that you might do exactly what you said you intended to do, my Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Investigate the mystery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my Lady. Take the man to your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still see no point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are several possibilities. At the best, he could be a spy upon your father, either for Florina or possibly for Trantor. I imagine old Abel of Trantor would certainly come forward to identify him as an Earthman, if for no other reason than to embarrass Sark by demanding the truth concerning this fictitious psycho-probing. At the worst, he will be your father\u0027s assassin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is ridiculous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, my Lady. But if so, the Department of Security is also ridiculous. You will recall that just before dinner I was called away to receive a message from Sark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027his is it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia received the thin translucent foil with its red lettering. It said: \"Two Floriians are reported to have taken secret, illegal passage on your ship. Secure them immediately. One of them may claim to be a Spatio-analyst and not a Florinian native. You are to take no action in this matter. You will be held strictly responsible for the safety of these people. They are to be held for delivery to Depsec. Extreme secrecy. Extreme urgency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia felt stunned. \"Depsec,\" she said. \"The Department of Security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extreme secrecy,\" said the Captain. \"I stretch a point to tell you this, but you have left me no choice, my Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"What will they do to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot say for certain,\" said the Captain. \"Certainly a suspected spy and assassin cannot expect gentle treatment. Probably his pretense will become partly a reality and he will learn what a psycho-probe is really like.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-currents-of-space-galactic-empire-2/page-12.html","bookId":1725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:48 AM"}
