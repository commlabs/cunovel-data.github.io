{"id":96254,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eA few days later, Stormy was set to arrive in Dullsville. I was so excited to meet her, I skipped dinner and waited for the sun to set outside the Mansion. I remembered how anxious I had been to meet Alexander\u0027s parents. I\u0027d imagined what they were like and worried what kind of impression I\u0027d make. This time, I wasn\u0027t as nervous, but I was hoping Alexander\u0027s sister and I would get along smoothly. When the door finally opened, I greeted Alexander with a huge kiss. I was pacing around the Mansion, the yummy smell of Jameson\u0027s dinner in the warmer wafting throughout, while Alexander lay on the antique sofa, flipping through a modern art magazine as we waited for Jameson\u0027s Mercedes to pull in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I hear a car,\" I said, running to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the tenth time you\u0027ve said that,\" he said, not looking up from the mag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s them this time,\" I said, happily twisting the doorknob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not the Mercedes,\" Alexander called as I opened the door, as if he knew with his vampire sixth sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointed, I thought it best to wait it out with Alexander. And why not? We had so little alone-time anymore that I might as well take advantage of it. I snuggled up to him on the sofa and was leaning my head on his chest when I heard a car on the street. The sound got louder with each passing moment, and bright lights shined on the Mansion. I knew this had to be Jameson\u0027s ride. We both sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poked my head against the window and peered out into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw two headlights and a black car illuminated from the streetlight. \"It\u0027s them! It\u0027s Jameson\u0027s car.\" Alexander couldn\u0027t hide his enthusiasm from me as he, too, beamed. We headed to the door, and after he opened it I followed him outside to the parked car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson said good evening to us as he slowly came around the back of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did my best to catch a glimpse of Stormy, but all I could see was dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited with bated breath to see Alexander\u0027s little sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson politely opened her door d, \"and out stepped Stormy Sterling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy was rail thin and stood about five feet two. She had straight bangs and shoulder-length jet-black hair. Her nails were bitten and chipped; charcoal-colored nail polish remained. Midnight-colored lipstick stained her small lips. She had rubber bracelets and a black-and-white headband. Tiny silver studs and hoops ran up the sides of her tiny earlobes. Her shirt was lacy, and her tights were ripped in all the trendy and cool places. She wore mini-monster boots and black fingerless lace gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was everything I dreamed she\u0027d be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander!\" she called in a sweet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy raced over to him, and he enveloped her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s great to see you!\" she squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s great to see you, too!\" It was obvious how much he had missed his sister as he continued to hug her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey eventually let go. Stormy giggled. \"We have full reign without parents! We are going to have the time of our lives!\" I hung back until she noticed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander swooped in with gentlemanly introductions. \"This is Raven. Raven, this is my sister, Athena,\" he said. \"But her friends call her Stormy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a pleasure to meet you.\" She extended her hand. Stormy was precious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so excited you\u0027re here!\" I gushed, just like I hoped I wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to run up and hug Stormy - the sister I\u0027d always wanted. Only I knew when I was her age - and even now - how awkward it was when an older person acted all gooey on me when we had barely even been introduced. It always felt fake, though in this case it would have been genuine. Instead of squeezing her to bits, I kept my distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled a polite smile, exposing white plastic braces adorned with purple and black rubber bands, with small vampire fangs peeking out below them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then her smile soured. \"Oh no! I forgot Phantom!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned to the car, and Jameson held in his stick-pin arms a ghost-white cat with pink eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jameson! Thank you!\" Stormy rushed over and held her cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are quite welcome, Miss Athena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s cute,\" I whispered to Alexander. \"Just like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll love it here, Phantom,\" she cooed to her cat. \"Just like I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander noticed Jameson grabbing Stormy\u0027s suitcase and backpack from the trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get that, Jameson,\" Alexander offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, but no need,\" the Creepy Man said. \"You greet your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go inside,\" Alexander said. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awesome! I can\u0027t wait for a smoothie with cherries and a purple sword!\" Stormy exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Miss Athena,\" the Creepy Man said with a toothy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy raced into the Mansion. \"Here I am!\" she declared to the empty foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander beamed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is so awesome,\" she continued to Alexander. \"I\u0027m going to have so much fun here with you!\" He tousled her hair like only a big brother could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do remember - it\u0027s all the same,\" she said, smoothing out her hair. \"This isn\u0027t fair!\" she exclaimed. \"You get full reign of this place without Mother and Father looking over your shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson placed her bags by the staircase. \"Dinner won\u0027t be long. Then I\u0027ll unpack your things, Miss Athena, as you settle in.\" He creeped slowly toward the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which room is mine?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to guess,\" Alexander said. \"But I think you\u0027ll know it when you see it. Raven helped me decorate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did?\" Her eyes squinted, and her voice couldn\u0027t hide her skepticism. I knew there was a chance she\u0027d resent me decorating parts of the Mansion, and here it was before me. She pushed a smile out as hard as she could. \"That was very kind of you,\" she said, overly polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander put his arm around her bony shoulder as the two walked up the staircase. I knew it was important to let the two siblings have their time together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander put his arm around her bony shoulder as the two walked up the staircase. I knew it was important to let the two siblings have their time together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can help Jameson,\" I said from the bottom of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to come up, too,\" Alexander directed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was anxious when we reached the top of the stairs. My heart thrummed the way it Ced h\u003d\"2 might if I was throwing a surprise party and hoping that the recipient was indeed surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the looks of Stormy\u0027s style, I thought maybe she\u0027d like how I decorated her room, but there was a huge chance I could have missed the mark on her taste and she\u0027d see the room as a big disaster. I held my breath as Alexander lit several candles, illuminating her room. Though the vampires could see in the dark, the soft light helped us all see the room\u0027s interior even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused and glanced around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This ... is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" Alexander asked, waiting for her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gorgeous! It\u0027s just fabulous!\" she exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Phantom examined her new surroundings by jumping on the chaise longue and sniffing at the stuffed animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed a sigh of relief, and it appeared that Alexander had been anxious, too, as his sigh was audible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raced over to the chaise longue, hopped on it, and hugged a few of the pillows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this Hello Batty plush!\" she said, holding it up. \"Do I get to keep it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything is yours,\" Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can put your coffin right here,\" Alexander said, pointing to the only empty area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words sent goose bumps over my flesh. A coffin. For a girl to sleep in. It was so awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy buzzed around the room, touching everything she saw. \"I love these candles!\" she said, sniffing the lavender scent. \"And these picture frames - with your paintings of us, Alexander! These look exactly like Mother and Father. And these curtains! They are so long and luscious!\" She draped them over herself as if they were a ball gown. \"How do I look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a movie star!\" Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you did all this for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, actually,\" he said, \"Raven did. You know that I don\u0027t have a clue about buying frilly pillows,\" Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought you did it with her,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Alexander put everything together,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Raven picked out everything and designed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" she asked. \"How did you know what I liked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Raven found everything,\" Alexander said proudly. \"She did a great job, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She nodded enthusiastically. Then she asked, \"Did Luna help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna? There was that name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Alexander said. \"Why would Luna help? This was all Raven. You have her to thank for your room.\" Alexander genuinely meant that the work I\u0027d done was a sincere gesture from me to Stormy, but I was afraid she\u0027d be upset that someone other than her own family - a stranger to her - had decorated her room. I couldn\u0027t blame her if those were her true feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you so much, Raven. I love it!\" she said, twisting her jet-black locks. It was as if she thought about hugging me but didn\u0027t know what to do. Instead, she flashed me a smile and hopped again on the chaise longue with Phantom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to thank me,\" I said. \"I had a great time doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson came into the room and placed Stormy\u0027s luggage by the dresser. \"I\u0027ll bring her coffin up, too.\" The Creepy Man was frail, and I couldn\u0027t imagine him bringing a casket up the Mansion staircase or even assembling one on his own. Fortunately, neither could Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Alexander said. \"I\u0027ll get that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Dinner will be ready in a few moments,\" the butler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy hopped off the chaise longue and straightened her skirt. Jameson left, and Alexander and I watched as Stormy surveyed all the trinkets I\u0027d placed on her bookshelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned slightly, and I could tell by her expression that she was really pleased with her new digs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where is Raven\u0027s room?\" she asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was taken aback by her direct question and chuckled nervously. \"At her house,\" Alexander replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t live here, too?\" she asked me as if she was expecting I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I live with my family. And they are not as exciting as yours. Believe me.\" Stormy seemed slightly relieved knowing I hadn\u0027t taken physical custody of the Mansion and she had power over her rightful territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be hungry,\" Alexander said. \"Let\u0027s hit the kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander blew out the candles, and we followed Stormy out of her room until she paused at the top of the stairs and turned to look at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you two getting married?\" she suddenly blurted out like a typical younger sibling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, and Alexander cracked a crooked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy and I waited to hear Alexander\u0027s response. I wasn\u0027t sure how she wanted him to respond, but I knew how I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander put his hand on his sister\u0027s shoulder and guided her down the staircase. \"Jameson!\" he called. \"We\u0027re coming down to dinner!\" I think we were both disappointed not to get an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat down to eat in the formal dining room, which was dressed with gleaming silver, fine china, and linen napkins. Several candelabras lit the room, and the red candle wax dripped like a bleeding wound. Alexander pulled out Stormy\u0027s chair, seating her to the left of him, and I followed suit at his right. Stormy and I faced each other across the table, with Alexander in the middle at the head of the table. Stormy, so cool and stylish in her lacy black fingerless gloves, placed her linen napkin gingerly on her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson pushed the dining cart in from the kitchen and served us a nice dinner of rare filets (medium well for me), twice-baked potatoes, and peas. Stormy had a blood-filled glass goblet garnished with a cherry and a purple sword, while Alexander also had a blood-filled goblet. Mine was filled with boring old soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Stormy lowered her goblet after her first sip, red liquid dotted the corners of her lips. Alexander gestured to her, and she rolled her eyes at him. When she wiped it off, the dark liquid smeared the light napkin. I was shocked. I\u0027d seen wine-stained napkins before, but this was the first time I\u0027d seen a bloodstained one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what have you been up to?\" Alexander asked as he cut his juicy steak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing much,\" she said. \"Home isn\u0027t the same without you there.\" Stormy cut her steak into tiny little pieces. She savored each bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" Alexander challenged. \"You are always busy with something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her chocolate-brown eyes. \"Well, you\u0027ve been gone a long time. How can I tell you everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Alexander took a bite of his meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were only supposed to be gone until the Maxwell feud was over,\" she said, pushing her peas around with her fork. \"And it is. Once you took Valentine back to Jagger, it was over. But you didn\u0027t come home. You stayed here.\" She didn\u0027t look at me. She didn\u0027t have to. I could feel the tension from the younger Sterling as if she blamed me for his absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said. \"But I have a life here now, too. So what is so different without me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The house is so big. I have no one to talk to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t talk all the time,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But it was nice having you there. That\u0027s where you live, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I live here. For now. Mom and Dad told you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But it\u0027s so far away. You get to have all the fun. It\u0027s not fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you have fun, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not. Not like you. You get to meet a lot of people. You get to do what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m eighteen,\" he said. \"When I was twelve, I didn\u0027t get to do everything that I wanted. Besides, I could be going to college soon, anyway. You have to get used to my being away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is different,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know why....\" she hinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should talk about this later? You just got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it best to divert the conversation. \"Are you homeschooled like Alexander?\" I asked Stormy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like that?\" I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" she said. I was surprised she wasn\u0027t more excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m jealous of that. I think it would be so cool. Hanging out at home. Getting to watch TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get to watch TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not,\" Alexander said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to you,\" she said. \"You are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I call this town Dullsville,\" I said, \"and I say that for a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon. You have a great time,\" Alexander said. \"You study, you travel. You have a lot of friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not!\" she said. \"I don\u0027t even have a boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you have plenty of time for that.\" Alexander was emphatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m twelve! I get just as thirsty as you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you don\u0027t have friends,\" I said. \"I bet you have tons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, a few. But I don\u0027t have a boyfriend, and the only guy I get to hang out with is Valentine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valentine Maxwell?\" I asked, referring to the Maxwell twins\u0027 younger sibling. He was my brother Billy\u0027s age. Billy, his friend Henry, and Valentine had hung out together when Valentine came to Dullsville in search of his older siblings. Instead he found a friendly clique with Billy and Henry and tried to become blood brothers with them. But soon Valentine grew thirsty, and without another to feed on or a bottled-blood-filled cellar like the Mansion\u0027s, Valentine grew weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander returned Valentine to a thankful Jagger in Hipsterville, and the feud with the Maxwells was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh, do you like him?\" I pried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is?\" Alexander asked, surprised. \"I\u0027ve never heard you talk about him that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I want to meet new guys. And Mother and Father keep me studying too much of the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, your education is very important,\" Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh,\" she said. \"You would say that. You all want me locked up forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not locked up,\" he said. \"Quit being so dramatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am; you don\u0027t even know. You don\u0027t mind painting in your room for hours. But I want to be out and seeing the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you are here, now,\" he said. \"This is getting out into the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face at her brother. \"I know. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you like to do for fun?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... I read and write poems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And try to sneak out of the house?\" Alexander teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just sometimes,\" she said with an impish smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do that, too,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" She gazed at me skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I really sneak in more places than I sneak out of. In fact, that\u0027s the first time I saw Alexander face-to-face. Right there - \" I said, pointing to the bottom of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander cleared his throat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no secret,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secret?\" she asked eagerly. \"Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward. \"I snuck into the Mansion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" Again she was skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I answered proudly. \"And it wasn\u0027t the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she shouldn\u0027t hear all this,\" Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, tell me.\" Stormy was keen to hear more. \"I must know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to sneak in here when I was younger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want to sneak in?\" she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to see what was on the inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny, I\u0027ve always wanted to see what is on the outside,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we will get to that tomorrow,\" Alexander said as we finished our desserts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t long before Alexander was preparing to take me home. I was grabbing my coat in the foyer when I overheard the two siblings talking in the kitchen. I knew I should let the two of them talk privately, but I couldn\u0027t help myself. It wasn\u0027t like me not to eavesdrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew I should let the two of them talk privately, but I couldn\u0027t help myself. It wasn\u0027t like me not to eavesdrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tiptoed over to the kitchen\u0027s entryway and hung outside of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what Can hear mor are we going to do here?\" I heard Stormy ask. \"I want to see the town. And Luna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see her sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But when? I\u0027ve missed her so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you think Raven\u0027s cool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she is very pretty. Mother and Father raved about her when they came home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did?\" His voice was bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All they talked about for a week straight was Raven.\" Her voice grew dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I know you guys will be fast friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why haven\u0027t you come home?\" Stormy asked softly. \"Is it because of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I had to leave. For the family. There was too much turmoil if I stayed. Why would it be because of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sure if you were mad at me - from the night of the covenant ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t be mad at you. It was my decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was so angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understood. Everyone was upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s been a year. You weren\u0027t supposed to stay this long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you like Raven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why ... why didn\u0027t you turn Luna? She\u0027s beautiful and so much fun! All you had to do was turn her. Then we all could be together in Romania. And she could have been a vampire - a Sterling vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wasn\u0027t the right girl for me. I\u0027m sorry to have disappointed you. But Luna is doing fine. She doesn\u0027t need me to get along in this world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now that Luna is a vampire, why don\u0027t you like her?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stormy... I wasn\u0027t ... it just wasn\u0027t right. You\u0027ll understand when you\u0027re older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand now. You don\u0027t think I know about love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you do ... well, you\u0027ll know that you need to wait for the one you really love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you didn\u0027t love Luna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t hear him answer. I figured he was shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet again. I was hoping he was nodding this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have to talk about all this tonight,\" Alexander finally said, \"do we?\" Just then I stepped back into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy looked at me as if she wondered how much I\u0027d heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were just catching up a bit,\" Alexander said. \"I kind of left home in a hurry. Not the best situation. But now we\u0027re together - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. Stormy flashed a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to take Raven home,\" he said to his sibling. \"Maybe you can take a catnap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s only midnight,\" she whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know - but you\u0027ve traveled quite a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a child,\" she said, just as I probably would have in her situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd to leave and have to be the one going to bed while a twelve-year-old girl got to stay awake until sunrise. Being a mortal had its drawbacks. \"It was nice to finally meet you, Stormy,\" I said. \"I hope to see you again soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it was lovely meeting you, Raven,\" she said with a sweet grin. I was hoping for a hug, but it didn\u0027t happen. She politely offered her hand instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gently shook it, and she raced up the grand staircase, just like I had a hundred times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt kind of lonely, knowing that I had to go home while the siblings got to hang out together. But this was really about Alexander and not me, and I took comfort in knowing that his loneliness, living in the Mansion with just Jameson for company, was minimized again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems really sweet,\" I said when Alexander and I had settled into the Mercedes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you like her,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s not to like?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you call her Stormy?\" I asked when we drove down the long and winding drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has her moments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? She seems very polite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is. But she can be very vocal and dramatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027d say that,\" he said with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remembered the private chat that I\u0027d overheard. \"I don\u0027t want her to resent me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she? She just likes to be the center of attention, that\u0027s all. She always has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean that you didn\u0027t return to Romania. She might think that you are still here because of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I am.\" Alexander sported a reassuring smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s your decision,\" I said. \"She needs to know that. Otherwise she\u0027ll just blame me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know so. I just wanted you to know, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander paused for a moment, as if he was giving my words real thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe sometime this week you two can spend some girl-time together,\" he said. \"Then she\u0027ll know exactly why I fell in love with you, too.\" d \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-5.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
