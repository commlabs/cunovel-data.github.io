{"id":32236,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION","content":"THE table in the Fenton dining-room had been arranged to form a perfect circle with the addition of several table leaves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Above the table were the flags of the Eagle’s Wing Troop and the American flag.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stacked in a corner of the room were the banners made of silver cloth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The arm chair was empty, but the eight others were occupied by the Girl Scouts in their regulation uniforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joan Peters, the new Patrol Leader, in the absence of the Captain, was presiding.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was a tall, slender girl with light-brown hair and eyes of almost the same shade. Her features were regular and delicately cut. She possessed a poise of manner and a seriousness unusual in so young a person. Joan was an only child and her mother a semi-invalid. Her father, an inventor, had made no practical success with any of his inventions, so that Joan was forced through circumstances to become the practical member of her family.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 118 She was leaning forward now over the round table, her eyes traveling slowly from one face to the other, faces that either returned her gaze or revealed downcast eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the old room there was a momentary silence in spite of the presence of so many girls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I agree with Tory. It is absolutely necessary that we do something right away,” Joan remarked slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louise Miller appeared impatient.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, but what? I know it has been good for all our souls to confess that we have fallen into the slough of despond. Assuredly we are upon the downward grade! I don’t know how to express it! Having made the confession, what is to happen next? I have realized ever since Christmas that I was not living up to our Girl Scout principles, as I tried so hard to in the beginning. At first we had the excitement of organizing and of struggling to earn our first merit badges, of ceasing to be mere tenderfeet. Then followed our wonderful summer in Beechwood Forest! Never have I been so happy anywhere on earth! I am sure my whole life will be influenced by it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “When I came back home in the early fall I remember making the noblest resolutions.119 I was going to work harder at school, not in the subjects I care for most, but in those that have never interested me. I was going to be more helpful at home. My family would scarcely believe that I acquired a badge for cooking over a camp fire last summer. I intended to forget that I am more thrilled by birds and insects and trees and stones than by making beds and dusting the parlor and sewing on buttons. In truth, I really gave such a good imitation of doing what I should, that my family, who were not enthusiastic about the Girl Scouts at first, were beginning to be impressed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Just before Christmas time I discovered myself slipping into my old indifference and awkwardness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mother declares I have become impossible now. So what shall I do? We might take up each individual case one at a time. I am sure I am the most hopeless of our Troop, so begin with me. I never have felt I had the same right the rest of you have to membership.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no mistaking the fact that Louise was deeply in earnest. She possessed little self-esteem, scarcely a sufficient amount. Her own lack of beauty and charm of manner, her slow, oftentimes clumsy movements,120 her inability to speak or think quickly, had always given her the consciousness that she was less attractive than other girls. And unfortunately for Louise, her own mother in a measure agreed with this opinion. She herself was pretty, graceful and fond of society.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One person had struggled to influence Louise’s unfortunate estimate of herself, her closest friend, Dorothy McClain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Having finished her speech, Louise was leaning over, resting her head upon her hand, appearing more discouraged than the other girls considered necessary under the circumstances.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louise’s features were large, her complexion pallid; she had only two claims to beauty, her curious light-gray eyes and copper-red hair. Ordinarily she wore unsuitable clothes, so that she looked better in her Scout uniform than in other costumes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nonsense, Ouida, we are not going at things in any such spirit!” Dorothy remarked with the good sense and directness that distinguished her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Teresa Peterson looked relieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She and Louise were not congenial; it was impossible they should be with such totally different temperaments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 121 Teresa was exceptionally pretty and pleasure loving. She could see nothing to admire in Louise’s appearance or in her serious disposition. Her philosophy of life, although Teresa would never have appreciated that she possessed a philosophy, and would have disliked the name, was never to trouble so long as it was possible to enjoy oneself. She had pretty, soft manners and was gentle and affectionate, save when any one opposed a strong desire on her part.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If the Girl Scouts realized that Teresa was unlike the rest of them, they perhaps expected less of her. Several of the older girls, particularly Joan Peters, had a special affection for Teresa and a wish to shelter her from criticism or difficulty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I cannot see why it is our fault that we have been bored and cross since Christmas,” she now remarked plaintively. “How can we expect anything else after the lovely times we had then, the dances and sleigh rides and skating party and the queer Christmas Eve entertainment at Miss Frean’s when we were made Knights of something or other and recited all sorts of funny poetry?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps the laughter following Teresa’s speech was better for the group of Girl Scouts than Louise’s introspection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 122 “I don’t wonder you say ‘Knights of something or other’,” Tory added. “When I saw Kara in New York she was not in the least enthusiastic over our Knighthood. I quoted Mrs. Browning’s poem: ‘The world’s male chivalry has vanished quite, but women are knight-errants to the last.’ Kara thought the idea too fanciful, as she does most of my cherished suggestions. I told her we simply wished to have an original entertainment and to hold our indoor Scout meetings this winter about a Round Table. Nevertheless, I do remember that I was chosen to represent Sir Galahad, the Knight who went in quest of the Holy Grail. Because his life was purer than any other of the Knights he was allowed to behold the Grail.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The speaker lowered her voice and her eyelids drooped over her dark eyes, as if she were ashamed to go on with what she was struggling to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I might as well confess I have wondered what the Quest of the Holy Grail may mean in one’s ordinary, everyday life? I suppose it is not so unlike what we are told to do in our Girl Scout work, do good to others and follow the best that is in each of us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl’s glance traveled from the flags123 above the round table to the pile of banners in the far corner of the old room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, Tory, what is it that you wish to tell us? You have something to propose. Somehow we always expect you to inspire us when we need a new incentive,” Margaret Hale said encouragingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still the other girl hesitated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t believe I ought to suggest anything. I had not an idea to propose when we started our Round Table discussion. I was in such a bad humor before you girls arrived, I though everybody and everything responsible except me. Then Dorothy and I fell to talking and discovered we were in the same state of mind, afterwards Louise, and then one by one each member of our Patrol. It was funny! Still, I cannot help being sorry. Not one of our knightly banners is emblazoned with any sign of a service we have rendered to any human being since Christmas. Worse, I for one am failing always to do the daily good turn I promised in our Girl Scout pledge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Go on, Tory, we have agreed we are in the same state of mind and have been making the same mistakes,” Edith Linder protested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other girl nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Very well. Please remember that whether124 you agree with me or not, for once in my life I intend to be simple and practical in my suggestion. And I want you to write and tell Kara.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “As we have been sitting here this afternoon the same idea has occurred to each one of us. Our trouble is that we have been thinking of ourselves. The only cure is to think of some one else. I have not Kara any longer to care for and that makes a big difference with me. But there must be some one else in Westhaven. So I propose that this week each one of us finds some one who is ill and needing help of some character. It does not matter whether the person is a member of our own family or a stranger, rich or poor, young or old, we must manage to make them more comfortable. Then at our next Scout meeting we can report to one another. Don’t you think this may be worth while? I am not pretending to be very original this afternoon.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is not important always to be original, Tory,” Margaret Hale declared, in a voice and manner that always influenced her companions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I propose that we vote on your suggestion. It might be more inspiring if we try to find people who are especially in need of help.125 If they are willing, we could tell of what they have suffered. This might prove as interesting and exciting as reading thrilling stories.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the vote that followed no voice dissented.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only Teresa sighed and exclaimed:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I believe I shall choose Miss Mason! She is our Scout Captain and sent word to Tory that she was too ill to be with us this afternoon. Of course she only has a bad cold, but she may grow worse. Besides, I dearly love going to her house and sitting in her pretty room. I wish I were grown and our house not so filled with ugly things. Living in Miss Mason’s room, curled up on her blue couch with the yellow and blue cushions, would give me a lovely disposition,” Teresa concluded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tory shook her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good gracious, Teresa dear, I am afraid if our Troop Captain continues ill she will suffer from too much attention! I don’t think you really have grasped our idea. But for goodness’ sake let us stop being so serious! If we are through with our Scout meeting, suppose you come and help me bring in tea, Teresa.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1686/49661.html","bookId":1169,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:59:55 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:59:55 AM"}
