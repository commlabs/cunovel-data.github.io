She still hadn\u0027t recovered from the shocks of tonight, and her face was strained as she stared at Faye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there was worse to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that it was finally going to happen, Cassie felt a curious sense of freedom. No more hiding, no more lying and evading. The nightmare was here at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I should have told you before, but I didn\u0027t want to upset you,\" Faye was saying. Her eyes burned golden with a savage inner fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam, who wasn\u0027t stupid, glanced from Cassie to Faye and obviously came to a quick, if shattering, conclusion. He swiftly cupped a hand under Diana\u0027s elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever it is can wait,\" he said. \"Cassie ought to go and see her mother, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it can\u0027t wait, Adam Conant,\" Faye interrupted. \"It\u0027s time Diana found out what sort of people she has around her.\" Faye whirled to face Diana again, her pale skin glowing with strange elation against the midnight-dark mane of her hair. \"The ones you\u0027ve chosen,\" she said to her cousin. \"Your dearest friend - and him. The incorruptible Sir Adam. Do you want to know the reason you couldn\u0027t make it as leader? Do you want to know how naive you really are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was gathering close now, staring. Cassie could see varying degrees of bewilderment and suspicion in their expressions. The full moon shining from the west was so bright that it cast shadows, and it illuminated every detail of the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked at each of them: tough Deborah, beautiful Suzan with her perfect face marred by a puzzled frown, cool Melanie, and graceful, elfin Laurel. She looked at Chris and Doug Henderson, the wild twins, who were standing by the slinking figure of Sean, and at icily handsome Nick behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she looked at Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still holding Diana\u0027s arm, but his proud, arresting face was tense and alert. His eyes met Cassie\u0027s and something like understanding flashed between them, and then Cassie looked away, ashamed. She had no right to lean on Adam\u0027s strength. She was about to be exposed for what she was in front of the entire Circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kept hoping they would do the decent thing and control themselves,\" Faye said. \"For their own sake, if not yours. But, obviously - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye, what are you talking about?\" Diana interrupted, her patience splintering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, about Cassie and Adam, of course,\" Faye said, slowly opening her golden eyes wide. \"About how they\u0027ve been fooling around behind your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words fell like stones into a tranquil pool. There was a long moment of utter silence, then Doug Henderson threw back his head and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, an\u0027 my mom\u0027s a topless dancer,\" he jeered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Mother Teresa\u0027s really Catwoman,\" said Chris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Faye,\" Laurel said sharply. \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 don\u0027t blame you for not believing me,\" she said. \"I was shocked too. But you see, it all started before Cassie came to New Salem. It started when she met Adam down on Cape Cod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence this time had a different quality. Cassie saw Laurel look quickly at Melanie. Everyone knew that Cassie had spent several weeks on the Cape last summer. And everyone knew that Adam had been down in that area too, looking for the Master Tools. Cassie saw the dawning of startled understanding on the faces around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all started on the beach there,\" Faye went on. She was obviously enjoying herself, as she always enjoyed being the center of attention. She looked sexy and commanding as she wet her lips and spoke throatily, addressing the entire group although her words were meant for Diana. \"It was love at first sight, I guess -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or at least they couldn\u0027t keep their hands off each other. When Cassie came up here she even wrote a poem about it. Now how did that go?\" Faye tilted her head to one side and recited:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Each night I lie and dream about the one Who kissed me and awakened my desire I spent a single hour with him alone And since that hour, my days are laced with fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right; that was her poem,\" Suzan said. \"1 remember. We had her in the old science building and she didn\u0027t want us to read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah was nodding, her petite face twisted in a scowl. \"I remember too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may also remember how strange they both acted at Cassie\u0027s initiation,\" Faye said. \"And how Raj seemed to take to Cassie so quickly, always jumping up on her and licking her and all. Well, it\u0027s very simple really - it\u0027s because they\u0027d known each other before. They didn\u0027t want any of us to know that, of course. They tried to hide it. But eventually they got caught. It was the night we first used the crystal skull in Diana\u0027s garage - Adam was taking Cassie home, I guess. I wonder how that got arranged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was the turn of Laurel and Melanie to look startled. Clearly they remembered the night of the first skull ceremony, when Diana had asked Adam to walk Cassie home, and Adam, after a brief hesitation, had agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They thought they were alone on the bluff - but somebody was watching. Two little somebodies, two little friends of mine . . .\" Lazily, Faye worked her fingers, with their long, scarlet-tipped nails, as if stroking something. A flash of comprehension lighted Cassie\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kittens. The damned little bloodsucking kittens that lived wild in Faye\u0027s bedroom. Faye was saying the kittens were her spies? That she could communicate with them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt a chill at her core as she looked at the tall, darkly beautiful girl, sensing something alien and deadly behind those hooded golden eyes. She\u0027d wondered all along who Faye had meant when she talked about her \"friends\" who saw things and reported back to her, but she\u0027d never imagined this. Faye smiled in feline satisfaction and nodded at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have lots of secrets,\" she said directly to Cassie. \"That\u0027s only one of them. But anyway,\" she said to the rest of the group, \"it was that night they got caught. They were - well, kissing. That\u0027s the polite way to put it. The kind of kissing that starts spontaneous combustion. I suppose they just couldn\u0027t resist their lustful passions any longer.\" She sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana was looking at Adam now, looking for a denial. But Adam, his jaw set, was staring straight ahead at Faye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s lips parted with the quick intake of her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it wasn\u0027t the only time, I\u0027m afraid,\" Faye continued, examining her nails with an expression of demure regret. \"They\u0027ve been doing it ever since, stealing secret moments when you weren\u0027t looking, Diana. Like at the Homecoming dance - what a pity you weren\u0027t there. They started kissing right in the middle of the dance floor. I guess maybe they went somewhere more private afterward ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true,\" Cassie cried, realizing even as she said it that she was virtually confirming that everything else Faye had said was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was looking at Cassie now, and there was no more jeering from the Hendersons. Their tilted blue-green eyes were focused and intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to tell you,\" Faye said to Diana, \"but Cassie just begged me not to. She was hysterical, crying and pleading - she said she would just die if you found out. She said she\u0027d do anything. And that,\" Faye sighed, looking off into the distance, \"was when she offered to get me the skull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Nick, his normally imperturbable face reflecting disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Faye\u0027s eyes dropped to her nails again, but she couldn\u0027t keep a smile from curling the corners of her lips. \"She knew I wanted to examine the skull, and she said she\u0027d get it for me if I didn\u0027t tell. Well, what could I do? She was like a crazy person. I just didn\u0027t have the heart to refuse her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie sank her teeth into her lower lip. She wanted to scream, to protest that it hadn\u0027t been that way . . . but what was the use?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie was speaking. \"And I suppose you didn\u0027t have the heart to refuse the skull, either,\" she said to Faye, her gray eyes scornful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ...\" Faye smiled deprecatingly. \"Let\u0027s put it this way - it was just too good a chance to miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t funny,\" Laurel cried. She looked stricken. \"I still don\u0027t believe it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how do you think she knew where to dig up the skull tonight?\" Faye said smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She stayed over at your house, Diana, the night we traced the dark energy to the cemetery. And she snuck around and figured out where the skull was buried by reading your Book of Shadows - but only after she stole the key to the walnut cabinet and checked there.\" Gleeful triumph shone out of Faye\u0027s golden eyes; she couldn\u0027t conceal it any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd nobody in the group could deny the truth of Faye\u0027s words any longer. Cassie had known where to dig up the skull. There was no way to get around that. Cassie could see it happening in face after face: the ending of disbelief and the slow beginning of grim accusation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like The Scarlet Letter, Cassie thought wildly as she stood apart with all of them looking at her. She might as well be standing up on a platform with an A pinned to her chest. Helplessly, she straightened her back and tried to hold her chin level, forcing herself to look back at the group. I will not cry, she thought. I will not look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw Diana\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s expression was beyond stricken. She seemed simply paralyzed, her green eyes wide and blank and shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She swore to be loyal and faithful to the Circle, and never to harm anyone inside it,\" Faye was saying huskily. \"But she lied. I suppose it\u0027s not surprising, considering she\u0027s half outsider. Still, 1 think it\u0027s gone on long enough; she and Adam have had enough time to enjoy themselves. So now you know the truth. And now,\" Faye finished, looking over the ravaged members of the Circle, and especially her deathly still cousin, with an air of thoughtful gratification, \"we\u0027d probably better be getting home. It\u0027s been a long night.\" Lazily, smiling faintly, she started to move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" It was a single word, but it stopped Faye in her tracks and it made everyone else turn toward Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie had never seen his blue-gray eyes look this way before - they were like silver lightning. He moved forward with his usual easy stride. There was no violence in the way he caught Faye\u0027s arm, but the grip must have been like iron - Cassie could tell that because Faye couldn\u0027t get away from it. Faye looked down at his fingers in offended surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had your turn,\" Adam said to her. His voice was carefully quiet, but the words dropped from his lips like chips of white-hot steel. \"Now it\u0027s mine. And all of you\" - he swung around on the group, holding them in place with his gaze - \"are going to listen.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-1.html","bookId":2097,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:49 PM"}
