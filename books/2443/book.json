He explains that the three hunters must find and hunt down the Vampaneze Lord if they have any hopes to win the war. He announces that two of them are Darren and Mr. Crepsley, but the third one they must find on their way. The hunters are told by Mr. Tiny that they will cross paths with the Lord of the Vampaneze four times throughout their quest, and have only those four chances to destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hunters-of-the-dusk-the-saga-of-darren-shan-7.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hunters-of-the-dusk-the-saga-of-darren-shan-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:16:18 PM"}
