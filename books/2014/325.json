I beg you, do not pollute me here on Earth for mere earthly gain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she speaks, he walks around her in a slow circle in the way of a thirsty man eyeing a particularly noxious pool of slime he must decide whether or not to drink from. “Have you done?” he asks when she falls silent, staring at him with huge eyes more hollow than bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flings herself facedown on the floor. “I am at your mercy,” she cries, face pressed to the carpets. “Do you mean to defile what has been made holy by God’s touch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ai, God,” he says in disgust. He is oddly shadowed, a trick of the light, perhaps, or else his complexion is much darker than that of most Wendish folk. Standing above her groveling form, he surveys her with a prim frown quite at odds with the sheathed energy with which he holds himself “If only my dear Eadgifu hadn’t died,” he says as the girl snivels at his feet. “She was a real woman. What I would give for one more tumble in bed with her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lust is the handmaiden of the Enemy,” she sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beg you,” he puts in, “pray do not delude yourself into thinking that you stir one grain of lust in me, Lady Tallia. It is your lineage I desire, not your person. Doubly descended from the throne of Wendar and the throne of Varre, and with so little to show for it! I would rather have my Eadgifu back. But God have made Their will manifest, and now we will be wed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did not the blessed Daisan enjoin us to cleanse ourselves of the stain of darkness that contaminates us here on Earth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he did.” He laughs, but he is not very amused. “I believe he preached that the road to purification lies through conception and birth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nay,” she cries, as he kneels beside her and sets a hand on her side, rolling her over. She scuttles back out of his reach. “That is the lie. You are mistaken in believing the error.” She fetches up, panting, against the heavy chair in which the elder woman had sat earlier. She opens her hands as though to reveal a sign, but it is only her palms, marked by pus and weeping sores. “Don’t you know of the blessed Daisan’s sacrifice and redemption? I am no more worthy than any other vessel, and yet God has chosen me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nay, your mother and I have chosen you. Good God. Get your servants to wash your hands properly after we’re through. Come now. Let’s get this over with.” He grabs her by an armpit and tugs her up toward the canopied bed, “Ai, Lady! You smell like sour milk. Don’t you ever wash?” He sits her on the bed, not ungently, but she falls back bonelessly and lies limp on the feather mattress as he begins to disrobe, quickly and without any amorous words or passionate glances. “Get you pregnant I must, so get your pregnant I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he is down to almost nothing, she begins to sob violently. She bolts from the bed, trying to find somewhere to hide, but there is quite obviously nowhere to hide. She runs to the door and pounds on it, but her bony fists make scarcely any sound, and the heavy door is shut tight. No one answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZacharias recoiled. He could not bear more of it. It was too horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is not the mating ceremony I remember,” said Kansi-a-lari with cool disdain, and as he reflexively wiped his hand on his robe, he realized that she was still watching the scene unfold through the gate, her eyes narrowing, then widening; her mouth parted on an exhaled breath as she drew back swiftly. Then she chuckled. “Nay, that is not as I remember it. Maybe the years have changed human kin. They do such violence to each other.” She shivered, as if a spider had crawled up her spine or the Enemy’s fingers touched her at the base of the neck. “Let us go on. Now I worry. Now I know I did not leave all my doubts behind. Why have they hidden my son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard going as they set off again. He felt as though he were walking through a huge vat of mud. Soon he was taking two breaths for every step, and then three, and then four. Only the horse seemed unaffected, even a little impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a rhythm going—step, breathe and breathe and breathe and breathe, step, breathe and breathe and breathe and breathe—and he would not have stopped as the path curled away to reveal the second gate worn thin, a pale pink rose incised with faint letters and incomprehensible sigils. But she stopped. Her eyes flared as she set a palm against the stone of the gate. He saw, first, the quiet sea below and, for a miracle, the distant shore lying clean and clear under a night sky. Stars blazed. He saw no moon.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-325.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
