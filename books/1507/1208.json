Before leaving the Ninth Mountain and Sea, he wanted to see... Ke Jiusi!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, although he could find the location of the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect, he was unable to enter. There was an invisible barrier in place that he could not pass without trying to break it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hovered quietly outside of the ruins for a while before finally clasping hands and bowing deeply. Then he turned and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a mountain peak inside the rubble of the sect, Ke Jiusi stood there looking at Meng Hao leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Night’s voice spoke out next to him: “Why didn’t you let him in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has Ji Tian’s Karma on him... and I have even more than he does. If the two of us met now... it would be harmful for him.” Ke Jiusi sighed, then turned his head to look out at the ruins stretching out beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ji Tian....” he murmured, cold killing intent gleaming in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao didn\u0027t get a chance to meet Ke Jiusi again. He left and headed toward the Ruins of Immortality. He needed to get the incomplete Paragon Bridge that he had copied to make his Paragon magic. Back then, he had been unable to take away the bridge itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, his own Paragon Bridge had already transformed. Thanks to the Bridge of Immortal Treading, it was no longer illusory, but corporeal. With his current cultivation base... he would be able to use his Paragon magic and merge it with the true broken Paragon Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA prismatic streak shot into the Ruins of Immortality as Meng Hao followed the same course as last time. He saw many of the same things he had seen before. He saw broken down temples and huge disembodied heads. He saw numerous corpses, shattered lands, destroyed magical items, and the ruins of palaces, all floating out in the void....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long time, he reached the area where he had created his Daoist magic, and then found the location where he had gained enlightenment of his Paragon magic... the shattered bridge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only a section of that bridge, but even from a distance and despite the fact that it had fallen into ruins, Meng Hao could sense the might of a Paragon emanating off of it, the incredible power of Heaven and Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis bridge had once spanned the highest Heavens, and had been the object of worship by countless life forms, all of whom deeply desired to walk upon it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, it was broken. Perhaps most of the bridge had faded away into the sands of time, and only this small section was what remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all the years that had passed, it remained in this one spot. No one had ever been able to take it away. Not even Ji Tian could take it, much less other Dao Realm cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, years ago, Meng Hao had forged his own Paragon magic by means of this bridge and thus had allowed it to become whole once again. It was that very Daoist magic that had earned him a spot in the Echelon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, he had returned to take the bridge away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you really the Paramita Bridge?” he asked softly. “Well, I\u0027m not completely certain what your previous name was, but I do know... that a lot of people know you.” He couldn’t help but think of the black-robed man who had emerged from the Paragon Painting in the Windswept Realm, and the expression on his face when he saw the Paragon Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps in the so-called Paramita, even Paragons need to walk across you... to truly become Paragons.... [1. The characters for Paramita can also be read “the other shore,” which might be relevant since we’re talking about a bridge here. Also, the “other shore” aspect plays into the meaning of the Buddhist concept of Paramita]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But today, I’m going to take you away. From now on, you... belong to Meng Hao. You are my... Paragon Bridge!” Meng Hao’s eyes shone with a bright light as he began to walk forward toward the bridge. The pressure of a Paragon rumbled out, and Meng Hao began to shine with scintillating light. He waved his right hand, and suddenly his Paragon Bridge appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Merge!” he roared, performing a double handed incantation gesture and then waving his finger toward his Paragon Bridge. Instantly, the two bridges began to merge together. The roar of the Bridge Soul could be heard from the Paragon Bridge as it ensured that nothing unexpected happened during the merger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the process continued, the pressure radiating off of the Paragon Bridge grew stronger. Rumbling filled the air, and everything grew dim. A wind swept through the Ruins of Immortality, as if the Paragon Bridge were truly awakening!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure intensified, and the Heavens trembled. The Ruins of Immortality quaked, and soon the entire Mountain and Sea Realm was imperceptibly shaking. No power of expulsion could be felt from the Mountains and Seas, and yet it seemed like a pair of invisible eyes had turned their gaze towards it, as if recalling memories of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t all... above the Mountain and Sea Realm, in the 33 Heavens, everything was shaking. Countless cultivators there were shocked, although they had no idea what exactly was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition... outside the 33 Heavens, far out in the great expanse, was a world in which several suns were hauling a huge statue. All of the cultivators there were also astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, it was also possible to see that in the land of the statue, which was growing inexorably closer to the Mountain and Sea Realm, there was also a bridge hovering in midair. It was also a Paragon Bridge, but it was in ruins, as if it were in place only as a symbol and had lost all of its previous significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat bridge also began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of woman spoke out, gloomy and serious: “Someone is awakening it....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the 33 Heavens, back in the Mountain and Sea Realm, in the Ruins of Immortality in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, Meng Hao threw his head back and roared. He suddenly flew up to stand atop the Paragon Bridge, where he first lifted his hands up into the air and then slammed them down onto the surface of the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Merge!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s Paragon Bridge began to descend as the merging quickened. The aura of a Paragon rose up into the air, inundating Meng Hao. Even though this was his own Paragon magic, he was still affected, and coughed up a mouthful of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, his eyes gleamed with focus. This time, he was going to take away the ruins of the Paragon Bridge no matter what! He was going to merge them with his own Paragon Bridge to make it stronger!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MERGE!” Meng Hao glowed with azure light as the Bridge Soul of his Paragon Bridge went all out, risking its own life as it controlled the bridge, causing it to descend further in its merging into the original bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time there was a force of expulsion, which turned into a powerful backlash attack. Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao’s mouth, and his Paragon Bridge appeared to be on the verge of collapsing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, the majesty of the broken bridge would not permit anyone to take control or ownership of it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meat jelly! Parrot! Get out here!” Meng Hao roared. Meng Hao wiped the blood off his lips as the meat jelly and parrot flew out of his bag of holding. As soon as they appeared, their eyes went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-y-you... what are you doing?!” the meat jelly said, trembling. The shattered bridge filled it with a sensation of complete terror. That bridge had once been powerful enough to affect Heaven and Earth, to shake the world. Even though that power was now broken, its aura was still there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s THAT bridge!!” the parrot squawked excitedly. “Suppress it! Fudge! Lord Fifth will definitely help you suppress it!” It transformed into a multi-colored streak of light that shot toward the broken Paragon Bridge. Meng Hao’s Paragon Bridge then increased its own pressure and began to descend once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meat jelly gritted its teeth and spread out as it transformed into a flying rope. Apparently, the moronic meat jelly had decided to try to tie the broken Paragon Bridge and Meng Hao’s Paragon Bridge together!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled the air as the Paragon Bridges continued to merge together. Meng Hao’s cultivation base was in full rotation, exploding with the full might of an Allheaven Dao Immortal. By now, the forced merger had reached the point where the broken bridge and Meng Hao’s Paragon Bridge were now almost completely superimposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was at this point that the power of a backlash attack, as well as the aura of expulsion both exploded out. Performing an incantation gesture, Meng Hao unleashed his Demon Sealing Hexing magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re already broken!” he shouted. “You might have been supreme and almighty in the past, but now you’re rubble! You’re incomplete, not even half of what you used to be. With the will of my Paragon magic, and the form of the Bridge of Immortal Treading, I won’t believe that I can’t absorb you!” His eyes were shot with blood, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. Gritting his teeth, he produced his fourth Nirvana Fruit and pressed it into his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mastiff!” he roared, and the mastiff flew out to form a cape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parrot!” The parrot and the copper mirror instantly formed together into the Battle Weapon. This time, it was not a long blade, but rather a glove! As the glove settled on Meng Hao’s hand, he took seven steps forward, building up massive energy and then unleashing a powerful punch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the God-Slaying Fist, Meng Hao’s most powerful fist strike, capable of shaking even cultivators of the Dao Realm. His Paragon Bridge was already beyond qualified to absorb the ruins of the bridge. With the power of the fist strike pouring into it, that last final distance between the two was closed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two bridges were completely superimposed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point a woman, dressed in white, had appeared up above. It was Paragon Sea Dream, who watched Meng Hao merge the two bridges, a complex expression on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment that the two bridges superimposed, the broken bridge trembled, and then... cracking sounds could be heard as it collapsed of its own accord! It was just like the World Tree, which destroyed itself rather than look up and see a sky controlled by the Ji Clan. The bridge was aware that it was simply too weak to do anything to prevent itself from being absorbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were anyone else, the bridge would be able to fight back, even if it were weaker than it was right now. However... Meng Hao was different. He had the will of the Paragon Bridge, and the form of the Bridge of Immortal Treading. He had a Bridge Soul. Essentially... Meng Hao’s Paragon Bridge was... the true supreme Paragon Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was not as paramount as the broken bridge had been, it was more complete!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince that was the case, there was no way for it to prevent the merging, so the broken bridge chose to use the last bit of its aura to destroy itself! It would rather explode... than be absorbed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face flickered as he looked at the broken bridge crumbling and turning into ash. Then his eyes shone with a shocking, icy gleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You would rather destroy yourself than be absorbed, huh...? Well then, go ahead and blow yourself up. Your death will allow my Paragon Bridge to take your place, to be born anew!” Roaring, Meng Hao pushed both hands down onto the Paragon Bridge, which instantly began to shine with brilliant light. Instead of attempting to merge with the broken bridge, the Paragon Bridge would consume it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would consume the ancient broken bridge to give itself new life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, there would be no broken bridge. There would only be Meng Hao’s Paragon Bridge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling could be heard as the Paragon Bridge voraciously consumed the flying ash that was the remnants of the broken bridge. As it did, its aura rose dramatically, shaking Heaven and Earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Paragon Bridge truly did have new life. It was now no longer illusory in any sense of the word. It was... completely corporeal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it became real, the 33 Heavens trembled, and all the bridges there collapsed. The incomplete bridge in the world of the statue, out in the vast expanse, also trembled and collapsed. For all eternity... it would never again exist!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the Ruins of Immortality, Paragon Sea Dream’s soft voice echoed out,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It used to have a name,” she said. “It was called the Heaven Tra--”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As of now,” Meng Hao interrupted, “it’s called the Paragon Bridge!” His words were not a show of disrespect. Rather, he didn’t want to hear the former name. What he cared about was the current bridge, not what it had been in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the Paragon Bridge to emit a rumbling drone. The Ruins of Immortality shook as the bridge faded away. Meng Hao clasped hands and bowed to Paragon Sea Dream, then turned and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParagon Sea Dream hovered there, watching Meng Hao make his way off. Her eyes flickered with an absent-minded gleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back in the day, Big Brother Nine Seals... was just as imposing....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1204: As Of Now, It’s Called the Paragon Bridge!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote from Deathblade:\u003c/strong\u003e The following is a little anecdote from Er Gen, translasted by anonpuffs. Keep in mind that in China, virtually all cell phones are basically pre-paid, although many allow you to overdraw your account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote from Er Gen:\u003c/strong\u003e Let me tell you an embarrassing story, this afternoon I made a phone call to my old lady. There was a notification that the phone card was overdrawn, so I paid 10 yuan (about U.S. $1.60 at the time) for her. Then I called a friend, and there was another notification about an overdrawn card, so I paid 10 yuan again. I ended up making 4 calls and every time the cards were overdrawn, so I got mad. I ended up paying 10 yuan every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I made yet another call, but outrageously enough they were overdrawn yet again. I got super mad and called customer service and let them have it.
