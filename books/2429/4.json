He had met her at the Section Christmas party back in \u002702, over a bowl of punch. He had just finished his schooling, just taken his first job with the City, just moved into the Section. He was living in one of the bachelor alcoves of Common Room 122A. Not bad for a bachelor alcove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was handing out the punch. \"I\u0027m Jessie,\" she said. \"Jessie Navodny. I don\u0027t know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baley,\" he said, \"Lije Baley. I\u0027ve just moved into the Section.\" He took his glass of punch and smiled mechanically. She impressed him as a cheerful and friendly person, so he stayed near her. He was new and it is a lonely feeling to be at a party where you find yourself watching people standing about in cliques of which you aren\u0027t a part. Later, when enough alcohol had trickled down throats, it might be better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, he remained at the punch bowl, watching the folks come and go and sipping thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I helped make the punch.\" The girl\u0027s voice broke in upon him. \"I can guarantee it. Do you want more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley realized his little glass was empty. He smiled and said, \"Yes.\" The girl\u0027s face was oval and not precisely pretty, mostly because of a slightly overlarge nose. Her dress was demure and she wore her light brown hair in a series of ringlets over her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe joined him in the next punch and he felt better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie,\" he said, feeling the name with his tongue. \"It\u0027s nice. Do you mind if I use it when I\u0027m talking to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. If you want to. Do you know what it\u0027s short for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t think of anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and said archly, \"My full name is Jezebel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when his interest flared. He put his punch glass down and said, intently, \"No, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly. I\u0027m not kidding. Jezebel. It\u0027s my real-for-true name on all my records. My parents liked the sound of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quite proud of it, even though there was never a less likely Jezebel in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, seriously, \"My name is Elijah, you know. My full name, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t register with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Elijah was Jezebel\u0027s great enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, sure. In the Bible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? I didn\u0027t know that. Now isn\u0027t that funny? I hope that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll have to be my enemy in real life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the very beginning there was no question of that. It was the coincidence of names at first that made her more than just a pleasant girl at the punch bowl. But afterward he had grown to find her cheerful, tender-hearted, and, finally, even pretty. He appreciated her cheerfulness particularly. His own sardonic view of life needed the antidote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jessie never seemed to mind his long grave face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, goodness,\" she said, \"what if you do look like an awful lemon? I know you\u0027re not really, and I guess if you were always grinning away like clockwork, the way I do, we\u0027d just explode when we got together. You stay the way you are, Lije, and keep me from floating away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she kept Lije Baley from sinking down. He applied for a small Couples apartment and got a contingent admission pending marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe showed it to her and said, \"Will you fix it so I can get out of Bachelor\u0027s, Jessie? I don\u0027t like it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it wasn\u0027t the most romantic proposal in the world, but Jessie liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley could only remember one occasion on which Jessie\u0027s habitual cheer deserted her completely and that, too, had involved her name. It was in their first year of marriage, and their baby had not yet come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it had been the very month in which Bentley was conceived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Their I.Q. rating, Genetic Values status, and his position in the Department entitled him to two children, of which the first might be conceived during the first year.) Maybe, as Baley thought back upon it, Bentley\u0027s beginnings might explain part of her unusual skittishness. Jessie had been drooping a bit because of Baley\u0027s consistent overtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"It\u0027s embarrassing to eat alone at the kitchen every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley was tired and out of sorts. He said, \"Why should it be? You can meet some nice single fellows there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course she promptly fired up. \"Do you think I can\u0027t make an impression on them, Lije Baley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was just because he was tired; maybe because Julius Enderby, a classmate of his, had moved up another notch on the C-scale rating while he himself had not. Maybe it was simply because he was a little tired of having her try to act up to the name she bore when she was nothing of the sort and never could be anything of the sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, he said bitingly, \"I suppose you can, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll try. I wish you\u0027d forget your name and be yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be just what I please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to be Jezebel won\u0027t get you anywhere. If you must know the truth, the name doesn\u0027t mean what you think, anyway. The Jezebel of the Bible was a faithful wife and a good one according to her lights. She had no lovers that we know of, cut no high jinks, and took no moral liberties at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie stared angrily at him. \"That isn\u0027t so. I\u0027ve heard the phrase, \u0027a painted Jezebel.\u0027 I know what that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you think you do, but listen. After Jezebel\u0027s husband, King Ahab died, her son, Jehoram, became king. One of the captains of his army, Jehu, rebelled against him and assassinated him. Jehu then rode to Jezreel where the old queen-mother, Jezebel, was residing. Jezebel heard of his coming and knew that he could only mean to kill her. In her pride and courage, she painted her face and dressed herself in her best clothes so that she could meet him as a haughty and defiant queen. He had her thrown from the window of the palace and killed, but she made a good end, according to my notions. And that\u0027s what people refer to when they speak of \u0027a painted Jezebel,\u0027 whether they know it or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next evening Jessie said in a small voice, \"I\u0027ve been reading the Bible, Lije.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" For a moment, Baley was honestly bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The parts about Jezebel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! Jessie, I\u0027m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I was being childish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No.\" She pushed his hand from her waist and sat on the couch, cool and upright, with a definite space between them. \"It\u0027s good to know the truth. I don\u0027t want to be fooled by not knowing. So I read about her. She was a wicked woman, Lije.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, her enemies wrote those chapters. We don\u0027t know her side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed all the prophets of the Lord she could lay her hands on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they say she did.\" Baley felt about in his pocket for a stick of chewing gum. (In later years he abandoned that habit because Jessie said that with his long face and sad, brown eyes, it made him look like an old cow stuck with an unpleasant wad of grass it couldn\u0027t swallow and wouldn\u0027t spit out.) He said, \"If you want her side, I could think of some arguments for you. She valued the religion of her ancestors who had been in the land long before the Hebrews came. The Hebrews had their own God, and, what\u0027s more, it was an exclusive God. They weren\u0027t content to worship Him themselves; they wanted everyone in reach to worship Him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jezebel was a conservative, sticking to the old beliefs against the new ones. After all, if the new beliefs had a higher moral content, the old ones were more emotionally satisfying. The fact that she killed priests just marks her as a child of her times. It was the usual method of proselytization in those days. If you read I Kings, you must remember that Elijah (my namesake this time) had a contest with 850 prophets of Baal to see which could bring down fire from heaven. Elijah won and promptly ordered the crowd of onlookers to kill the 850 Baalites. And they did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie bit her lip. \"What about Naboth\u0027s vineyard, Lije. Here was this Naboth not bothering anybody, except that he refused to sell the King his vineyard. So Jezebel arranged to have people perjure themselves and say that Naboth had committed blasphemy or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was supposed to have blasphemed God and the king,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. So they confiscated his property after they executed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was wrong. Of course, in modern times, Naboth would have been handled quite easily. If the City wanted his property or even if one of the Medieval nations had wanted his property, the courts would have ordered him off, had him removed by force if necessary, and paid him whatever they considered a fair price. King Ahab didn\u0027t have that way out. Still, Jezebel\u0027s solution was wrong. The only excuse for her is that Ahab was sick and unhappy over the situation and she felt that her love for her husband came ahead of Naboth\u0027s welfare. I keep telling you, she was the model of a faithful wi - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie flung herself away from him, red-faced and angry. \"I think you\u0027re mean and spiteful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her with complete dismay. \"What have I done? What\u0027s the matter with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left the apartment without answering and spent the evening and half the night at the subetheric video levels, traveling petulantly from showing to showing and using up a two-month supply of her quota allowance (and her husband\u0027s, to boot).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back to a still wakeful Lije Baley, she had nothing further to say to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to Baley later, much later, that he had utterly smashed an important part of Jessie\u0027s life. Her name had signified something intriguingly wicked to her. It was a delightful makeweight for her prim, over-respectable past. It gave her an aroma of licentiousness, and she adored that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was gone. She never mentioned her full name again, not to Lije, not to her friends, and maybe, for all Baley knew, not even to herself. She was Jessie and took to signing her name so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the days passed she began speaking to him again, and after a week or so their relationship was on the old footing and, with all subsequent quarrels, nothing ever reached that one bad spot of intensity. Only once was there even an indirect reference to the matter. It was in her eighth month of pregnancy. She had left her own position as dietitian\u0027s assistant in Section Kitchen A-23 and with unaccustomed time on her hands was amusing herself in speculation and preparation for the baby\u0027s birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, one evening, \"What about Bentley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me, dear?\" said Baley, looking up from a sheaf of work he had brought home with him. (With an additional mouth soon to feed and Jessie\u0027s pay stopped and his own promotions to the non-clerical levels as far off, seemingly, as ever, extra work was necessary.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean if the baby\u0027s a boy. What about Bentley as a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley pulled down the corners of his mouth. \"Bentley Baley? Don\u0027t you think the names are too similar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It has a swing, I think. Besides, the child can always pick out a middle name to suit himself when he gets older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s all right with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure? I mean... Maybe you wanted him to be named Elijah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And be called Junior? I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea. He can name his son Elijah, if he wants to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jessie said, \"There\u0027s just one thing,\" and stopped. After an interval, he looked up. \"What one thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not quite meet his eye, but she said, forcefully enough, \"Bentley isn\u0027t a Bible name, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Baley, \"I\u0027m quite sure it isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. I don\u0027t want any Bible names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the only harking back that took place from that time to the day when Elijah Baley was coming home with Robot Daneel Olivaw, when he had been married for more than eighteen years and when his son Bentley Baley (middle name still unclose) was past sixteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley paused before the large double door on which there glowed in large letters PERSONAL-MEN. In smaller letters were written SUBSECTIONS 1A-1E. In still smaller letters, just above the key slit, it stated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case of loss of key, communicate at once with 27-101-51.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man inched past them, inserted an aluminum sliver into the key slit, and walked in. He closed the door behind him, making no attempt to hold it open for Baley. Had he done so, Baley would have been seriously offended. By strong custom men disregarded one another\u0027s presence entirely either within or just outside the Personals. Baley remembered one of the more interesting marital confidences to have been Jessie\u0027s telling him that the situation was quite different at Women\u0027s Personals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was always saying, \"I met Josephine Greely at Personal and she said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the penalties of civic advancement that when the Baleys were granted permission for the activation of the small washbowl in their bedroom, Jessie\u0027s social life suffered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, without completely masking his embarrassment, \"Please wait out here, Daneel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you intend washing?\" asked R. Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley squirmed and thought: Damned robot! If they were briefing him on everything under steel, why didn\u0027t they teach him manners? I\u0027ll be responsible if he ever says anything like this to anyone else. He said, \"I\u0027ll shower. It gets crowded evenings. I\u0027ll lose time then. If I get it done now we\u0027ll have the whole evening before us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. Daneel\u0027s face maintained its repose. \"Is it part of the social custom that I wait outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley\u0027s embarrassment deepened. \"Why need you go in for - for no purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I understand you. Yes, of course. Nevertheless, Elijah, my hands grow dirty, too, and I will wash them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe indicated his palms, holding them out before him. They were pink and plump, with the proper creases. They bore every mark of excellent and meticulous workmanship and were as clean as need be. Baley said, \"We have a washbasin in the apartment, you know.\" He said it casually. Snobbery would be lost on a robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your kindness. On the whole, however, I think it would be preferable to make use of this place. If I am to live with you men of Earth, it is best that I adopt as many of your customs and attitudes as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on in, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright cheerfulness of the interior was a sharp contrast to the busy utilitarianism of most of the rest of the City, but this time the effect was lost on Baley\u0027s consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered to Daneel, \"I may take up to half an hour or so. Wait for me.\" He started away, then returned to add, \"And listen, don\u0027t talk to anybody and don\u0027t look at anybody. Not a word, not a glance! It\u0027s a custom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked hurriedly about to make certain that his own small conversation had not been noted, was not being met by shocked glances. Nobody, fortunately, was in the antecorridor, and after all it was only the antecorridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried down it, feeling vaguely dirty, past the common chambers to the private stalls. It had been five years now since he had been awarded one - large enough to contain a shower, a small laundry, and other necessities. It even had a small projector that could be keyed in for the news films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A home away from home,\" he had joked when it was first made available to him. But now, he often wondered how he would bear the adjustment back to the more Spartan existence of the common chambers if his stall privileges were ever canceled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed the button that activated the laundry and the smooth face of the meter lighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. Daneel was waiting patiently when Baley returned with a scrubbed body, clean underwear, a freshened shirt, and, generally, a feeling of greater comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No trouble?\" Baley asked, when they were well outside the door and able to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None at all, Elijah,\" said R. Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie was at the door, smiling nervously. Baley kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie,\" he mumbled, \"this is my new partner, Daneel Olivaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie held out a hand, which R. Daneel took and released. She turned to her husband, then looked timidly at R. Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Won\u0027t you sit down, Mr. Olivaw? I must talk to my husband on family matters. It\u0027ll take just a minute. I hope you won\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand was on Baley\u0027s sleeve. He followed her into the next room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, in a hurried whisper, \"You aren\u0027t hurt, are you? I\u0027ve been so worried ever since the broadcast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What broadcast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It came through nearly an hour ago. About the riot at the shoe counter. They said two plain-clothes men stopped it. I knew you were coming home with a partner and this was right in our subsection and right when you were coming home and I thought they were making it better than it was and you were - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Jessie. You see I\u0027m perfectly all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie caught hold of herself with an effort. She said, shakily, \"Your partner isn\u0027t from your division, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" replied Baley miserably. \"He\u0027s - a complete stranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I treat him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like anybody else. He\u0027s just my partner, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said it so unconvincingly, that Jessie\u0027s quick eyes narrowed. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Come, let\u0027s go back into the living room. It\u0027ll begin to look queer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLije Baley felt a little uncertain about the apartment now. Until this very moment, he had felt no qualms. In fact, he had always been proud of it. It had three large rooms; the living room, for instance, was an ample fifteen feet by eighteen. There was a closet in each room. One of the main ventilation ducts passed directly by. It meant a little rumbling noise on rare occasions, but, on the other hand, assured first-rate temperature control and well-conditioned air. Nor was it too far from either Personal, which was a prime convenience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with the creature from worlds beyond space sitting in the midst of it, Baley was suddenly uncertain. The apartment seemed mean and cramped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie said, with a gaiety that was slightly synthetic, \"Have you and Mr. Olivaw eaten, Lije?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact,\" said Baley, quickly, \"Daneel will not be eating with us. I\u0027ll eat, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie accepted the situation without trouble. With food supplies so narrowly controlled and rationing tighter than ever, it was good form to refuse another\u0027s hospitality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I hope you won\u0027t mind our eating, Mr. Olivaw. Lije, Bentley, and I generally eat at the Community kitchen. It\u0027s much more convenient and there\u0027s more variety, you see, and just between you and me, bigger helpings, too. But then, Lije and I do have permission to eat in our apartment three times a week if we want to - Lije is quite successful at the Bureau and we have very nice status - and I thought that just for this occasion, if you wanted to join us, we would have a little private feast of our own, though I do think that people who overdo their privacy privileges are just a bit anti-social, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. Daneel listened politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, with an undercover \"shushing\" wiggle of his fingers, \"Jessie, I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. Daneel said, \"Would I be breaking a custom, Mrs. Baley, if I addressed you by your given name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, no, of course not.\" Jessie folded a table out of the wall and plugged the plate warmer into the central depression on the table top. \"You just go right ahead and call me Jessie all you feel like - uh - Daneel.\" She giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt savage. The situation was getting rapidly more uncomfortable. Jessie thought R. Daneel a man. The thing would be someone to boast of and talk about in Women\u0027s Personal. He was good-looking in a wooden way, too, and Jessie was pleased with his deference. Anyone could see that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley wondered about R. Daneel\u0027s impression of Jessie. She hadn\u0027t changed much in eighteen years, or at least not to Lije Baley. She was heavier, of course, and her figure had lost much of its youthful vigor. There were lines at the angles of the mouth and a trace of heaviness about her cheeks. Her hair was more conservatively styled and a dimmer brown than it had once been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0027s all beside the point, thought Baley, somberly. On the Outer Worlds the women were tall and as slim and regal as the men. Or, at least, the book-films had them so and that must be the kind of women R. Daneel was used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut R. Daneel seemed quite unperturbed by Jessie\u0027s conversation, her appearance, or her appropriation of his name. He said, \"Are you sure that is proper? The name, Jessie, seems to be a diminutive. Perhaps its use is restricted to members of your immediate circle and I would be more proper if I used your full given name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie, who was breaking open the insulating wrapper surrounding the dinner ration, bent her head over the task in sudden concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Jessie,\" she said, tightly. \"Everyone calls me that. There\u0027s nothing else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, Jessie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and a youngster entered cautiously. His eyes found R. Daneel almost at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad?\" said the boy, uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son, Bentley,\" said Baley, in a low voice. \"This is Mr. Olivaw, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your partner, huh, Dad? How d\u0027ya do, Mr. Olivaw.\" Ben\u0027s eyes grew large and luminous. \"Say, Dad, what happened down in the shoe place? The newscast said - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ask any questions now, Ben,\" interposed Baley sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBentley\u0027s face fell and he looked toward his mother, who motioned him to a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you do what I told you, Bentley?\" she asked, when he sat down. Her hands moved caressingly over his hair. It was as dark as his father\u0027s and he was going to have his father\u0027s height, but all the rest of him was hers. He had Jessie\u0027s oval face, her hazel eyes, her light-hearted way of looking at life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Mom,\" said Bentley, hitching himself forward a bit to look into the double dish from which savory vapors were already rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we got to eat? Not zymoveal again, Mom? Huh, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing wrong with zymoveal,\" said Jessie, her lips pressing together. \"Now, you just eat what\u0027s put before you and let\u0027s not have any comments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quite obvious they were having zymoveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley took his own seat. He himself would have preferred something other than zymoveal, with its sharp flavor and definite aftertaste, but Jessie had explained her problem before this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I just can\u0027t, Lije,\" she had said. \"I live right here on these levels all day and I can\u0027t make enemies or life wouldn\u0027t be bearable. They know I used to be assistant dietitian and if I just walked off with steak or chicken every other week when there\u0027s hardly anyone else on the floor that has private eating privileges even on Sunday, they\u0027d say it was pull or friends in the prep room. It would be talk, talk, talk, and I wouldn\u0027t be able to put my nose out the door or visit Personal in peace. As it is, zymoveal and protoveg are very good. They\u0027re well-balanced nourishment with no waste and, as a matter of fact, they\u0027re full of vitamins and minerals and everything anyone needs and we can have all the chicken we want when we eat in Community on the chicken Tuesdays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley gave in easily. It was as Jessie said; the first problem of living is to minimize friction with the crowds that surround you on all sides. Bentley was a little harder to convince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this occasion, he said, \"Gee, Mom, why can\u0027t I use Dad\u0027s ticket and eat in Community myself? I\u0027d just as soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie shook her head in annoyance and said, \"I\u0027m surprised at you, Bentley. What would people say if they saw you eating by yourself as though your own family weren\u0027t good enough for you or had thrown you out of the apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, gosh, it\u0027s none of people\u0027s business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, with a nervous edge in his voice, \"Do as your mother tells you, Bentley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBentley shrugged, unhappily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. Daneel said, suddenly; from the other side of the room, \"Have I the family\u0027s permission to view these book-films during your meal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" said Bentley, slipping away from the table, a look of instant interest upon his face. \"They\u0027re mine. I got them from the library on special school permit. I\u0027ll get you my viewer. It\u0027s a pretty good one. Dad gave it to me for my last birthday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought it to R. Daneel and said, \"Are you interested in robots, Mr. Olivaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley dropped his spoon and bent to pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. Daneel said, \"Yes, Bentley. I am quite interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll like these. They\u0027re all about robots. I\u0027ve got to write an essay on them for school, so I\u0027m doing research. It\u0027s quite a complicated subject,\" he said importantly. \"I\u0027m against them myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Bentley,\" said Baley, desperately, \"and don\u0027t bother Mr. Olivaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not bothering me, Elijah. I\u0027d like to talk to you about the problem, Bentley, another time. Your father and I will be very busy tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Mr. Olivaw.\" Bentley took his seat and, with a look of distaste in his mother\u0027s direction, broke off a portion of the crumbly pink zymoveal with his fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley thought: Busy tonight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with a resounding shock, he remembered his job. He thought of a Spacer lying dead in Spacetown and realized that for hours he had been so involved with his own dilemma that he had forgotten the cold fact of murder. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-caves-of-steel-robot-1/page-4.html","bookId":2429,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:05 PM"}
