What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come back,” Isabelle said, and Jace sat up straight, the pillow tumbling to the floor. Her voice was tightly strained. He could hear the sharpness in it, like the off notes of a badly tuned piano. “To the Institute. Right away, Jace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” he asked. “What’s happened?” And he saw Magnus sit up too, the blanket dropping from his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sebastian,” Isabelle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace closed his eyes. He saw golden blood, and white feathers scattered across a marble floor. He remembered the apartment, a knife in his hands, the world at his feet, Sebastian’s grip on his wrist, those fathomless black eyes looking at him with dark amusement. There was a buzzing in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Magnus’s voice cut through Jace’s thoughts. He realized he was already at the door, the phone back in his pocket. He turned. Magnus was behind him, his expression stark. “Is it Alec? Is he all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you care?” said Jace, and Magnus flinched. Jace didn’t think he’d ever seen Magnus flinch before. It was the only thing that kept Jace from slamming the door on the way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were dozens of unfamiliar coats and jackets hanging in the entryway of the Institute. Clary felt the tight buzzing of tension in her shoulders as she unzipped her own wool coat and hung it on one of the hooks that lined the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Maryse didn’t say what this was about?” Clary demanded. The edges of her voice had been rubbed thin by anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJocelyn had unwound a long gray scarf from around her neck, and barely looked as Luke took it from her to drape it on a hook. Her green eyes were darting around the room, taking in the gate of the elevator, the arched ceiling overhead, the faded murals of men and angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuke shook his head. “Just that there’d been an attack on the Clave, and we needed to get here as quickly as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the ‘we’ part that concerns me.” Jocelyn wound her hair up into a knot at the back of her head, and secured it with her fingers. “I haven’t been in an Institute in years. Why do they want me here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuke squeezed her shoulder reassuringly. Clary knew what Jocelyn feared, what they all feared. The only reason the Clave would want Jocelyn here was if there was news of her son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maryse said they’d be in the library,” Jocelyn said. Clary led the way. She could hear Luke and her mother talking behind her, and the soft sound of their footsteps, Luke’s slower than they had once been. He hadn’t entirely recovered from the injury that had nearly killed him in November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know why you’re here, don’t you, breathed a soft voice in the back of her head. She knew it wasn’t really there, but that didn’t help. She hadn’t seen her brother since the fight at the Burren, but she carried him in some small part of her mind, an intrusive, unwelcome ghost. Because of me. You always knew I hadn’t gone away forever. I told you what would happen. I spelled it out for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErchomai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached the library. The door was half-open, and a babble of voices spilled through. Jocelyn paused for a moment, her expression tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClary put her hand on the doorknob. “Are you ready?” She hadn’t noticed till then what her mother was wearing: black jeans, boots, and a black turtleneck. As if, without thinking of it, she had put on the closest thing she had to fighting gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJocelyn nodded at her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had pushed back all the furniture in the library, clearing a large space in the middle of the room, just atop the mosaic of the Angel. A massive table had been placed there, a huge slab of marble balanced on top of two kneeling stone angels. Around the table were seated the Conclave. Some members, like Kadir and Maryse, Clary knew by name. Others were just familiar faces. Maryse was standing, ticking off names on her fingers as she chanted aloud. “Berlin,” she said. “No survivors. Bangkok. No survivors. Moscow. No survivors. Los Angeles—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Los Angeles?” said Jocelyn. “That was the Blackthorns. Are they—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryse looked startled, as if she hadn’t realized Jocelyn had come in. Her blue eyes swept over Luke and Clary. She looked drawn and exhausted, her hair scraped back severely, a stain—red wine or blood?—on the sleeve of her tailored jacket. “There were survivors,” she said. “Children. They’re in Idris now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Helen,” said Alec, and Clary thought of the girl who had fought with them against Sebastian at the Burren. She remembered her in the nave of the Institute, a dark-haired boy clinging to her wrist. My brother, Julian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aline’s girlfriend,” Clary blurted out, and saw the Conclave look at her with thinly veiled hostility. They always did, as if who she was and what she represented made them almost unable to see her. Valentine’s daughter. Valentine’s daughter. “Is she all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was in Idris, with Aline,” said Maryse. “Her younger brothers and sisters survived, although there seems to have been an issue with the eldest brother, Mark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An issue?” said Luke. “What’s going on, exactly, Maryse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think we’ll know the whole story until we get to Idris,” said Maryse, smoothing back her already smooth hair. “But there have been attacks, several in the course of two nights, on six Institutes. We’re not sure yet how the Institutes were breached, but we know—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sebastian,” said Clary’s mother. She had her hands jammed into the pockets of her black trousers, but Clary suspected that if she hadn’t, Clary would have been able to see that her mother’s hands were tightened into fists. “Cut to the point, Maryse. My son. You wouldn’t have called me here if he wasn’t responsible. Would you?” Jocelyn’s eyes met Maryse’s, and Clary wondered if this was how it had been when they’d both been in the Circle, the sharp edges of their personalities rubbing up against each other, causing sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Maryse could speak, the door opened and Jace came in. He was flushed with the cold, bareheaded, fair hair tousled by the wind. His hands were gloveless, red at the tips from the weather, scarred with Marks new and old. He saw Clary and gave her a quick smile before settling into a chair propped against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuke, as usual, moved to make peace. “Maryse? Is Sebastian responsible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryse took a deep breath. “Yes, yes he was. And he had the Endarkened with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it’s Sebastian,” said Isabelle. She had been staring down at the table; now she raised her head. Her face was a mask of hatred and rage. “He said he was coming; well, now he’s come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryse sighed. “We assumed he’d attack Idris. That was what all the intelligence indicated. Not Institutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he did the thing you didn’t expect,” said Jace. “He always does the thing you don’t expect. Maybe the Clave should plan for that.” Jace’s voice dropped. “I told you. I told you he’d want more soldiers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jace,” said Maryse. “You’re not helping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t trying to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would have thought he’d attack here first,” said Alec. “Given what Jace was saying before, and it’s true—everyone he loves or hates is here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t love anyone,” Jocelyn snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, stop,” Clary said. Her heart was pounding, sick in her chest; yet at the same time there was a strange sense of relief. All this time waiting for Sebastian to come, and now he had. Now the waiting was over. Now the war would start. “So what are we supposed to do? Fortify the Institute? Hide?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess,” said Jace, his voice dripping sarcasm. “The Clave’s called for a Council. Another meeting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Clave has called for immediate evacuation,” said Maryse, and at that, everyone went silent, even Jace. “All Institutes are to empty out. All Conclaves must return to Alicante. The wards around Idris will be doubled after tomorrow. No one will be able to come in or get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabelle swallowed. “When do we leave New York?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryse straightened up. Some of her usual imperious air was back, her mouth a thin line, her jaw set with determination. “Go and pack,” she said. “We leave tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTAND OR FALL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaking was like being plunged into a bath of icy water. Emma sat up straight, torn out of sleep, her mouth opening on a scream. “Jules! Jules!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was movement in the darkness, a hand on her arm, and a sudden light that stung her eyes. Emma gasped and scrabbled backward, pushing herself among the cushions—she was lying on a bed, she realized, pillows stacked behind her back and the sheets twisted around her body in a sweaty tangle. She blinked the darkness out of her eyes, trying to focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Blackthorn was leaning over her, blue-green eyes worried, a witchlight glowing in her hand. They were in a room with a steeply gabled roof, slanting down hard on either side, like in a fairytale cabin. A big four-poster wooden bed was in the center of the room, and in the shadows behind Helen, Emma could see furniture looming: a big square wardrobe, a long sofa, a table with rickety legs. “W-where am I?” Emma gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Idris,” Helen said, stroking her arm in a soothing manner. “You made it to Idris, Emma. We’re in the attic of the Penhallows’ house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“M-my parents.” Emma’s teeth chattered. “Where are my parents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You came through the Portal with Julian,” said Helen gently, not answering her question. “All of you made it through somehow—it’s a miracle, you know. The Clave opened the way, but Portal travel is hard. Dru came through holding on to Tavvy, and the twins came through together, of course. And then, when we’d almost given up hope, you two. You were unconscious, Em.” She brushed Emma’s hair back from her forehead. “We were so worried. You should have seen Jules—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” Emma demanded. She pulled back from Helen’s touch, not because she didn’t like Helen but because her heart was pounding. “What about Mark, and Mr. Blackthorn—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen hesitated. “Sebastian Morgenstern has attacked six Institutes over the past few days. He’s either killed everyone or Turned them. He can use the Infernal Cup to make Shadowhunters—not themselves anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw him do it,” Emma whispered. “To Katerina. And he Turned your father, too. They were going to do it to Mark, but Sebastian said he didn’t want him because he had faerie blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen flinched. “We have reason to think Mark’s still alive,” she said. “They were able to track him to a point where he disappeared, but the runes indicate he’s not dead. It’s possible that Sebastian may be holding him hostage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My—my parents,” Emma said again, through a dryer throat this time. She knew what it meant that Helen hadn’t answered her question the first time she’d asked it. “Where are they? They weren’t in the Institute, so Sebastian couldn’t have hurt them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Em . . .” Helen exhaled. She looked young suddenly, almost as young as Jules. “Sebastian doesn’t just attack Institutes; he murders or takes Conclave members from their own homes. Your parents—the Clave tried to track them, but they couldn’t. Then their bodies washed up in Marina del Rey, on the beach, this morning. The Clave doesn’t know what happened exactly, but . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen’s voice trailed off into a meaningless string of words, words such as “positive identification” and “scars and markings on the bodies” and “no evidence recovered.” Things like “in the water for hours” and “no way to transport the corpses” and “given all the proper funeral rites, burned on the beach as they had both requested, you understand—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma screamed. It was a scream with no words at first, rising higher and higher, a scream that tore her throat and brought the taste of metal into her mouth. It was a scream of loss so immense there was no speech for it. It was the wordless cry of having the sky over your head, the air in your lungs, ripped away from you forever. She screamed, and screamed again, and tore at the mattress with her hands until she gouged through it, and there were feathers and blood stuck under her fingernails, and Helen was sobbing, trying to hold her, saying, “Emma, Emma, please, Emma, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was more illumination. Someone had turned on a lantern in the room, and Emma heard her name, in a soft urgent familiar voice, and Helen let her go and there was Jules, leaning against the edge of the bed, and holding something out to her, something that gleamed gold in the new harsh light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Cortana. Unsheathed, lying bare across his palms like an offering. Emma thought she was still screaming, but she took the sword, the words flashing across the blade, burning across her eyes: I am Cortana, of the same steel and temper as Joyeuse and Durendal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard her father’s voice in her head. Carstairs have carried this sword for generations. The inscription reminds us that Shadowhunters are the Angel’s weapons. Temper us in the fire, and we grow stronger. When we suffer, we survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma choked, pushing back on the screams, forcing them down and into silence. This was what her father had meant: Like Cortana, she had steel in her veins and she was meant to be strong. Even if her parents were not there to see it, she would be strong for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged the sword against her chest. As if from a distance she heard Helen exclaim and reach for her, but Julian, Julian who always knew what Emma needed, tugged Helen’s hand back. Emma’s fingers were around the blade, and blood was running down her arms and chest where the tip sliced at her collarbone. She didn’t feel it. Rocking back and forth, she clutched the sword like it was the only thing she had ever loved, and let the blood spill down instead of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon couldn’t quite shake a feeling of déjà vu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been here before, standing just outside the Institute, watching the Lightwoods disappear through a shimmering Portal. Though then, back before he had ever borne the Mark of Cain, the Portal had been created by Magnus, and this time it was under the oversight of a blue-skinned warlock woman named Catarina Loss. That time, he’d been summoned because Jace had wanted to talk to him about Clary before he disappeared into another country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Clary was disappearing with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her hand on his, her fingers lightly ringing his wrist. The whole of the Conclave—nearly every Shadowhunter in New York City—had come through the gates of the Institute and passed through the shimmering Portal. The Lightwoods, as guardians of the Institute, would go last. Simon had been here since the start of twilight, bars of red sky sliding down behind the buildings of the New York skyline, and now witchlight lit the scene in front of him, picking out small glimmering details: Isabelle’s whip, the spark of fire that jumped from Alec’s family ring as he gestured, the glints in Jace’s pale hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks different,” Simon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClary looked up at him. Like the rest of the Shadowhunters, she was dressed in what Simon could only describe as a cloak. It seemed to be what they broke out during cold winter weather, made of a heavy, velvety black material that buckled across the chest. He wondered where she’d gotten it. Maybe they just issued them. “What does?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Portal,” he said. “It looks different from when Magnus did it. More—blue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe they all have different senses of style?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon looked over at Catarina. She seemed briskly efficient, like a hospital nurse or kindergarten teacher. Definitely not like Magnus. “How’s Izzy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worried, I think. Everyone’s worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short silence. Clary exhaled, her breath floating white on the winter air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like you going,” Simon said, at exactly the same time that Clary said, “I don’t like going and leaving you here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be fine,” Simon said. “I have Jordan looking after me.” Indeed, Jordan was there, sitting on top of the wall that ran around the Institute and looking watchful. “And no one’s tried to kill me in at least two weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not funny.” Clary scowled. The problem, Simon reflected, was that it was difficult to reassure someone that you’d be fine when you were a Daylighter. Some vampires might want Simon on their side, eager to benefit from his unusual powers. Camille had attempted to recruit him, and others might try, but Simon had the distinct impression that the vast majority of vampires wanted to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m pretty sure Maureen’s still hoping to get her hands on me,” Simon said. Maureen was the head of the New York vampire clan and believed that she was in love with Simon. Which would have been less awkward if she hadn’t been thirteen years old. “I know the Clave warned people not to touch me, but . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maureen wants to touch you,” Clary said with a sideways grin. “Bad touch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Silence, Fray.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jordan will keep her off you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon looked ahead meditatively. He had been trying not to stare at Isabelle, who had greeted him with only a brief wave since he’d arrived at the Institute. She was helping her mother, her black hair flying in the brisk wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could just go up and talk to her,” Clary said. “Instead of staring like a creeper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not staring like a creeper. I’m staring subtly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I noticed,” Clary pointed out. “Look, you know how Isabelle gets. When she’s upset, she withdraws. She won’t talk to anyone but Jace or Alec, because she hardly trusts anyone. But if you’re going to be her boyfriend, you have to show her you’re one of those people she can trust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not her boyfriend. At least, I don’t think I’m her boyfriend. She’s never used the word ‘boyfriend,’ anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClary kicked him in the ankle. “You two need to DTR more than any other people I’ve ever met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Defining relationships over here?” said a voice from behind them. Simon turned and saw Magnus, very tall against the dark sky behind them. He was soberly dressed, jeans and a black T-shirt, his dark hair partly in his eyes. “I see that even as the world plunges into darkness and peril, you two stand around discussing your love lives. Teenagers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?” Simon said, too surprised for a smart comeback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Came to see Alec,” Magnus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClary raised her eyebrows at him. “What was that about teenagers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnus held up a warning finger. “Don’t overstep yourself, biscuit,” he said, and moved past them, disappearing into the crowd around the Portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Biscuit?” said Simon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Believe it or not, he’s called me that before,” Clary said. “Simon, look.” She turned toward him, tugging his hand out of his jeans pocket. She looked down at it and smiled. “The ring,” she said. “Handy when it worked, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon looked down as well. A hammered gold ring in the shape of a leaf encircled his right ring finger. It had once been a connection to Clary. Now, with hers destroyed, it was only a ring, but he kept it regardless. He knew it was a little close to having half of a BFF necklace, but he couldn’t help it. It was a beautiful object, and still a symbol of the connection between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed his hand hard, raising her eyes to his. Shadows moved in the green of her irises; he could tell she was afraid. “I know it’s just a Council meeting—” Clary started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re staying in Idris.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only until they can figure out what happened with the Institutes, and how to protect them,” said Clary. “Then we’ll come back. I know phones and texting and all that, that doesn’t work in Idris, but if you need to talk to me, tell Magnus. He’ll find a way to get me a message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon felt his throat tighten. “Clary—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” she said. “You’re my best friend.” She let go of his hand, her eyes shining. “No, don’t say anything, I don’t want you to say anything.” She turned and almost ran back toward the Portal, where Jocelyn and Luke were waiting for her, three packed duffel bags at their feet. Luke glanced across the courtyard at Simon, his expression thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where was Isabelle? The crowd of Shadowhunters had thinned. Jace had moved to stand beside Clary, his hand on her shoulder; Maryse was near the Portal, but Isabelle, who had been with her—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simon,” said a voice at his shoulder, and he turned to see Izzy, her face a pale smudge between dark hair and dark cloak, looking at him, her expression half-angry, half-sad. “I guess this is the part where we say good-bye?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-heavenly-fire-the-mortal-instruments-6/page-4.html","bookId":2008,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:45 PM"}
