The blade traced a complicated series of graceful arcs in the air. The few remaining Naval personnel on the deck turned pale and averted their eyes—a Spartan wielding a knife was gen- erally accompanied by the presence of several dead bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was nervous, and this was more than the normal pre-mission jitters. The team\u0027s original objective—the capture of a Covenant ship—had been scrubbed in the face of a new enemy offensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant were en route to Reach, the last of the United Na- tions Space Command\u0027s major military strongholds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred couldn\u0027t help but wonder what use ground troops would be in a ship-to-ship engagement. The knife spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him, his squadmates loaded weapons, stacked gear, and prepped for combat, their efforts redoubled since the ship\u0027s Captain had personally come down to the mustering area to brief the team leader, SPARTAN-117—but Fred was already squared away. Only Kelly had finished stowing gear before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe balanced the point of the knife on his armored finger. It hung there for several seconds, perfectly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA subtle shift in the Pillar of Autumn\u0027s gravity caused the knife to tip. Fred plucked it from the air and sheathed it in a single deft move. A cold feeling filled his stomach as he realized what the gravity fluctuation meant: The ship had just changed course—another complication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Chief SPARTAN-117—John—marched to the nearest COM panel as Captain Keyes\u0027s face filled the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred sensed a slight movement to his right—a subtle hand sig- nal from Kelly. He opened a private COM freq to his teammate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like we\u0027re in for more surprises,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that,\" he replied, \"though I think I\u0027ve had enough surprises for one op.\" Kelly chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred focused his attention on John\u0027s exchange with Keyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach Spartan—selected from an early age and trained to the pin- nacle of military science—had undergone multiple augmenta- tion procedures: biochemical, genetic, and cybernetic. As a result, a Spartan could hear a pin drop in a sandstorm, and every Spartan in the room was interested in what the Captain had to say. If you \u0027re going to drop into hell, CPO Mendez, the Spartans\u0027 first teacher, had once said, you may as well drop with good intel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Keyes frowned on the ship\u0027s viewscreen, a nonregula-tion pipe in his hand. Though his voice was calm, the Captain\u0027s grip on the pipe was white-knuckle tight as he outlined the situation. A single space vessel docked in Reach\u0027s orbital facilities had failed to delete its navigational database. If the NAV data fell into Covenant hands, the enemy would have a map to Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master Chief,\" the Captain said, \"I believe the Covenant will use a pinpoint Slipspace jump to a position just off the space dock. They may try to get their troops on the station before the Super MAC guns can take out their ships. This will be a difficult mission, Chief. I\u0027m... open to suggestions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can take care of it,\" the Master Chief replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Keyes\u0027s eyes widened and he leaned forward in his command chair. \"How exactly, Master Chief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With all due respect, sir, Spartans are trained to handle difficult missions. I\u0027ll split my squad. Three will board the space dock and make sure that NAV data does not fall into the Covenant\u0027s hands. The remainder of the Spartans will go groundside and re- pel the invasion forces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred gritted his teeth. Given his choice, he\u0027d rather fight the Covenant on the ground. Like his fellow Spartans, he loathed off-planet duty. The op to board the space dock would be fraught with danger at every turn—unknown enemy deployment, no gravity, useless intel, no dirt beneath his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no question, though: The space op was the toughest duty, so Fred intended to volunteer for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Keyes considered John\u0027s suggestion. \"No, Master Chief. It\u0027s too risky—we\u0027ve got to make sure the Covenant don\u0027t get that NAV data. We\u0027ll use a nuclear mine, set it close to the docking ring, and detonate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, the EMP will burn out the superconductive coils of the orbital guns. And if you use the Pillar of Autumn\u0027s conventional weapons, the NAV database may still survive. If the Covenant search the wreckage—they may obtain the data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" Keyes said and tapped his pipe thoughtfully to his chin. \"Very well, Master Chief. We\u0027ll go with your suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll plot a course over the docking station. Ready your Spartans and prep two dropships. We\u0027ll launch you—\" He consulted with Cortana.\"—in five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, Captain. We\u0027ll be ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" Captain Keyes said, and the viewscreen went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred snapped to attention as the Master Chief turned to face the Spartans. Fred began to step forward— —but Kelly beat him to it. \"Master Chief,\" she said, \"permission to lead the space op.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had always been faster, damn her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Denied,\" the Master Chief said. \"I\u0027ll be leading that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Linda and James,\" he continued. \"You\u0027re with me. Fred, you\u0027re Red Team leader. You\u0027ll have tactical command of the ground operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir!\" Fred shouted and started to voice a protest—then squelched it. Now wasn\u0027t the time to question orders.. . as much as he wanted to. \"Yes, sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now make ready,\" the Master Chief said. \"We don\u0027t have much time left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans stood a moment. Kelly called out, \"Attention!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers snapped to and gave the Master Chief a crisp salute, which was promptly returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred switched to Red Team\u0027s all-hands freq and barked, \"Let\u0027s move, Spartans! I want gear stowed in ninety seconds, and final prep in five minutes. Joshua: Liaise with Cortana and get me current intel on the drop area—I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s just weather satellite imagery, but I want pictures, and I want them ninety seconds ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed Team jumped into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pre-mission jitters were gone, replaced with a cold calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a job to do, and Fred was eager to get to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlight Officer Mitchell flinched as a stray energy burst streaked into the landing bay and vaporized a meter-wide section of bulk- head. Red-hot, molten metal splattered the Pelican dropship\u0027s viewport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew this, he thought, and hit the Pelican\u0027s thrusters. The gunmetal-green transport balanced for a moment on a column of blue-white fire, then hurtled out of the Pillar of Autumn\u0027s launch bay and into space. Five seconds later all hell broke loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncoming energy bursts from the lead Covenant vessels cut across their vector and slammed into a COMSat. The communi- cations satellite broke apart, disintegrating into glittering shards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better hang on,\" Mitchell announced to his passengers in the dropship\u0027s troop bay. \"Company\u0027s coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA swarm of Seraphs—the Covenant\u0027s scarablike attack fighters—fell into tight formation and arced through space on an intercept course for the dropship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican\u0027s engines flared and the bulky ship plummeted toward the surface of Reach. The alien fighters accelerated and plasma bursts flickered from their gunports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn energy bolt slashed past on the port side, narrowly missing the Pelican\u0027s cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell\u0027s voice crackled across the COM system: \"Bravo-One to Knife Two-Six: I could use a little help here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled the Pelican to port to avoid a massive, twisted hunk of wreckage from a patrol cutter that had strayed too close to the oncoming assault wave. Beneath the blackened plasma scorches, he could just make out the UNSC insigne. Mitchell scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was getting worse by the second. \"Bravo-One to Knife Two-Six, where the hell are you?\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quartet of wedge-shaped, angular fighters slotted into cover- ing position on Mitchell\u0027s scopes—Longswords, heavy fighters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knife Two-Six to Bravo-One,\" a terse, female voice crackled across the COM channel. \"Keep your pants on. Business is good today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo good. No sooner had the fighters taken escort position over his dropship than the approaching Covenant fighters opened up with a barrage of plasma fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree of the Pelican\u0027s four Longsword escorts peeled off and powered toward the Covenant ships. Against the black of space, cannons flashed and missiles etched ghostly trails; Covenant energy weapons cut through the night and explosions dotted the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican and its sole escort, however, accelerated straight toward the planet. It shot past whirling wreckage; it rolled and maneuvered as missiles and plasma bolts crisscrossed their path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell flinched as Reach\u0027s orbital defense guns fired in a hot, actinic flash. A white ball of molten metal screamed directly over the Pelican and its escort as they rocketed beneath the de- fense platform\u0027s ring-shaped superstructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell sent the Pelican into the planet\u0027s atmosphere. Va- porous flames flickered across the ship\u0027s stunted nose, and the Pelican jounced from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bravo-One, adjust attack angle,\" the Longsword pilot ad- vised. \"You\u0027re coming in too hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative,\" Mitchell said. \"We\u0027re getting to the surface fast— or we\u0027re not getting there at all. Enemy contacts on my scopes at four by three o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen more Covenant Seraphs fired their engines and an- gled toward the two descending ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affirmative: four by three. I\u0027ve got \u0027em, Bravo-One,\" the Longsword pilot announced. \"Give \u0027em hell down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Longsword flipped into a tight roll and rocketed for the Covenant formation. There was no chance that the pilot could take out a dozen Seraphs—and Knife Two-Six had to know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell only hoped that the precious seconds Two-Six bought them would be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican opened its intake vents and ignited afterburners, plummeting toward the ground at thirteen hundred meters per second. The faint aura of flames around the craft roared from red to blinding orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican\u0027s aft section had been stripped of the padded crash seats that usually lined the section\u0027s port and starboard sides. The life-support generators on the firewall between pas- senger and pilot\u0027s compartment had also been discarded to make room. Under other circumstances, such modifications would have left the Pelican\u0027s troop bay unusually cavernous. Every square centimeter of space, however, was occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-seven Spartans braced themselves and clung to the frame of the ship; they crouched in their MJOLNIR armor to ab- sorb the shock of their rapid descent. Their armor was half a ton of black alloy, faintly luminous green ceramic plates, and wink- ing energy shield emitters. Polarized visors and full helmets made them look part Greek hero and part tank—more machine than human. At their feet equipment bags and ammunition boxes were lashed in place. Everything rattled as the ship jostled through the increasingly dense air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred hit the COM and barked: \"Brace yourselves!\" The ship lurched, and he struggled to keep his footing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPARTAN-087, Kelly, moved nearer and opened a frequency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief, we\u0027ll get that COM malfunction squared away after we hit planetside,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred winced when he realized that he\u0027d just broadcast on FLEETCOM 7: He\u0027d spammed every ship in range. Damn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened a private channel to Kelly. \"Thanks,\" he said. Her reply was a subtle nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew better than to make such a simple mistake—and as his second in command, Kelly was rattled by his mistake with the COM, too. He needed her rock-solid. He needed all of Red Team frosty and wired tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant that he needed to make sure he held it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked the squad\u0027s biomonitors. They showed all green on his heads-up display, with pulse rates only marginally accel- erated. The dropship\u0027s pilot was a different story. Mitchell\u0027s heart fired like an assault rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny problems with Red Team weren\u0027t physical; the biomoni- tors confirmed that much. Spartans were used to tough missions; UNSC High Command never sent them on any \"easy\" jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir job this time was to get groundside and protect the gen- erators that powered the orbiting Magnetic Accelerator Cannon platforms. The fleet was getting ripped to shreds in space. The massive MAC guns were the only thing keeping the Covenant from overrunning their lines and taking Reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred knew that if anything had Kelly and the other Spartans rattled, it was leaving behind the Master Chief and his hand-picked Blue Team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred would have infinitely preferred to be with Blue Team. He knew every Spartan here felt like they were taking the easy way out. If the ship-jockeys managed to hold off the Covenant as- sault wave, Red Team\u0027s mission was a milk run, albeit a neces- sary one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly\u0027s hand bumped into Fred\u0027s shoulder, and he recognized it as a consoling gesture. Kelly\u0027s razor-edged agility was multi- plied fivefold by the reactive circuits in her MJOLNIR armor. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-1.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
