He was also in shock. He clearly didn’t know the current state of affairs. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHai Shui replied, “Why isn’t it possible? The three main powers are currently all preparing their militaries! Anytime now, they’ll start a civil war.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI sighed. “War is the cruelest! If war really happens, the commoners will be ones that suffers the most. Furthermore, the kingdom’s power will weaken drastically during a civil war. It’ll disturb the balance between the three kingdoms.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHai Shui stared at me for a while, eyes wide. “Wow~ I didn’t expect that you’d analyze the situation like that. It would be great if you joined our Xing family. With your magic power, it should be able to bring the family to it’s peak!” \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI laughed and anxiously looked at Ma Ke. “I think that we should forget about that suggestion as even the problem we currently have with your sister can’t be solved.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMa Ke supported me, saying, “Right, right! You should stop putting Zhang Gong on the spot!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHai Shui pouted her cute and small lips, “\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHumph\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e! Sister isn’t the problem! I don’t care! Are you going to tell me if you’re going to agree or not? I’ll just ask my grandfather, okay?” ‘\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHai Shui was one of the candidates to inherit the Xing Family so her position in the family was very high. If she really suggested for me to enter her family, the chance of success would definitely be very high\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e.’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI immediately shook my head. “No! Just forget it! I don’t want to be restrained and love my freedom. Moreover, I just offended the Ri family. If I join your family, won’t it lead to conflict between the two families?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHai Shui lowered her head and thought. “What you said is right! However, my offer still stands. If you ever change your mind, you must tell me! You carry on having your meals; I’ll head back first.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Ma Ke focused on Hai Shui’s back as she left, he said to me, “Boss, thank you! I know that you refused Hai Shui because of me. I really don’t know what…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI patted his shoulder. “Stop saying such things! We are brothers! Anyway, I won’t join your family as well. Honestly, I hope that this will not result in war! Is peace so bad? We can only continue flourishing ourselves if we stay united. During my previous adventures, I met the Magic race. They didn’t look at our human race with good intentions and rather wanted us gone. If we have an internal war, won’t it be the perfect chance for them to invade us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Magic race? Boss, you met the Magic race?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yup! Why?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is a big issue! I will immediately inform my father. The information that the Magic race might invade us is super important!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI curiously asked, “You don’t need to be this nervous, right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMa Ke rebuked, “How could I not be nervous? The Magic race must have used an unknown method to enter the our Eastern continent. This proves that they have terrible intentions towards our human race. This information is extremely important!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI scratched my head and thought back to the exquisite, beautiful face of the Magic race’s princess. “The Magic race isn’t that terrifying. They are just like us, living in the world. Why do you look like you’ve met a ghost?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Magic race and our human kind are not the same! They are enemies to all of the human race.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright! I don’t want to continue arguing with you. Just do whatever you like! Let’s quickly finish our meal! I want to head back to the dormitory for a break.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMa Ke left the academy and headed home to report the important information to his father that night.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDuring the next day’s class, I wrote another letter to Mu Zi. I wrote just a few sentences: “Yesterday when I received your reply, I was extremely elated. I just want to ask you, why do you think it’s impossible for us to be together and want me to not to disturb you anymore? I really can’t stop myself from really liking you. Even though you are very cold to me, I know that you’re actually very kind hearted. Can you please give me a chance? I promise I will forever protect you!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhile writing, I no longer thought of revenge.\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e \u0027Mu Zi’s plain appearance had become so adorable. It couldn’t be that I’d really fallen in love with her? No, it couldn’t be.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e\u0027\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;I silently reminded myself not to forget to execute my revenge on her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter I gave her the letter, she replied on the paper, “Stop asking me! We definitely can’t be together. I will never fall for you! Just give up! Hai Shui is the one who loves you. She should be the one that you choose!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter I finished reading her unkempt words, I focused on her face. She felt my hot gaze and looked at me. I whispered to her, “Please give me a reason?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen I asked that, my heart actually felt a dull ache.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi’s eyes showed a complicated expression and she whispered back, “Just don’t ask, okay?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe didn’t not look as cold, but was actually really delicate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMy heart began trembling. I suddenly reached out to hold her cold, yet tender hand. Once I touched her hand, She screamed out in shock and almost toppled out of her chair.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was the current lesson is with the annoying old mage. “Zhang Gong, what are you doing? It is class time!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI awkwardly laughed, “Teacher, Mu Zi got scared by a cockroach just now so I just went to support her.” Mu Zi’s face flushed, but didn\u0027t say anything. She just looked down at her lapels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old man, finding he did not have any evidence to use against me, angrily shouted, “Please take note of that next time! Students, I will teach up to here as it is nearing the end of the class. We will have a test to test your knowledge on magic spells tomorrow. I hope that every student will come to class prepared for the test to achieve good grades for it. There’s a chance for those who fail to be unable to advance to year four!” After saying that, he glared at me. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘No! This can’t be happening.There’s a test tomorrow? I haven\u0027t been listening much in class, and the classes are short. How am I supposed to take the test on the knowledge of spells? It isn’t the same as a test on usage of magic spells! Damn him! I’ll need to rely on Ma Ke this time.’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI whispered to Mu Zi, “You didn’t hurt yourself, did you? How about we have lunch together today?” Mu Zi did not reply, but took out a paper and wrote on it before throwing it to me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI looked down at the paper. She wrote: “Please stop disturbing me! I am begging you! Now, I am the laughingstock of the class. In the future, please also stop writing letters to me.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen I read her words, my heart coldly shuddered. However, I remembered her reddened face. I knew that she had some feelings for me. Since she refused to join me for lunch, then I would just forget about it. I’ll take it easy for now, but one day I would definitely get her to willingly come into my arms\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-4-chapter-14\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-4-chapter-16\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-4-chapter-15","bookId":1498,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM"}
