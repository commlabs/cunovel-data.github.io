I wanted you to know in case this goes any further.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since we’re being honest here, I should tell you that I’m coming off a relationship and I don’t know how I feel about that yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re afraid of getting involved again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid of getting involved with the wrong woman again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina cupped her chin in her hand and leaned toward me. I cupped my chin in my hand and leaned toward her. We were close enough to kiss. I should have kissed her. I don’t know why I didn’t. Instead, I told her, “I need a favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” She sounded disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to call me the next time Hester comes in. I need to find out about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina pushed herself off the bar. “I can do that. But I also promised I’d call the cops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” I was thinking it was Bobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Policewoman named Jean Something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Know her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m told she’s young, beautiful, and smart as hell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wagged her hand like she wasn’t sure she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to get you into trouble, Nina.” She opened both eyes wide in feigned shock. “I mean with the cops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promised to call when Hester came in. I didn’t promise I wouldn’t call you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t mention it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid off the stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what if she doesn’t come in again?” Nina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’ll call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina smiled bright and beautiful. “What does the telephone company say? ‘Reach out and touch someone’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went home, checked my mail, checked my telephone messages, and made a pot of coffee—hazelnut, ground from fresh beans purchased from the Cameron Coffee Company of Hayward, Wisconsin. While it brewed I stretched out on my sofa, Fleetwood Mac on the CD player singing “Then Play On.” I didn’t know which was more exhausting, my encounter with the Boyz or all that heavy flirting with Nina Truhler. I closed my eyes, which was a mistake. I didn’t open them again until the ringing telephone woke me about an hour later. I debated not answering it, coming up with five, six, seven good reasons to pretend I wasn’t home. Only the challenge of the unknown was too great. After all, it could be Dick Clark and Ed McMahon arranging to give me a cardboard check the size of my mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. McKenzie, I need your help,” a voice told me instead of “Hello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dave Bruder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruder wanted to call the shots. I let him. That was my first mistake. But all I could think about was the look on Bobby’s face when I brought him in—the look on his face and Tommy Thompson’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruder wanted to come in, too—he was tired of running, of hiding. Only he was frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need protection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t East L.A., pal,” I told him. “The St. Paul cops aren’t going to beat on you with sticks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not just them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who else? The Family Boyz?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho could blame him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you calling me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m told you can be trusted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoever gave you that idea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you help me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for maybe, oh, three seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want me to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meet me. Come with me to the police station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you promise not to call the police?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was my second mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later I was sitting at a small table hard against the railing of the third floor food court of the City Center, looking down into the courtyard below. The City Center is a combination shopping mall and office building in downtown Minneapolis. Bruder insisted on meeting in Minneapolis. He figured the cops weren’t looking for him there. I should have set him straight, but I didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him ride the escalator up. He was wearing a Pierre Cardin suit with sharp creases, black wing tips shined to a high gloss, a freshly pressed white cotton dress shirt and a perfectly knotted power tie. His face was clean shaven, his hair neatly parted. I didn’t know where he had been the past week, but he had taken good care of himself. He stopped in the center of the food court and glanced about. I recognized him, but he didn’t know me from the kid at the Orange Julius stand. I gave him a little wave and he came over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Mr. Bruder. Where have you been keeping yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hushed me—“Don’t use my name”—and glanced around nervously before sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously,” I told him. “You look nice. Why is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what I was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t kill my wife,” he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou sure look good for it, I thought but didn’t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t,” Bruder insisted, as if he had read my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone thinks I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you blame them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say if he did or didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Bruder, where’s your son?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-hard-ticket-home-mac-mckenzie-1/page-59.html","bookId":2225,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:26 PM"}
