{"id":103320,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eFive miles away, in a small posting inn, a man sat in his room, alone, with a bottle of expensive French brandy, an empty glass, a very small case of clothing, and a woman\u0027s ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Jack Audley; formerly Captain John Audley of His Majesty\u0027s army; formerly Jack Audley of Butlersbridge, County Cavan, Ireland; formerly Jack Cavendish-Audley of the same place; and formerly - as formerly as one could get, as it was at the time of his christening - John Augustus Cavendish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe miniature had meant nothing to him. He could barely see it in the night, and he\u0027d yet to find a portraitist who could capture a man\u0027s essence on a miniature painting, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the ring...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an unsteady hand, he poured himself another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t looked closely at the ring when he took it from the old lady\u0027s hands. But now, in the privacy of his rented room, he\u0027d looked. And what he\u0027d seen had shaken him to his bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d seen that ring before. On his own finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis was a masculine version, but the design was identical. A twisted flower, a tiny swirled D. He\u0027d never known what it meant, as he\u0027d been told that his father\u0027s name was John Augustus Cavendish, no capital D\u0027s to be found anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still didn\u0027t know what the D stood for, but he knew that the old lady did. And no matter how many times he tried to convince himself that this was just a coincidence, he knew that this evening, on a deserted Lincolnshire road, he\u0027d met his grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the ring again. He\u0027d propped it up on the table, its face winking up at him in the candlelight. Abruptly, he twisted his own ring and yanked it off. He couldn\u0027t remember the last time his finger had been bare. His aunt had always insisted that he keep it close; it was the only keepsake they had of his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother, they told him, had been clutching it in her shivering fingers when she was pulled from the frigid waters of the Irish Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Jack held the ring out, carefully setting it down next to its sister. His lips flattened slightly as he regarded the pair. What had he been thinking? That when he got the two side by side he\u0027d see that they were actually quite different?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d known little of his father. His name, of course, and that he was the younger son of a well-to-do English family. His aunt had met him but twice; her impression had been that he was somewhat estranged from his relations. He spoke of them only laughingly, in that manner people used when they did not wish to say anything of substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t much money, or so his aunt assumed. His clothes were fine, but well-worn, and as far as anyone could tell, he\u0027d been wandering the Irish countryside for months. He\u0027d said he had come to witness the wedding of a school friend and liked it so much that he stayed. His aunt saw no reason to doubt this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, all Jack knew was this: John Augustus Cavendish was a well-born English gentleman who\u0027d traveled to Ireland, fallen in love with Louise Galbraith, married her, and then died when the ship carrying them to England had sunk off the coast of Ireland. Louise had washed ashore, her body bruised and shivering, but alive. It was over a month before anyone realized she was pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was weak, and she was devastated by grief, and her sister - the woman who had raised Jack as her own - said it was more of a surprise that Louise survived the pregnancy than it was that she finally succumbed at his birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that fairly well summed up Jack\u0027s knowledge of his paternal heritage. He thought about his parents from time to time, wondering who they\u0027d been and which had gifted him with his ready smile, but in truth, he\u0027d never yearned for anything more. At the age of two days he\u0027d been given to William and Mary Audley, and if they had ever loved their own children more, they never allowed him to know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had grown up the de facto son of a country squire, with two brothers, a sister, and twenty acres of rolling pasture, perfect for riding, running, jumping - anything a young boy could fancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a marvelous childhood. Damn near perfect. If he was not leading the life he\u0027d anticipated, if he sometimes lay in bed and wondered what the hell he was doing robbing coaches in the dead of night - at least he knew that the road to this point had been paved with his own choices, his own flaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd most of the time, he was happy. He was reasonably cheerful by nature, and really, one could do worse than playing Robin Hood along rural British roads. At least he felt as if he had some sort of purpose. After he and the army had parted ways, he\u0027d not known what to do with himself. He was not willing to return to his life as a soldier, and yet, what else was he qualified to do? He had two skills in life, it seemed: He could sit a horse as if he\u0027d been born in the position, and he could turn a conversation with enough wit and flair to charm even the crustiest of individuals. Put together, robbing coaches had seemed the most logical choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had made his first theft in Liverpool, when he\u0027d seen a young toff kick a one-handed former soldier who\u0027d had the temerity to beg for a penny. Somewhat buoyed by a rather potent pint of ale, Jack had followed the fellow into a dark corner, pointed a gun a his heart, and walked off with his wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe contents of which he had then dispersed among the beggars on Queens Way, most of whom had fought for - and then been forgotten by - the good people of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, ninety per cent of the contents had been dispersed. Jack had to eat, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, it had been an easy step to move to highway robbery. It was so much more elegant than the life of footpad. And it could not be denied that it was much easier to get away on horseback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so that was his life. It was what he did. If he\u0027d gone back to Ireland, he would probably be married by now, sleeping with one woman, in one bed, in one house. His life would be County Cavan, and his world a far, far smaller place than it was today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis was a roaming soul. That was why he did not go back to Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe splashed a bit more brandy into his glass. There were a hundred reasons why he did not go back to Ireland. Fifty, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a sip, then another, then drank deeply until he was too sotted to continue his dishonesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one reason he did not go back to Ireland. One reason, and four people he did not think he could face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising from his seat, he walked to the window and looked out. There wasn\u0027t much to see - a small barn for horses, a thickly leaved tree across the road. The moonlight had turned the air translucent - shimmery and thick, as if a man could step outside and lose himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled grimly. It was tempting. It was always tempting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew where Belgrave Castle was. He\u0027d been in the county for a week; one could not remain in Lincolnshire that long without learning the locations of the grand houses, even if one wasn\u0027t a thief out to rob their inhabitants. He could take a look, he supposed. He probably should take a look. He owed it to someone. Hell, maybe he owed it to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been interested in his father much...but he\u0027d always been interested a little. And he was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knew when he\u0027d be in Lincolnshire again? He was far too fond of his head to ever stay in one place for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to talk to the old lady. He didn\u0027t want to introduce himself and make explanations or pretend that he was anything other than what he was -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA veteran of the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA highwayman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn occasionally sentimental fool who knew that the softhearted ladies who\u0027d tended the wounded had it all wrong - sometimes you couldn\u0027t go home again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut dear Lord, what he wouldn\u0027t give just to take a peek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. His family would welcome him back. That was the worst of it. His aunt would put her arms around him. She would tell him it wasn\u0027t his fault. She would be so understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she would not understand. That was his final thought before he fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd dreamed of Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day dawned bright and mockingly clear. Had it rained, Jack wouldn\u0027t have bothered to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on horseback, and he\u0027d spent enough of his life pretending he didn\u0027t mind that he was soaked to the skin. He did not ride in the rain if he did not have to. He\u0027d earned that much, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was not meant to meet up with his cohorts until nightfall, so he did not have an excuse for not going. Besides, he was just going to look. Maybe see if there was some way he could leave the ring for the old lady. He suspected it meant a great deal to her, and even though he could have probably got a hefty sum for it, he knew he would not be able to bring himself to sell it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he ate a hearty breakfast - accompanied by a noxious beverage the innkeeper swore would clear his head, not that Jack had said anything other than, \"Eggs,\" before the fellow said, \"I\u0027ll get what you need.\" Amazingly, the concoction worked (hence the ability to digest the hearty breakfast), and Jack mounted his horse and took off toward Belgrave Castle at an unhurried pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d ridden about the area frequently over the last few days, but this was the first time he found himself curious at his surroundings. The trees seemed more interesting to him for some reason - the shape of the leaves, the way they showed their backs when the wind blew. The blossoms, too. Some were familiar to him, identical to the ones that bloomed in Ireland. But others were new, perhaps native to the dales and fens of the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd. He wasn\u0027t sure what he was meant to be thinking about. Perhaps that this vista was what his father had seen every time he\u0027d ridden along the same road. Or maybe that, but for a freak storm in the Irish Sea, these might be the flowers and trees of his own childhood. Jack did not know whether his parents would have made their home in England or Ireland. They were apparently going over to introduce his mother to the Cavendish family when their ship had gone down. Aunt Mary had said that they were planning to decide where to live after Louise had a chance to see a bit of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack paused and plucked a leaf off a tree, for no reason other than whimsy. It wasn\u0027t as green as the ones at home, he decided. Not that it mattered, of course, except that in a strange way, it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed the leaf to the ground and with a snort of impatience, took off at a greater speed. It was ludicrous that he felt even a niggle of guilt at going over to see the castle. Good God, it wasn\u0027t as if he was going to introduce himself. He did not want to find a new family. He owed the Audleys far more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just wanted to see it. From afar. To see what might have been, what he was glad hadn\u0027t been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe should have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack took off at a gallop, letting the wind blow the memories away. The speed was cleansing, almost forgiving, and before he knew it he was at the end of the drive. And all he could think was -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d slept the night before, but not much, and not well. And even though the dowager had chosen to spend the morning in bed, Grace had not been afforded that luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager was powerfully demanding, whether vertical, horizontal, or, should she ever figure out how to hold the position, at a slant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so even though she tossed and turned, and refused to lift her head from the pillow, she still managed to summon Grace six times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she had become engrossed in a batch of letters Grace had dug up for her at the bottom of her late husband\u0027s old desk, tucked in a box labeled:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOHN, ETON.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaved by school papers. Who would have thought?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace\u0027s moment of rest was interrupted not twenty minutes later, however, by the arrival of the Ladies Elizabeth and Amelia Willoughby, the pretty, blond daughters of the Earl of Crowland, longtime neighbors and, Grace was always delighted to note, friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth especially. They were of an age, and before Grace\u0027s position in the world had plummeted with the death of her parents, had been considered proper companions. Oh, everyone knew that Grace would not make a match like the Willoughby girls - she would never have a London season, after all. But when they were all in Lincolnshire, they were, if not equals, then at least on something of the same level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople weren\u0027t so fussy at the Dance and Assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the girls were alone, rank was never something they noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was Elizabeth\u0027s younger sister. Just by a year, but when they were all younger, it had seemed a massive gulf, so Grace did not know her nearly so well. That would change soon, though, she supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was betrothed to Thomas, and had been from the cradle. It would have been Elizabeth, except she was promised to another young lord (also in infancy; Lord Crowland was not one to leave matters to chance). Elizabeth\u0027s fellow, however, had died quite young. Lady Crowland (who was not one for tact) had declared it all very inconvenient, but the papers binding Amelia to Thomas had already been signed, and it was deemed best to leave matters as they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had never discussed the engagement with Thomas - they were friends, but he would never talk about something so personal with her. Still, she had long suspected that he found the entire situation rather convenient. A fiancee did keep marriage-minded misses (and their mamas) at bay. Somewhat. It was quite obvious that the ladies of England believed in hedging their bets, and poor Thomas could not go anywhere without the women attempting to put themselves in the best possible light, just in case Amelia should, oh, disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecide she didn\u0027t wish to be a duchess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, Grace thought wryly, as if Amelia had any choice in the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even though a wife would be a far more effective deterrent than a fiancee, Thomas continued to drag his feet, which Grace thought dreadfully insensitive of him. Amelia was one-and-twenty, for heaven\u0027s sake. And according to Lady Crowland, at least four men would have offered for her in London if she had not been marked as the future Duchess of Wyndham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Elizabeth, sister that she was, said it was closer to three, but still, the poor girl had been dangling like a string for years.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Books!\" Elizabeth announced as they entered the hall. \"As promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her behest, Elizabeth\u0027s mother had borrowed several books from the dowager. Not that Lady Crowland actually read the books. Lady Crowland read very little outside the gossip pages, but returning them was a fine pretext to visit Belgrave, and she was always in favor of anything that placed Amelia in the vicinity of Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had the heart to tell her that Amelia rarely even saw Thomas when she was at Belgrave. Most of the time, she was forced to endure the dowager\u0027s company -\u0026nbsp; company, however, being perhaps too generous a word to describe Augusta Cavendish whilst standing before the young lady who was meant to carry on the Wyndham line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager was very good at finding fault. One might even call it her greatest talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Amelia was her favorite subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut today she had been spared. The dowager was still upstairs, reading her dead son\u0027s Latin conjugations, and so Amelia had ended up sipping tea while Grace and Elizabeth chatted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr rather, Elizabeth chatted. It was all Grace could do to nod and murmur in the appropriate moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would think her tired mind would go utterly blank, but the opposite was true. She could not stop thinking about the highwayman. And his kiss. And his identity. And his kiss. And if she would meet him again. And that he\u0027d kissed her. And -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had to stop thinking about him. It was madness. She looked over at the tea tray, wondering if it would be rude to eat the last biscuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - certain you are well, Grace?\" Elizabeth said, reaching forward to clasp her hand. \"You look very tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace blinked, trying to focus on her dear friend\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said reflexively. \"I am quite tired, although that is not an excuse for my inattention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth grimaced. She knew the dowager. They all did. \"Did she keep you up late last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded. \"Yes, although, truthfully, it was not her fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth glanced to the doorway to make sure no one was listening before she replied, \"It is always her fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace smiled wryly. \"No, this time it really wasn\u0027t. We were...\" Well, really, was there any reason not to tell Elizabeth? Thomas already knew, and surely it would be all over the district by nightfall. \"We were accosted by highwaymen, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my heavens! Grace!\" Elizabeth hastily set down her teacup. \"No wonder you appear so distracted!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm?\" Amelia had been staring off into space, as she frequently did while Grace and Elizabeth were nattering on, but this had clearly got her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am quite recovered,\" Grace assured her. \"Just a bit tired, I\u0027m afraid. I did not sleep well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth actually shoved her. \"Grace and the dowager were accosted by highwaymen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded. \"Last night. On the way home from the assembly.\" And then she thought -\u0026nbsp; Good Lord, if the highwayman is really the dowager\u0027s grandson, and he is legitimate, what happens to Amelia?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wasn\u0027t legitimate. He couldn\u0027t be. He might very well be a Cavendish by blood, but surely not by birth. Sons of dukes did not leave legitimate offspring littering the countryside. It simply did not happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they take anything?\" Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be so dispassionate?\" Elizabeth demanded. \"They pointed a gun at her!\" She turned to Grace. \"Did they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace saw it again in her mind - the cold round end of the pistol, the slow, seductive gaze of the highwayman. He wouldn\u0027t have shot her. She knew that now. But still, she murmured, \"They did, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you terrified?\" Elizabeth asked breathlessly. \"I would have been. I would have swooned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have swooned,\" Amelia remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course you wouldn\u0027t,\" Elizabeth said irritably. \"You didn\u0027t even gasp when Grace told you about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds rather exciting, actually.\" Amelia looked at Grace with great interest. \"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Grace - Good heavens, she felt herself blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia leaned forward, her eyes lighting up. \"Was he handsome, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth looked at her sister as if she were mad. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The highwayman, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stammered something and pretended to drink her tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was,\" Amelia said triumphantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was wearing a mask,\" Grace felt compelled to point out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you could still tell that he was handsome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then his accent was terribly romantic. French? Italian?\" Amelia\u0027s eyes grew even wider. \"Spanish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve gone mad,\" Elizabeth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t have an accent,\" Grace retorted. Then she thought of that lilt, that devilish little lift in his voice that she couldn\u0027t quite place. \"Well, not much of one. Scottish, perhaps? Irish? I couldn\u0027t tell, precisely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia sat back with a happy sigh. \"A highwayman. How romantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amelia Willoughby!\" Elizabeth scolded. \"Grace was just attacked at gunpoint, and you are calling it romantic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia opened her mouth to reply, but just then they heard footsteps in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dowager?\" Elizabeth whispered to Grace, looking very much as if she\u0027d like to be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Grace replied. \"She was still abed when I came down. She was rather...ehrm...distraught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should think so,\" Elizabeth remarked. Then she gasped. \"Did they make away with her emeralds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace shook her head. \"We hid them. Under the seat cushions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, how clever!\" Elizabeth said approvingly. \"Amelia, wouldn\u0027t you agree?\" Without waiting for an answer, she turned back to Grace. \"It was your idea, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace opened her mouth to retort that she would have happily handed them over, but just then Thomas walked past the open doorway to the sitting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation stopped. Elizabeth looked at Grace, and Grace looked at Amelia, and Amelia just kept looking at the now empty doorway. After a moment of held breath, Elizabeth turned to Amelia and said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he does not realize we are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" Amelia declared, and Grace believed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder where he went,\" Grace murmured, although she did not think anyone heard her. They were all still watching the doorway, waiting to see if he\u0027d return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a grunt, and then a crash. Grace stood, wondering if she ought to go investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody hell,\" she heard Thomas snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace winced, glancing over at the others. They had risen to their feet as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful with that,\" she heard Thomas say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as the three ladies watched in silence, the painting of John Cavendish moved past the open doorway, two footmen struggling to keep it upright and balanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that?\" Amelia asked once the portrait had gone by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dowager\u0027s middle son,\" Grace murmured. \"He died twenty-nine years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are they moving the portrait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dowager wants it upstairs,\" Grace replied, thinking that ought to be answer enough. Who knew why the dowager did anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was apparently satisfied with this explanation, because she did not question her further. Or it could have been that Thomas chose that moment to reappear in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all three bobbed curtsies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded in that way of his, when he was clearly being nothing but polite. \"Pardon.\" And then he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Elizabeth said, and Grace wasn\u0027t certain whether she was trying to express outrage at his rudeness or simply fill the silence. If it was the latter, it didn\u0027t work, because no one said anything more until Elizabeth finally added, \"Perhaps we should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you can\u0027t,\" Grace replied, feeling dreadful for having to be the bearer of such bad news. \"Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager wants to see Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Grace said. And meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia sat down, looked at the tea tray and announced, \"I\u0027m eating the last biscuit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded. Amelia would need sustenance for the ordeal ahead. \"Perhaps I should order more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Thomas returned again. \"We nearly lost it on the stairs,\" he said to Grace, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole thing swung to the right and nearly impaled itself on the railing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have been a stake through the heart,\" he said with grim humor. \"It would have been worth it just to see her face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace prepared to rise and make her way upstairs. If the dowager was awake, that meant her visit with the Willoughby sisters was over. \"Your grandmother rose from bed, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only to oversee the transfer. You\u0027re safe for now.\" He shook his head, rolling his eyes as he did so. \"I cannot believe she had the temerity to demand that you fetch it for her last night. Or,\" he added quite pointedly, \"that you actually thought you could do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace thought she ought to explain. \"The dowager requested that I bring her the painting last night,\" she told Elizabeth and Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was huge!\" Elizabeth exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandmother always favored her middle son,\" Thomas said, with a twist of his lips that Grace would not have called a smile. He glanced across the room, and then, as if suddenly realizing his future bride was present, said, \"Lady Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grace,\" she responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn\u0027t possibly have heard her. He was already back to Grace, saying, \"You will of course support me if I lock her up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thom - \" Grace began, cutting herself off at the last moment. She supposed that Elizabeth and Amelia knew that he had given her leave to use his given name while at Belgrave, but still, it seemed disrespectful to do so when others were present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grace,\" she said, enunciating each word with careful resolve. \"You must grant her extra patience this day. She is distraught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace sent up a prayer for forgiveness as she let everyone think the dowager had been upset by nothing more than an ordinary robbery. She wasn\u0027t precisely lying to Thomas, but she suspected that in this case the sin of omission could prove equally dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made herself smile. It felt forced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amelia? Are you unwell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace turned. Elizabeth was watching her sister with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m perfectly fine,\" Amelia snapped, which was enough, of course, to show that she was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair bickered for a moment, their voices low enough so Grace could not make out their exact words, and then Amelia rose, saying something about needing some air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas stood, of course, and Grace rose to her feet as well. Amelia passed by and even reached the doorway before Grace realized that Thomas did not intend to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood heavens, for a duke, his manners were abominable. Grace elbowed him in the ribs. Someone had to, she told herself. No one ever stood up to the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas shot her a dirty look, but he obviously realized that she was in the right, because he turned to Amelia, nodded his head the barest of inches, and said, \"Allow me to escort you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey departed, and Grace and Elizabeth sat silently for at least a minute before Elizabeth said resignedly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not a good match, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace glanced at the door, even though they had long since departed. She shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was huge. It was a castle, of course, and meant to be imposing, but really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stood, open-mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny how no one had mentioned that his father was from a ducal family. Had anyone even known? He had always assumed his father had been the son of some jolly old country squire, maybe a baronet or possibly a baron. He had always been told that he was sired by John Cavendish, not Lord John Cavendish, as he must have been styled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as for the old lady...Jack had realized that morning that she had never given her name, but surely she was the duchess. She was far too imperious to be a maiden aunt or widowed relation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood Lord. He was the grandson of a duke. How was that possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stared at the structure before him. He was not a complete provincial. He\u0027d traveled widely whilst in the army and had gone to school with the sons of Ireland\u0027s most notable families. The aristocracy was not unknown to him. He did not consider himself uncomfortable in their midst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many rooms in the place? There had to be over a hundred. And what was the provenance? It didn\u0027t look quite medieval, despite the crenellations at the top, but it was certainly pre-Tudor. Something important must have happened there. Houses did not get this big without stumbling into the occasional historic event. A treaty, maybe? Perhaps a royal visit? It sounded like the sort of thing that would have been mentioned in school, which was probably why he didn\u0027t know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scholar he was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe view of the castle as he\u0027d approached had been deceptive. The area was heavy with trees, and the turrets and towers seemed to twinkle in and out of sight as he moved through the foliage. It was only when he reached the end of the drive that it had come completely into view - massive and amazing. The stone was gray in color, with a hint of a yellow undertone, and although its angles were mostly squared off, there was nothing boring about the facade. It dipped and rose, jutted out and swept back in. No long Georgian wall of windows was this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack couldn\u0027t even imagine how long it would take a newcomer to find his way around inside. Or how long it would take to find the poor fellow once he got himself lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he stood and stared, trying to take it in. What would it have been like to grow up there? His father had done so, and by all accounts he\u0027d been a nice enough fellow. Well, by one account, he supposed - his Aunt Mary was the only person he knew who\u0027d known his father well enough to pass along a story or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it was difficult to imagine a family living there. His own home in Ireland had not been small by any standards, but still, with four children it often felt as if they were constantly crashing into one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou couldn\u0027t go ten minutes or even ten steps without being swept into a conversation with a cousin or a brother or an aunt or even a dog. (He\u0027d been a good dog, God rest his furry little soul. Better than most people.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had known each other, the Audleys. It was, Jack had long since decided, a very good - and very uncommon - thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes there was a small flurry of movement at the front door, then three women emerged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo were blond. It was too far away to see their faces, but he could tell by the way they moved that they were young, and probably quite pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty girls, he\u0027d long since learned, moved differently than the plain ones. It did not matter if they were aware of their beauty or not. What they weren\u0027t was aware of their plainness. Which the plain ones always were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack quirked a half smile. He supposed he was a bit of a scholar of women. Which, he\u0027d often tried to convince himself, was as noble a subject as any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was the third girl - the last to emerge from the castle - who captured his breath and held him motionless, unable to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the girl from the carriage the night before. He was sure of it. The hair was the right color - shiny and dark, but it wasn\u0027t such a unique shade that it couldn\u0027t be found elsewhere. He knew it was her because...because...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered her. He remembered the way she moved, the way she felt pressed up against him. He remembered the soft breath of the air between their bodies when she\u0027d moved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d liked her. He didn\u0027t often get the chance to like or dislike the people he waylaid, but he\u0027d been thinking to himself that there was something rather appealing about the flash of intelligence in her eyes when the old lady had shoved her at him, giving him permission to hold a gun to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d not approved of that. But he\u0027d appreciated it all the same, because touching her, holding her - it had been an unexpected pleasure. And when the old lady returned with the miniature, his only thought had been that it was a pity he didn\u0027t have time to kiss her properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack held himself quietly as he watched her move in the drive, glancing over her shoulder, then leaning forward to say something to the other girls. One of the blondes linked arms with her and led her off to the side. They were friends, he realized with surprise, and he wondered if the girl - his girl, as he was now thinking of her - was something more than a companion. A poor relation, maybe? She was certainly not a daughter of the house, but it seemed she was not quite a servant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe adjusted the straps of her bonnet, and then she (What was her name? He wanted to know her name) pointed to something in the distance. Jack found himself glancing the same way, but there were too many trees framing the drive for him to see whatever had captured her interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not cry out, nor did she flinch, but he knew that she saw him in the way she...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the way she simply was, he supposed, because he could not see her face from such a distance. But he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin began to prickle with awareness, and it occurred to him that she\u0027d recognized him, too. It was preposterous, because he was all the way down the drive, and not wearing his highwayman\u0027s garb, but he knew that she knew she was staring at the man who had kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment - it could only have lasted seconds - stretched into eternity. And then somewhere behind him a bird cawed, snapping him from his trance, and one thought pounded through his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never stayed in one spot for long, but here - this place - it was surely the most dangerous of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave it one last look. Not of longing; he did not long for this. And as for the girl from the carriage - he fought down something strange and acrid, burning in his throat - he would not long for her, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things were simply untenable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace heard Elizabeth speak, but she pretended not to. They were sitting in the Willoughbys\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfortable carriage, but their happy threesome now numbered four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager had, upon rising from her bed, taken one look at Amelia\u0027s sun-kissed cheeks (Grace did think that she and Thomas had taken quite a long walk together, all things considered), and gone into a barely intelligible tirade about the proper decorum of a future duchess. It was not every day one heard a speech containing dynasty, procreation, and sunspots - all in one sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dowager had managed it, and now they were all miserable, Amelia most of all. The dowager had got it into her head that she needed to speak with Lady Crowland - most probably about the supposed blemishes on Amelia\u0027s skin - and so she invited herself along for the ride, giving instructions to the Wyndham stables to ready a carriage and send it after them for the return journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had come along, too. Because, quite frankly, she didn\u0027t have any choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace?\" It was Elizabeth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace sucked in her lips and positively glued her eyes to a spot on the seat cushion just to the left of the dowager\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was it?\" Elizabeth persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one,\" Grace said quickly. \"Are we ready to depart?\" She looked out the window, pretending to wonder why they were delayed on the drive. Any moment now they would leave for Burges Park, where the Willoughbys lived. She had been dreading the journey, short though it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she\u0027d seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highwayman. Whose name wasn\u0027t Cavendish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had left before the dowager emerged from the castle, turning his mount in a display of horsemanship so expert that even she, who was no equestrienne, recognized his skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had seen her. And he had recognized her. She was certain of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d felt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace tapped her fingers impatiently against the side of her thigh. She thought of Thomas, and of the enormous portrait that had passed by the doorway of the sitting room. She thought of Amelia, who had been raised since birth to be the bride of a duke. And she thought of herself. Her world might not be quite what she wanted, but it was hers, and it was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne man had the power to send it all crashing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was why, even though she would have traded a corner of her soul for just one more kiss from a man whose name she did not know, when Elizabeth remarked that it looked as if she knew him, she said, sharply, \"I do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager looked up, her face pinched with irritation. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a man at the end of the drive,\" Elizabeth said, before Grace could deny anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager\u0027s head snapped back in Grace\u0027s direction. \"Who was it?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I could not see his face.\" Which wasn\u0027t a lie.
