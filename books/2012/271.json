And for that I truly grieve.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you going somewhere to die?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do not weep, friend. I do not know what awaits me.’ He stepped close to Ublala. ‘I have left you sufficient food and water for a week’s travel. Beyond that, well.’ He shrugged, and then held out a hand. ‘Now, let us clasp arms.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Ublala wrapped the god in a fierce hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Draconus pulled himself free. ‘You give reason, friend, for what I must attempt. If sorcery must die, the magic in the mortal soul will persevere – or so I choose to believe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalata hissed, ‘Kill him, Ublala! Kill him now – you can do it! Snap his neck! Take that sword!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala winced and then shrugged. ‘She’s always going on like this. She don’t mean anything by it, Draconus. Honest.’ He wiped at his eyes. ‘Goodbye. I’ll never see you again.’ And this time he burst into tears, wailing with his hands over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ralata rushed to him, scrabbling to draw his knife, Ublala batted her away between sobs. She was thrown back, sailing through the air and then landing hard, limbs flailing, before falling still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Draconus walked over. Crouched down. ‘Unconscious. Well, that is something, I suppose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSniffling, Ublala said, ‘Women always get jealous about man friends. Sometimes they say bad things about them. Sometimes they try to knife them. Sometimes they sex them. Sometimes they run away with them. Sometimes they get so mad they just up and die. But it’s all just stupid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraconus straightened, walked a short distance away, and then turned to face Ublala one more time. ‘Be well, Ublala Pung.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t die, Draconus.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe god smiled. ‘I shall try not to.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala watched his friend disappear inside a bloom of black, ethereal darkness, watched as the darkness found shape – spreading wings, a long serpent neck, a massive head with rows of scimitar-length fangs, eyes of lurid yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon lifted into the sky, the vast wings hissing with the sound of cold water on hot stones as the creature wheeled and set off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an uneven sigh, the Teblor collected the pack containing the food, and then the heavy waterskins. Along with his weapons and armour, the burden was enough to make him grunt when he straightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrasping Ralata by one ankle, he began walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way she was right now, why, a wife was as bad as a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Diligence arrived well ahead of the retinue, his boots echoing as he strode the length of the throne room. All the blood stains remained – splashed and smeared across the marble tiles, along the pillars to either side and the walls behind them, and upon the throne itself, where sat Sister Reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRestitution had begun here, in this very chamber, and it was proper to remind all who would enter. Halting before Reverence – the only other person present – he said, ‘We must assume that they are lost to us, Sister.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I smell smoke, Brother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excellent.’ She paused and then said, ‘“Lost.” Now that is a curious word. Are they dead, or are they now treasonous to our great cause?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If the former, Sister, we must then reconsider the enemies arrayed against us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if the latter, then we must re-evaluate the loyalty among us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The issue lies with Sister Calm,’ said Brother Diligence. ‘Equity but follows.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not precisely true, Brother. Equity is the heart of the ideals which they would hold, but it is Calm who adheres to the practical. Her long imprisonment, horrific as it must have been, has greatly damaged her spirit, I am afraid. We must, indeed, hope that she is dead, more so than poor, misguided Equity.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have received a missive from the siege, Sister. The assault failed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverence sat straighter. ‘But how can this be?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sister Belie informs me that Akhrast Korvalain is ineffectual against the commander of the besieged.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Impossible – unless, is he a god? An ascendant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Neither, I am told. This man – a mortal – titles himself the Master of the Deck of Dragons. He commands the warrens, in ways Sister Belie cannot quite understand. But what she describes at last explains the sudden appearance of that army. They arrived via a portal, travelling by warren. Incidentally, this is why they could not get closer to us here at the Spire, where our sorcerous influence is strongest.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-271.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
