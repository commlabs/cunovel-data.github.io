The weightlessness, peace, and privacy of the space-float gave place to something that had neither peace nor privacy. Even the weightlessness, which continued, became more a purgatory than a paradise under the new conditions. Try to manipulate an ordinarily non-portable heat projector. It could be lifted despite the fact that it was six feet high and wide and almost solid metal, since it weighed only a fraction of an ounce. But its inertia was exactly what it had always been, which meant that if it wasn\u0027t moved into position very slowly, it would just keep on going, taking you with it. Then you would have to hike the pseudo-grav field of your suit and come down with a jar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeralski had hiked the field a little too high and he came down a little too roughly, with the projector coming down with him at a dangerous angle. His crushed ankle had been the first casualty of the expedition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz was swearing fluently and nearly continuously. He continued to have the impulse to drag the back of his hand across his forehead in order to wipe away the accumulating sweat. The few times that he had succumbed to the impulse, metal had met silicone with a clash that rang loudly inside his suit, but served no useful purpose. The desiccators within the suit were sucking at maximum and, of course, recovering the water and restoring ion-exchanged liquid, containing a careful proportion of salt, into the appropriate receptacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz yelled, \"Damn it, Dick, wait till I give the word, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Swenson\u0027s voice rang in his ears, \"Well, how long am I supposed to sit here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Till I say,\" replied Rioz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strengthened pseudo-grav and lifted the projector a bit. He released pseudo-grav, insuring that the projector would stay in place for minutes even if he withdrew support altogether. He kicked the cable out of the way (it stretched beyond the close \"horizon\" to a power source that was out of sight) and touched the release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe material of which the fragment was composed bubbled and vanished under its touch. A section of the lip of the tremendous cavity he had already carved into its substance melted away and a roughness in its contour had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try it now,\" called Rioz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson was in the ship that was hovering nearly over Rioz\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson called, \"All clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a feeble flicker of steam that issued from one of the ship\u0027s forward vents. The ship drifted down toward the ring fragment. Another flicker adjusted a tendency to drift sidewise. It came down straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third flicker to the rear slowed it to a feather rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz watched tensely. \"Keep her coming. You\u0027ll make it. You\u0027ll make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rear of the ship entered the hole, nearly filling it. The bellying walls came closer and closer to its rim. There was a grinding vibration as the ship\u0027s motion halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Swenson\u0027s turn to curse. \"It doesn\u0027t fit,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz threw the projector groundward in a passion and went flailing up into space. The projector kicked up a white crystalline dust all about it, and when Rioz came down under pseudo-grav, he did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You went in on the bias, you dump Grounder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hit it level, you dirt-eating farmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackward-pointing side jets of the ship were blasting more strongly than before, and Rioz hopped to get out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship scraped up from the pit, then shot into space half a mile before forward jets could bring it to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson said tensely, \"We\u0027ll spring half a dozen plates if we do this once again. Get it right, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"II get it right. Don\u0027t worry about it. Just you come in right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz lumped upward and allowed himself to climb three hundred yards to get an over-all look at the cavity. The gouge marks of the ship were plain enough. They were concentrated at one point halfway down the pit. He would get that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began to melt outward under the blaze of the projector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later the ship snuggled neatly into its cavity, and Swenson, wearing his space suit, emerged to join Rioz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson said, \"If you want to step in and climb out of the suit, I\u0027ll take care of the icing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" said Rioz. \"I\u0027d just as soon sit here and watch Saturn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down at the lip of the pit. There was a six-foot gap between it and the ship. In some places about the circle, it was two feet; in a few places, even merely a matter of inches. You couldn\u0027t expect a better fit out of handwork. The final adjustment would be made by steaming ice gently and letting it freeze into the cavity between the lip and the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturn moved visibly across the sky, its vast bulk inching below the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said, \"How many ships are left to put in place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson said, \"Last I heard, it was eleven. We\u0027re in now, so that means only ten. Seven of the ones that are placed are iced in. Two or three are dismantled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re coming alone fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s plenty to do yet. Don\u0027t forget the main jets at the other end. And the cables and the power lines. Sometimes I wonder if we\u0027ll make it. On the way out, it didn\u0027t bother me so much, but just now I was sitting at the controls and I was saying, \u0027We won\u0027t make it. Well sit out here and starve and die with nothing but Saturn over us.\u0027 It makes me feel-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t explain how it made him feel. He just sat there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said, \"You think too damn much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s different with you,\" said Swenson. \"I keep thinking of Pete-and Dora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for? She said you could go, didn\u0027t she? The Commissioner gave her that talk on patriotism and how you\u0027d be a hero and set for life once you got back, and she said you could go. You didn\u0027t sneak out the way Adams did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adams is different. That wife of his should have been shot when she was born. Some women can make hell for a guy, can\u0027t they? She didn\u0027t want him to go-but she\u0027d probably rather he didn\u0027t come back if she can get his settlement pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your kick, then? Dora wants you back, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson sighed. \"I never treated her right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You turned over your pay, it seems to me. I wouldn\u0027t do that for any woman. Money for value received, not a cent more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money isn\u0027t it. I get to thinking out here. A woman likes company. A kid needs his father. What am I doing way out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting set to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-h, you don\u0027t understand.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-7.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
