In every Divine Kingdom, there were only several dozen Destiny Decree characters and most of them were in long term seclusion.

The skeletal man smiled, revealing a blood red tongue and bone white teeth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was just a single look but Rong Lin was filled with fear and terror.

I told you to retreat, so retreat! That fellow above us is a Destiny Decree master!” Rong Lin originally didn’t want to reveal the status of Corpsemancer, but as he saw that the young martial artist wasn’t convinced, and even had an eager look to butt his way in, he had no choice but to announce a bit of Corpsemancer’s information.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“De-de-de-Destiny Decree!?” The young martial artist was not an idiot. In fact, upon hearing the name of the famous Destiny Decree, everyone was shaken to their cores. They were all well aware just what that implied.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is there a mistake?

He’s obviously just a 20 some year old youth, and his cultivation… his cultivation is… at the late Revolving Core realm!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes, he is only at the late Revolving Core realm and his opponent is Corpsemancer. That young man is insane!” Rong Lin’s eyes blazed as he looked at Lin Ming. As captain of the city guard he naturally had an understanding toward all the top level characters of the four Divine Kingdoms. However, he couldn’t recall the slightest bit of information about Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt wasn’t just the city guard, but all observing martial artists discovered that the difference in cultivation of the two flying in the air was simply too great.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is this a life or death battle, or a senior advising a junior?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He’s definitely directing him.

It’s probable that he hasn’t heard the fame of the Destiny Decree yet, thus he rashly acted. Young miss, this is our only chance. If we continue watching the battle from here then it’s the same as waiting to die.” Grandma White anxiously said. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming really were a junior of the four Divine Kingdoms then it would be impossible that someone with a talent as monstrous and unprecedented as his could remain obscure.

I have already accepted my fate. I would rather stay here and watch Young Hero Lin’s battle. Perhaps, there is even a small glimmer of hope that Young Hero Lin can create an opening for us. At that time we’ll attack together, and even if we can’t win, we can still die an honorable death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright…” Grandma White shook her head, no longer attempting to convince Xiaoxiao.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, more and more martial artists began filling the skies.

Most of those martial artists floating in the air and watching the scene weren’t masters. They hadn’t yet been able to figure out just how Lin Ming’s strength contrasted with Corpsemancer, but now as Lin Ming’s force field enveloped the entire battlefield, all of them became nothing more than leaves in a storm, scattering or collapsing in all directions! The slightly weaker martial artists, even if they were an entire mile away from Lin Ming, still vomited out a mouthful of blood as they were severely injured!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is that!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the martial artists were dumbfounded.

Force field abilities were exceedingly rare; even a supremely talented junior of the four Divine Kingdoms wouldn’t necessarily have one.
