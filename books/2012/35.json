No, I do not like our two children .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth took a moment to gather her thoughts. ‘The Adjudicators had risen to power first in Kolanse,’ she said after a time. She didn’t want to remember them, didn’t want to think about any of that, but she forced herself to continue. ‘When we first heard of them, in our camps, the stories came from caravan guards and traders. They spoke nervously, with fear in their eyes. “Not human,” they said. They were priests. Their cult was founded on the Spire, which is a promontory in the bay of Kolanse, and it was there that they first settled, building a temple and then a fortress.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So they were foreigners?’ Gesler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. From somewhere called the Wretched Coast. All I have heard of this is second-hand. They arrived in ships of bone. The Spire was unoccupied – who would choose to live on cursed land? And to begin with there was but one ship, crewed by slaves, and twelve or thirteen priests and priestesses. Hardly an invasion, as far as the king of Kolanse was concerned. And when they sent an emissary to his court, he welcomed her. The native priesthoods were not as pleased and they warned their king, but he overruled them. The audience was granted. The Adjudicator was arrogant. She spoke of justice as if her people alone were its iron hand. Indeed, that emissary pointed a finger upon the king himself and pronounced his fall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I bet he wasn’t so pleased any more,’ Stormy said with a grunt. ‘He lopped the fool’s head off, I hope.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He tried,’ Kalyth replied. ‘Soldiers and then sorcery – the throne room became a slaughterhouse, and when the battle was over she alone strode out from the palace. And in the harbour were a hundred more ships of bone. This is how the horror began.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler twisted in his saddle and seemed to study the two children for a moment, before facing forward again. ‘Destriant, how long ago was this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. ‘Fifty, sixty years ago. The Adjudicators scoured out all the other priesthoods. More and more of their own followers arrived, season after season. The Watered, they were called. Those with human blood in them. Those first twelve or so, they were the Pures. From Estobanse Province – the richest land of Kolanse – they spread their power outward, enforcing their will. They were not interested in waging war upon the common people, and by voice alone they could make entire armies kneel. From Kolanse they began toppling one dynasty after another – in all the south kingdoms, those girdling the Pelasiar Sea, until all the lands were under their control.’ She shuddered. ‘They were cruel masters. There was drought. Starvation. They called it the Age of Justice, and left the people to die. Those who objected they executed, those who sought to rise against them, they annihilated. Before long, they reached the lands of my people. They crushed us like fleas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ges,’ said Stormy after a time, ‘if not human, then what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kalyth, are these Adjudicators tusked?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tusked? No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Describe them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They are tall, gaunt. Their skin is white as alabaster, and their limbs do not move as do those of humans. From their elbows, they can bend their lower arms in all directions. It is said their bodies are hinged, as if they had two sets of hips, one stacked atop the other. And they can stand like us, or with legs like those of a horse. No weapon can reach them, and a single touch from their long fingers can shatter all the bones in a warrior’s body. Sorcerous attacks drain down from them like water.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is it the same for the Watered,’ Gesler wanted to know, ‘or just the Pures?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Have you seen one of these Adjudicators with your own eyes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, and then shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But your tribe—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We heard they were coming. We knew they would kill us all. I ran.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hood’s breath!’ barked Stormy. ‘So you don’t know if they ever—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I snuck back, days later, Shield Anvil.’ She had to force the words out, her mouth dry as dust, her thoughts cold as a corpse. ‘They were thorough.’ I snuck back. But is that even true? Or did I just dream that? The broken faces of my children, so still. My husband, his spine twisted impossibly, his eyes staring. The dead dogs, the shamans’ heads on poles. And the blood, everywhere – even my tears … ‘I ran. I am the last of my people.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This drought you mentioned,’ Gesler said, ‘had it struck before these Adjudicators arrived, or after?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-35.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
