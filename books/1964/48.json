You could have lied to me about your feelings, but you haven’t and I’m grateful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t trust Tony,” she said, “but I trust you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might not trust him, but you want to believe him, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I don’t know. It doesn’t matter if I do, does it? I’ve already agreed to marry you, and I’m not backing out.” She refused to do to Chase what Tony had done to her. She wouldn’t push him aside in favor of Tony’s promises. Chase was right; Tony had always been a sore loser, no matter what the stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase said nothing for several minutes. “The choice is yours,” he finally said, “and I’ll abide by whatever you decide. I want you, Lesley. Don’t misunderstand me. I’m surprised by how much I desire you. If you agree to marry me, I promise you I’ll do my best to be a good husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make it sound like I haven’t made up my mind. I’ve already told you—and Tony—that I have. I’m going through with the wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t too late to call it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I do that?” she asked, forcing a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you’re in love with Tony,” Chase answered with dark, sober eyes focused on her. “Think about this very carefully,” he advised and walked to her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re leaving?” She was afraid Tony would return and she didn’t know what she’d do if Chase wasn’t there to buffer his effect on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you call me in the morning?” he asked. He didn’t need to explain what he expected to hear. That was obvious. If she was willing to go through with the ceremony, she needed to let him know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can tell you that right now,” she said, folding her hands in an effort to keep from reaching for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might feel differently later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t. I promise you I won’t.” The desperate quality of her voice was all the answer he seemed to need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came over to her, placed his hands on her shoulders and drew her into his arms. “I shouldn’t touch you, but I can’t make myself leave without kissing you goodbye. Forgive me for that, Lesley.” His last words were whispered as he lowered his mouth to hers. The kiss was filled with a longing and a hunger that left her breathless and yearning for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe expelled his breath, then turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley watched him go and had the feeling she might never see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees were trembling and she sank onto the sofa and hid her face in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d lost her, Chase told himself as he unlocked the door to his hotel suite. He could’ve taken the advantage and run with it. At first he thought he’d do exactly that. Tony wasn’t right for Lesley—anyone could see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, he believed it so strongly because he wanted her for himself. Maybe the jerk was good for Lesley, although Chase couldn’t see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase suspected Tony would string her along for years. He’d promise to divorce April but there’d be complications. There were always complications in cases like this, and Lesley would be completely disheartened by the time Tony was free. If he ever followed through on his promises. Chase knew exactly whose interests Tony was serving, and those were his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony might have some genuine affection for Lesley, but he didn’t really love her. He couldn’t possibly, otherwise he’d never put her through this agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, Chase’s own intentions weren’t exactly pure, either. He needed a wife and he wanted Lesley. It didn’t matter to him that she was in love with another man; all that mattered was her willingness to marry him and live with him in Alaska.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was a law against selfishness, he’d be swinging by his neck, right next to Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he’d done the only thing he could and still live with himself in the weeks to come. This business of being honorable was hard, much harder than he’d realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d given Lesley both the freedom and the privacy to make whatever choice she wanted. He wouldn’t stand in her way, judge or condemn her if she decided not to go through with their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to lose the wife he wanted, and nobility didn’t offer much compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he had to do was wait until she’d made up her mind. He had the distinct feeling that this was going to be a long night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It shouldn’t be this hard,” Lesley wailed to her no-nonsense neighbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right. It shouldn’t,” Daisy agreed. She stood next to Lesley’s refrigerator, one hand on her hip. “Look at it this way. You could let Chase go back to Alaska alone and spend the next year or two being lied to, manipulated and emotionally abused by a jerk. Or,” she added with a lazy smile, “you could marry a terrific man who adores you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase doesn’t adore me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not, but he is crazy about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not even sure that’s true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t you got eyes in your head?” Daisy asked sarcastically. “He chose you out of hundreds of women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, if you want to argue with someone, let me bring in the boys. They’re much better at it than either of us. I don’t have time to play silly games with you. I’m calling this the way I see it. If you want to mess up your life, that’s your choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t,” Lesley insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why don’t you phone Chase? You said he was waiting to hear from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there always going to be a but with you?” Daisy demanded impatiently. “Now, call the man before I get really mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Lesley reached for the phone. She prayed she was doing the right thing. After wrestling all night with the decision, she got up and tearfully called Daisy, sobbing out her sorry tale. Daisy, who was already late for her classes, had listened intently. She seemed to know exactly what Lesley should do. She made it all sound so straightforward, so easy. It should’ve been, but it wasn’t, even now with the phone pressed to her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase, it’s Lesley. I’m sorry to phone so early, but I thought you’d want to know as soon as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight hesitation before he spoke. “It would simplify matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…want to go through with the marriage this evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to ask. Why couldn’t he just have left it alone? “Yes, I’m sure.” Her voice shook as if she was on the verge of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy took the receiver from her hand. “She knows what she’s doing, Chase. Now don’t you worry, I’ll have her to the church on time.” Whatever Chase said made Daisy laugh. After a couple of minutes, she replaced the receiver. “You going to make it through the day without changing your mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…don’t have any choice, do I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None. If you stand that man up at the altar, I’m going to murder you and marry him myself. The boys would be thrilled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley laughed. “All right. I’ll see you back here at four. Don’t be late, Daisy, I’m going to need all the support I can get.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if Tony calls you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He probably will, but fortunately I don’t plan on being here. I’ve got a million things to do and I don’t intend to waste a single moment on Tony Field.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Daisy beamed her a bright smile and was out the door a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing nervous came as a surprise to Chase. He’d expected to stand before the preacher he’d hired and repeat his vows without a qualm. He had no doubts, no regrets about making Lesley his bride. Just nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she and her close friends, including Daisy and sons, arrived at the hotel for the simple wedding ceremony, Chase hadn’t been able to take his eyes off her. He’d never seen a more beautiful woman. He’d rented a tuxedo, although what had prompted that was beyond his comprehension. The tie felt like it was strangling him and the cummerbund reminded him of the time he’d broken his ribs. He knew Lesley would be pleased, though, and when she smiled at him, he was glad he’d made the effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d chosen a soft peach dress, overlaid with white lace. She didn’t wear a veil but a pretty pearl headpiece with white silk flowers. The bouquet of white baby roses was clutched in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley had tried to call her mother and stepfather, wherever they were, but their cell phone wasn’t on. Apparently that was typical. Chase reassured her again that they’d tell them later, perhaps arrange to see them in the fall. He, too, was without family—he’d told her only that his parents had died, nothing more—so their guests were mostly Lesley’s friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all rather informal. She introduced Chase to Lori and Jo Ann and a number of others, and he shook hands with each one. Minutes later, it was time for the ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood with everyone gathered around them in the middle of the room. The minister said a few words about marriage and its significance, then asked them to repeat their vows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that moment that Chase fully comprehended what was happening between Lesley and him. He pledged before God that he would love Lesley and meet her needs, both physical and emotional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe responsibility weighed on his mind. He’d given Lesley time to weigh the decision before agreeing to be his bride, never dreaming he needed to think about it, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Lesley as she said her vows. Her steady gaze met his and her voice was strong and clear, without hesitation. When it came time, he slipped the gold band on her finger. He noticed tears brightening her eyes, but her smile reassured him. He could only hope these were tears of joy and not regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he received permission to kiss his bride, Chase gently took her in his arms and kissed her. With everyone watching them, he made sure it was a short but intense kiss. A kiss that went on longer than he’d planned…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley’s eyes were laughing when they broke apart. “You’ll pay for that later, Chase Goodman,” she promised in a fervent whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase could hardly wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was enough food to feed twice as many people as their fifty or so guests. He wasn’t sure how many would be there, so he’d had the hotel staff handle everything. Lesley had given him the names of her friends and he’d invited several people, as well, including Sandra and her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky Bright was there, along with her cameraman. Lesley was wonderful during the interview, answering Becky’s questions without a hint of nervousness. He suspected it was because of her training as a teacher. Personally he was grateful she’d dealt with the reporter because he was at a loss for words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d considered the ceremony itself a mere formality, something that was necessary, a legal requirement, and that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he wasn’t so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vows had gotten to him. He hadn’t truly taken the seriousness of his commitment to heart until he realized that these promises were more, much more, than a few mumbled words. They were vows, a soul-deep contract made between Lesley and himself. A contract that affected every single part of his life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-48.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
