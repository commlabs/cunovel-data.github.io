The building’s location wasn’t a secret and was marked on all the maps in the city. As the Umbrella Corporation was on of the very largest companies in the world, practically everyone in the world had heard of it. Finding this landmark-like construction wasn’t of difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eAt one of the locations a missile exploded not far from the building, based on the insane rate of multiplication and corruption of the virus, it wouldn’t take more than two hours to reach the building. Of course, this was just for the virus. How about if the infected monsters made their way in this direction? Not only were they strong, but they were virus carriers as well...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Damn!

With a bang, the three headed monster with only an eye and mouth on its head was smashed into the ground. It sunk half a metre into the ground. Of course, to this monster over two and a half metre in height, it just needed but a step to get out. However, the totem pole carried enormous force, and one of its heads directly blew apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThis was a team near the Umbrella Corporation\u0027s building. They consisted of mostly blacks. It seemed that the geographical locale they were from was most likely Africa. The black man in the lead had muscles that had all swelled up, and had reached a height of 2.3 or 2.4m. Compared to the strange monster, apart from lacking horizontally, his stature was almost the same. With a giant metal totem pole in his hand, even a tap or brush would break bones or cause internal injuries, let alone an actual strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“This must be a plot change! It’s not like we’ve only experienced this sort of thing a few times! Were these powerful monsters really those weak zombies?” The rest of the team were behind the black man. A black woman behind him asked in astonishment and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eMany arrows were embedded in the monster’s body, and it was obvious how many arrows she had shot at it. However, every arrow had come to a halt as soon as it entered its body. It was forcibly blocked by those powerful muscles, and the monster’s body seemed to have some corrosive properties. The arrows’ tips slowly vanished. When the final arrow fell off, the wounds on the monster’s body began to wriggle and shut. It looked completely unharmed in the slightest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe monster’s strength had surpassed their imaginations. It was much stronger than those Creepers, mutated or otherwise. Several members of the team used guns with greater firepower to spray out bullets, and a mixed blood used a high power laser to initiate attacks. All this did was blow off some pieces of the monster. The chunks began to wriggle and transform in mid-air, growing out many fine tentacles. The chunks would crawl along on the ground and merge back into the main body. After such a long fight, the monster had not only not been exterminated, but it had also changed continuously, becoming stronger and stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“GO! We won’t tangle with this monster any longer. This is surely a plot change of Resident Evil Extinction. It’ll be hard for our team to handle this monster with our strength. We’ll bring it to the Umbrella Corporation’s building and let the other teams work with us to bring this monster down!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe black man made a prompt decision. He immediately withdrew his totem pole and leapt backwards. As he shouted for his team members to flee together, for some reason, an ill premonition rose in his heart. It was as if he was in a situation of great danger. Who knew what other changes this monster would have that it would tingle his sixth sense such… It was as if a knife was pressed into his back, making goosebumps rise all over his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eToo late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eA member behind him suddenly began to rave madly, continuously using his hands to tear at his flesh. Some blood vessels were actually torn open, but the blood that spurted out didn’t mix into the rainwater. Instead, it was like a thick silk-like paste, every drop of blood connected by a strand of blood. The man began to howl, tearing and digging out his flesh and internal organs, as if only that could free him from his pain. This terrifying scene made everyone involuntarily step away. Everyone looked on at him destroying himself with horror. Not one person dared step forward. The person’s tearing had reached deep inside, and with a scream, he ripped out his own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThat was when they all saw \u003ci style\u003d\"font-style: italic\"\u003eit\u003c/i\u003e clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHis heart had grown teeth and was chewing and gnawing on flesh and blood from some unknown place.

Their minds were a blank. All they desired was to escape from this horrifying place. After all, that man’s fate had been too terrifying to them. Even suicide or getting eaten by zombies would be better some. \u0026nbsp;Any sort of death would be a mercy compared to becoming a monster. All they could do was run as hard as they could.

Based on their level of the unlocked genetic constraint, the first to mutate were those who hadn\u0027t unlocked the constraint, followed by those who had a lower level.
