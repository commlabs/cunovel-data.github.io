Nasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel lost. I look blankly at them both. Will\u0027s face looks like it\u0027s on fire, \"I was forced to uhm, donate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t understand what they\u0027re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake makes an odd motion with his fist, \"He had to wank his pud for the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what this means but I nod before they explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill watches my face and laughs again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake turns the hare, \"So how many little Willy\u0027s are running around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my stomach drop. I understand. I feel judgment burn its way across my face. He shakes his head, \"I don’t know. I wasn’t exactly in on the plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake pokes the hare, \"How was the life there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill laughs, \"Thinking about signing up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks up, \"Hey if there are three square meals a day and I get all the, uhm, reading material I need to deliver the goods, I\u0027m in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humor falls from Will\u0027s face. He almost twitches when he shakes his head, \"No. No three squares and material Jakey. It\u0027s more like milking a cow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake ignores the terror on his brother\u0027s face and grins from ear to ear, \"Are there milk maids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill nods, \"Not the kind you\u0027re thinking of. Mine was a guy named Dr. Angles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake gags, \"Oh shit. Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks down at the drawing again and chuckles but I can tell he\u0027s haunted by it. \"There is no human contact Jake. It\u0027s all done by machines, the girls and the boys. Anyway this section here has the surgeon\u0027s clothes and booties. Change and climb into the garbage bin in the morning on a Tuesday or a Thursday or a Saturday. The garbage comes around lunch and the best chance you have at not being noticed is then. They will be looking for you after lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel sick thinking about the plan. I\u0027m not as strong as the look on my face suggests I am. I gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think this is done.\" Jake pokes the hare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Always over cook wild animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill nudges me with his body, almost playfully, \"You sure about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and reach into the flames to turn the potatoes. The fire licks at my skin but I ignore it. It hurts. It\u0027s a warning of pain to come if I continue to stick my hands in the fire. Sitting between the two men I can\u0027t help but feel like it\u0027s appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouch in the woods gripping the branch of the tree next to me. My stomach is tumbling inside of me. If it weren’t for the fact I was scared beyond functioning, I would blame the hare. It feels like food poisoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the gravel on the road in front of me. I glance back at Jake and Will in the forest hidden by the trees. Jake smirks at me like a goof. Will looks worried. His face is the one I trust. He knows what I\u0027m about to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em we\u0027ll wait okay. We won\u0027t leave you.\" Jake whispers loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave me and Anna if I\u0027m gone longer than two weeks. They\u0027ll have us pregnant by then anyway.\" I say. I\u0027m talking to Will. I know Jake has no survival skills. He would die in the woods waiting for us. He is loyal to the death. Will will leave me before the two weeks is up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill clenches his jaw, \"You be fast Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sneaky. Fast and sneaky. Oh and don\u0027t get pregnant.\" Jake says. I gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror rips through me as I hear the truck. I look at them one last time and hate myself for kissing them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and push myself away from the tree. I run across the road into the ditch, when the truck rounds the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HAULT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run, not as fast as I can. My legs want to push it hard but I have to keep reining them in. They want to flee. They want to do what they\u0027re good at. But if I let them go they will outrun everyone in the truck. I will outrun the truck if I have to. I see a log on the grassy field in front of me. I brace myself for what is going to come next. I half jump and feint tripping. The ground isn’t as soft as I assumed it would be. The strands of grass are filled with sticks and branches I can\u0027t see. They scrape their way across my body as I tumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps of the men, who jumped from the truck to chase me, are coming. I pretend to scramble up to run some more, but they are too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuge hands rip into my arms and throw me to the ground. They pin my face into the rough grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man speaks softly as he fondles my entire body. His hands run my legs and in between my legs. \"Stay calm and we won\u0027t hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a tremble roar though me. The fear has taken me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She looks freaked man. Cuff her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knee digs into my back. I cry out as cold metal grips my wrists. I\u0027m lifted off the ground by my elbows, which bends my arms at painful angles. I want to fight. My body is screaming to defend itself. I breathe heavily, as tears stream from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down. My shirt has drops of blood starting to make shapes on my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s pretty at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see them for the first time. One man is incredibly tall. He must be a foot taller than me. He looks like a man my father was friends with, named Serge. He ran an ammunition and hunting supply place, before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me and narrows his eyes for a moment. The other man grabs my arm and pulls me through the grass. He\u0027s closer to my height and has the fieriest red hair I\u0027ve ever seen. He grins at me, \"I hope you have diabetes or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown at him. I look back at the man I\u0027m almost positive is Serge. He looks at me and nods, \"She\u0027s going to be healthy. You can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redhead smirks, \"Maybe I can find a way to fall on her before we drop her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Serge guy grips my other arm and drags me closer to him, \"No. You leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other guy looks confused, \"Fine if you want her that’s cool. Jesus like I care. There are plenty of ladies in the back of the truck. She has no tits anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest is heaving with panicked breath. My face is stinging where the blood is dripping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffle. Serge takes a cloth from his belt and wipes my face. He gulps and whispers, \"Lenny. You knew Lenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at his green eyes and see the panic. I nod. Lenny was my father. He is Serge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he recalls my name. Dad bought my first camouflage from him. He laughed at my dad for outfitting me at the tender age of four. He hasn’t seen me since I was nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look just like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to smile and remember him. I always thought I looked like her. I\u0027m too scared to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge leans in, \"Go with what I say okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again, but glance at the redhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck is a huge delivering truck. Men stand outside of it with guns. They smile when they see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice find boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at the ass on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge almost rips my arm off as he pulls me into him, \"She\u0027s a fighter. I caught her, I get first dibs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other guys laugh, \"Dirty bastard. You\u0027re old enough to be her daddy.\" One of the men opening the door winks at me as he laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna be her daddy alright.\" My stomach turns and twists. I know, no I hope, Serge is saying it to protect me but I don’t know what he\u0027s been doing for the last ten years. Maybe he likes his job. He did chase me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redhead leans in, \"She smells bad Serge.\" Serge takes my cuffs off as the back door is swung open and I\u0027m pushed toward the opening. I look back at the woods once and climb inside of the truck. I\u0027m thrown forward. I feel something jab between my legs. My face hits the wooden bottom of the truck. I look back at the redhead grabbing at my thighs. I kick before I can stop myself. My boot lands on his nose. I hear a crunch as he is thrown back. He screams. Serge sees what I\u0027ve done and closes the door. I don’t notice the other people in the truck, I just see the light leaving me as a scream tears through he air. \"She broke my fucking nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople pound on the door and muffled screams fill the air around us. I can\u0027t make it all out but it seems the redhead should be allowed to break my nose as revenge. The other men are calming him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark cold air of the truck I hear others. I hear breath and fear in the blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my sore hands into the wooden floor and push myself up onto my knees. I put a hand out in the dark and feel nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman whispers into the darkness, \"Sit against the wall before we start moving girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawl my aching body to the wall of the truck and sit. I press my back against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark I sit as reality fills the small space I am trapped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn flashes I remember it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crystal clear image of my hands pressed against the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of her crying outside my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feel of the vibration from her pounding in her fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear in my heart that everything will be different if I open the door. The look in Leo\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss Leo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I ever see him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes he miss me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck starts up. The air and metal and wood vibrate with the engine. I take a breath. I feel something tickling at the back of my hand that’s pressed against the hard wooden floor. It\u0027s a hand. I turn my hand over. It\u0027s an automatic response. It\u0027s not something I would have done before, but the endless list of things that are possible in my world are taking turns in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a small hand fill my palm. It\u0027s a child\u0027s. Its small body is suddenly pressed against mine. I try not to shake or tremble. It must be more afraid than I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bounce down the road. I know we are less than a day\u0027s walk from the breeder farm. It can\u0027t be far in a truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft whimpers and moans fill the truck that is no longer cool. The body heat creates muggy warmth that makes my skin feel dirtier than it is. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-19.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
