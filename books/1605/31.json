He sniffs me and sneezes. I laugh. He turns and looks at Will, growling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab his mane, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snarls once and then coughs. Will walks to the edge of the road and sits on a log just inside of the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to Will and kneel in front of him, \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I\u0027ll be fine. If I\u0027m not you kill Bern for me okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and look at Bernie who rolls his eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give Leo my severe look for when I want him to listen to my command, he cowers. I point at Will, \"You keep him safe. I\u0027ll be back okay?\" I kneel again and lean into Leo\u0027s fur, \"I like him. Please.\" I stand up and look at them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks like he might growl too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pout my hands on my hips, \"Make it work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo looks at Will and lifts his lip. Will does the same. I clap bringing their faces around to me, \"BEHAVE!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both have the same look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and stalk back to the truck with Bernie. He looks back, \"He\u0027s gonna eat him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No, it\u0027s an act for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"No. Em, he\u0027s gonna eat Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back and notice Leo is in his stance for attack. I laugh and get into the truck. I shout out, \"I mean it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both look at me and then Will loses his breakfast all over the forest floor. Leo jumps back, horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"He\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie starts the truck, \"That’s a big friggin’ wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe race inside with the cure. Anna is out completely, on the couch. Star looks like she\u0027s been crying and Jake looks sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Will?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore him and pull apart the cylinder as Bernie wipes her arm down. He puts a hand out. I pass him the huge needle. He injects it into her arm. He looks worried. That makes me sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has she been like this?\" he asks and puts the back of his hand on her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar hugs herself, \"Two days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake grabs my arms hard, \"Where\u0027s Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, snapping out of the million things I\u0027m thinking that are not good. \"He\u0027s back on the road puking. He\u0027s sick from the vaccine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake scowls, \"You left him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"He\u0027s with Leo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shakes me slightly, \"Em, focus. Is he okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look away from Anna\u0027s sweaty face to him and nod, \"He\u0027s fine.\" I frown, \"Is your throat sore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows and shakes his head, \"It\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie arches an eyebrow, \"The other one in the truck is still good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench my jaw, \"What if he\u0027s not sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I don’t know. Want to wait for him to get sicker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimace and process it. Star jumps up and grabs his arm, spinning him, \"You\u0027re sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clears his throat, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hand on his forehead and nods, \"He\u0027s sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I mutter and run back out to the truck. I grab a wipes packet and the cylinder and run back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tear the packet and wipe his arm down. I give him a grin, \"This is gonna sting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe furrows his dark brow, and as I slide the needle into his arm, he winces. I inject him slowly like we were shown at camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI notice the way Star is gripping to him and smirk. His eyes dart back and forth between us. The blush on his cheeks and the worry on her face, makes me feel better about the choice I\u0027ve made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love him but not in the right way. I want to suck him dry of the goodness inside of him. I want him to fill in the cracks inside of me, smooth out the edges. But what was he ever going to get from the deal? A surly, mean, cross girl who would never know how to love him the way he deserved. Star on the other hand, is light and flighty...like him. She finds joy and peace, even though her life has been hard. She smiles and jokes and wears too short of shorts in an innocent way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Marshall and the others have always seen her as a joke, just like I did. But seeing her as my sister, even a half, was changing things about her…like I was giving her the benefit of the doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie stands and looks at us all, \"This is not good.\" He presses his lips together, \"How old is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young, not old enough for this,\" Jake says and rubs the spot where I\u0027ve taken the needle out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar kisses it better. He looks uncomfortable with her affection in front of me. I wink at him, \"I\u0027m glad you guys were here with her. Was she scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"You know what she\u0027s like…you, but chatty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, \"I\u0027m way more chatty than I used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at Bernie, \"Did she even talk once on the trip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie shrugs, \"She asked a couple questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake laughs, \"Mission questions. She does that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and squat next to Anna, \"Is it too late?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie shakes his head, \"I don’t know. She\u0027s young, they always bounce back faster.\" He sounds defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carry her to the bed for me?\" I ask Jake. He nods and lifts her like she weighs nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he lays her down upstairs, I lie beside her and look at him, \"I\u0027m happy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"I just wish you…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand up, \"I\u0027m happy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Okay.\" He smiles and makes everything better, if only a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stroke her hair, \"She\u0027s so sick. I haven’t ever watched them change before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"It\u0027s bad, I think.\" He sits on the bed and puts his face in his hands, \"I didn’t know what to do. She just started to get sleepy and I let her. I should have kept her awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She needs sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs his hands through his hair, \"this cure better work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yawn, \"Yeah, I\u0027m not gonna imagine the possibility of it not working. I don’t think that’s going to be good for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie pops his head in, \"I\u0027m gassing up and we\u0027re heading back to the city first thing tomorrow morning. It\u0027s her best bet and we can\u0027t leave Will in the woods longer than a day. He has nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown \"You sure about taking her to the city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"She has the cure. The virus can\u0027t be given to anyone once the cure is in the system. It can still hurt her if it\u0027s done enough damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods at Jake, \"You and Star can stay here. You\u0027re not going to get sick now and she\u0027s immune. You\u0027ll be fine here. My dry storage is filled with food. A year or two worth. So if anything happens, Star knows what to do. She knows where the food and hiding places are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a heavy sickness in my chest. Bernie leaves and Jake shakes his head, \"You can\u0027t take her to the city. She\u0027ll end up in a breeder farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"She\u0027ll be lucky to live long enough for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands grab mine and cover them, \"Don’t leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel tears slip down my cheeks; I don’t even know why. I don’t wipe them away. If I acknowledge them, he\u0027ll see them and know I\u0027m crying. I just stare down at our hands and wait for the heavy feeling in my chest to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been so lucky, ya know?\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezes, \"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and look up. He sees the tears and just like Leo would, he pulls me into him and holds me. I lose it. I sob, \"Will is in the w-w-woods with Leo and Anna is s-s-sick and it\u0027s all my f-f-fault. I had to go and k-k-kill my dad. We were all at the cabin. We were all s-s-safe there. I n-never even g-g-got to k-k-kill him. I nev-never even s-saw him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strokes my head, soothingly, \"how fair is that though? We were safe. No one else was. Meg, Sarah, and Anna deserve to live in a world where they don’t have to worry about breeder farms and creepy men. The world is fucked and it deserves a do over. We all do. It\u0027s not fair that people like your father get to run the world like that.\" He pulls me back and wipes my tears, \"You were right. This is the right path. Anna is going to be okay. I know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffle and shake my head, \"If it was any of you putting us at this kind of risk, I\u0027d kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"I know. But you\u0027re insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort and wipe my eyes. I lie back next to Anna and snuggle into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you feeling?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"Sick, like a head cold. I haven’t felt like this since the last time we slept together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold Anna\u0027s burning body next to mine and close my eyes, \"Can you stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel him adjust on the bed, \"Yup.\" I open one eye and see him lying next to us. He puts his hand over hers and squeezes. I close my eye and try to imagine how it would have been if we\u0027d just stayed in the damned mountains, at the cabin. I hate that I dragged them down the damned hill for my own revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall asleep, bitter and pissy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake to movement on the bed. I open my eyes to see her staring at me. I jump back, prepared for her to try eat me. She grins. Her lips are pale but her blood-shot eyes aren’t milky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em,\" her voice is gravely, like it\u0027s barely there. Jake is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears spring from my eyes. I jump on her, hugging her tight to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I\u0027m an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her back, \"Your voice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"My throat still hurts. I don’t think it\u0027s ever gonna be okay again. I coughed a lot of blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hoarse sound of her voice made me want to clear my throat. I put a hand up, \"Don’t talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her clammy forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks around and whispers, \"Star and Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and grin, \"I know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-31.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
