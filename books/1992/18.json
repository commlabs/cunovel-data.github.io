Sleeping? We\u0027ve passed several signs announcing our arrival at the home of the King,\" Tripp said as he grabbed our bags and headed for the hotel to get us a room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The King?\" I asked, following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you know . . . hunka hunka burnin\u0027 love,\" Tripp said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elvis? \"You mean we\u0027re in Memphis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" Tripp said as he pushed open the door to the hotel and held it for me so I could go inside. Our first night I had tried to stay in my own room, but the night terrors had come fast and hard. Since then, we got rooms with two beds and Tripp helped me when the dreams came, which was every night so far. We were both so tired this week that most nights we ended up falling asleep in the same bed once the terror was over, sleeping that way through the rest of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One room, two beds,\" Tripp told the lady, and she glanced over at me, then back at Tripp and flashed him a flirty smile. He got that a lot. When females realized we weren\u0027t together they started throwing themselves at him. He ignored it for the most part. Sometimes there would be a girl he couldn\u0027t ignore. He would flirt back and take her number, which I thought was pointless since we weren\u0027t coming back. But he said he might just come back one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp got the key to our room and we headed to the elevator. I didn\u0027t feel like talking much. I had called Braden earlier and she\u0027d told me that Woods still hadn\u0027t called her. That bothered me. I should have been relieved. But I wasn\u0027t. The longer I was away from him without his calling Tripp or Braden, the more I realized this was what he wanted. Deep down, I\u0027d given him his out. I didn\u0027t want to think about his being in pain. It made it easier to function each day knowing that the never-ending ache in my heart was something I suffered alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re quiet today,\" Tripp said as the elevator door opened and we stepped out onto the second floor. That was as high as Tripp would go. He had a thing about being too high up in a hotel. He said that if the place caught on fire he wanted to know he didn\u0027t have too many flights of stairs to take to get the hell out. I hadn\u0027t really thought about it but he had, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just not in the mood to talk,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your talk with Braden go okay?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure. It had gone fine. She hadn\u0027t brought up Woods. She had only asked me where we had gone and what we were doing. Nothing more. \"Yeah, it was fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp opened the door to our room and glanced back at me. \"You okay if I go out and get a drink tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was code for \"You okay if I go out and get laid tonight?\" He didn\u0027t know that I had this figured out and I preferred that we keep it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery night he went out for a drink he came back around two in the morning smelling like perfume. He would have made a horrible cheating husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to order a pizza and watch cable. Go, do what you want,\" I told him as I walked into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" he said, stepping in behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I need a shower. You leaving now?\" I asked, taking my bag from his hands and heading for the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you in the morning,\" I told him. I stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind me. I waited until I heard the hotel room door close and he had sufficient time to get away before I let the tears come. I\u0027d been holding them back for hours. Crying didn\u0027t make the pain easier, but for that one moment I could lose myself in my sorrow. I didn\u0027t have to hide it. I could let it out freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep down, I knew what I had done was right. I\u0027d let Woods go. My fear that I would hurt him no longer haunted me. He was okay. He was living his life and he would find that someone who could be his perfect fit. What we\u0027d had was never going to be perfect. Love should be simple. I wasn\u0027t simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods deserved someone like Blaire Finlay. He needed a woman by his side who could pull out a gun and take care of herself. A wife who could give him babies that he could love and know they would be mentally healthy. The fear that their mother could snap would never be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would never be a Blaire. I wanted to be more than I wanted my next breath, but it would never happen. I wasn\u0027t Woods\u0027s simple perfection. He would find it one day with someone else. Maybe one day I would find a way to be happy again. Maybe living life would help me find my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refused to believe I would end up damaged like my mother. I might not have been wife-and-mother material, but I was a person. I could be something. I could make a difference in this world. I just had to find out what that something was. Thinking about Woods and his disinterest in finding me wasn\u0027t doing me any good. Crying wasn\u0027t healing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time I healed myself. I didn\u0027t need a man to hold my hand and cuddle me. I needed to do this on my own. Woods had wanted to help me and I\u0027d wanted someone to cling to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp and I had pooled our money together and it had been enough for a while, but it wouldn\u0027t last forever. It was time Tripp went back to his place in South Carolina and I found a life. One that I lived alone. One in which I depended on myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and turned on the shower and undressed. I would wash away my tears and I wouldn\u0027t allow myself to do this again. There was a bravery inside of me that I was going to find and nurture. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-18.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
