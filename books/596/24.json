Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. \"Save us!\" shrieked the terrified people. \"Save the prince,\" cried the captain, \"the rest of us must die!\" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go back!\" shouted he.
