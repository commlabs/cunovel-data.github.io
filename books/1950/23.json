Before he’d even turned off the engine, Olivia had opened her door. “How’s everything?” she asked anxiously as she stepped out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have a baby girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia brought her hands together and pressed them to her heart. “I’m so pleased. And Mary Jo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was incredible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You delivered the baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly. But I was there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing with Mary Jo had brought back so many memories of her own children’s births. Memories that were clear and vivid. The wonder of seeing that beautiful, perfectly formed child. The elation. The feeling of womanly power. She remembered it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If not you, then who?” Olivia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mack McAfee. The other EMT, Brandon, was there, too, but it was Mack who stayed with Mary Jo, who helped her through the worst of it. By the time I arrived, the baby was ready to be born.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure she was happy to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo had been, but she hadn’t really needed Grace; she and Mack had worked together with a sense of ease and mutual trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace almost felt as if she’d intruded on something very private. The communication between Mack and Mary Jo had been—she hesitated to use this word—spiritual. It was focused entirely on the birth, on what each needed to do to get that baby born. Grace felt moved to tears, even now, as she thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma, listen!” Tyler shouted. He pounded on his drum, making an excruciating racket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace covered her ears. “Gently, Tyler, gently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler frowned as he looked up at her. “I was playing my best for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember the song about the little drummer boy?” Olivia asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler nodded eagerly. “It’s my favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It says in the song that he went pa-rum-pum-pum-pum, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t say he beat the drum like crazy until baby Jesus’s mother put her hands over her ears and asked him to go next door and play.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler laughed. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, try it more slowly now,” Grace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler did, tapping on the drum in a soft rhythm that was pleasing to the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lovely,” Grace told her grandson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I play for the ox and the lamb?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the song they kept time, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Tyler raced away to show his cousins what he’d learned and to serenade the animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come in for a cup of coffee,” Cliff suggested to Olivia and Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should head home,” Jack said. His arm rested protectively on Olivia’s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted to make sure everything turned out well,” Olivia explained. “Do you think I could see Mary Jo and the baby for a few minutes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see why not,” Grace said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women left the men outside to chat while Grace led the way up to the small apartment. Brandon Hutton sat on the top step with his medical equipment, filling out paperwork. He shifted aside and they skirted around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary Jo?” Grace asked, standing in the doorway to the bedroom. “Would it be okay if Olivia came in to see the baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. That would be fine,” Mary Jo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they walked into the bedroom, they found Mary Jo sitting up, holding her baby in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my,” Olivia whispered as she reached the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s so tiny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t feel so tiny a little while ago.” Mary Jo looked up with a comical expression. “I felt like I was giving birth to an elephant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was worth it, though,” Olivia said and tenderly ran her finger over the baby’s head. “She’s just gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never would’ve believed how much you can love such a tiny baby.” Mary Jo’s voice was filled with wonder. “I thought my heart would burst with love when Mack put her in my arms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a name for her?” Grace asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet. I had one picked out, but now I’m not sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s a special baby born on a special night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking the same thing,” Mary Jo said, kissing the newborn’s forehead. Her gaze fell lovingly on the child. “When I was first pregnant…I was so embarrassed and afraid, I prayed God would just let me die. And now…now I see her as an incredible gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had felt that way when she discovered she was pregnant with Maryellen all those years ago. It was shortly before her high school graduation; she’d been dating Dan Sherman and their relationship had always been on-again, off-again. She’d dreaded telling him she was pregnant, even more than she’d dreaded telling her parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor weeks she’d kept her secret, embarrassed and ashamed. But like Mary Jo, she’d learned to see the pregnancy as an unexpected gift, and the moment Maryellen was placed in her arms, Grace had experienced an overwhelming surge of love. The birth hadn’t been easy, they never really were, but as soon as she saw her daughter, Grace had recognized that every minute of that pain had been worth the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you need anything,” Olivia was saying to Mary Jo, “please don’t hesitate to call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. That’s so kind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia turned to Mack, who hovered in the background. “Are you taking her to the birthing center in Silverdale?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “We’ll be leaving in about ten minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I won’t keep you,” Olivia said. “I’ll stop by sometime tomorrow afternoon,” she promised Mary Jo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, please don’t,” Mary Jo said quickly. “It’s Christmas—spend that time with your family. I’ll get in touch soon. Anyway, I’ll be with my own family.” She looked up, her eyes widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary Jo?” Grace asked in alarm. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my goodness!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Mack’s voice was equally worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My brothers,” Mary Jo said. “They never showed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s true.” The entire matter had slipped Grace’s mind. “Mary Jo’s brothers were due here—” she checked her watch “—three hours ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where could they be?” Mary Jo wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace tried to reassure her. “They’re probably lost. It’s easy enough with all these back roads. They’ve never been in this area before, have they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. As soon as they arrive, I’ll tell them what happened and where to find you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo smiled down at the infant cradled in her arms. “They’ll hardly believe I had the baby,” she murmured. “But then it’s hard for me to believe, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll call you tomorrow,” Olivia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, but please…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell your parents about the baby yet. Give them a chance to settle back into their routine before you let them know about David and me—and the baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t say a word until you and I agree the time is right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace was impressed that Mary Jo wanted to spare Ben and Charlotte the unsavory news of David’s betrayal until they were more prepared to accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll leave you now,” Olivia told her. “But like I said, if you need anything, anytime, please call. You’re practically family, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo thanked her softly. “You all feel like family to me…. Everyone’s been so wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace walked down the stairs with Olivia. She was surprised to see Jack and Cliff still outside, huddled with the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s Cliff up to now?” Grace wondered aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack glanced over then. “You gotta see this!” he said, waving at Olivia. He sounded like a giddy child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Grace saw the huge carton of fireworks Cliff had dragged out, she groaned. “Cliff!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was saving them for New Year’s Eve, but I can’t think of a better night for celebrating, can you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the horses?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re all safe in their stalls. Don’t worry about them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Buttercup? She hates that kind of noise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s locked in the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we, Grandpa, can we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were jumping up and down, clapping their hands with enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why right now?” Grace asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff sent her a look of pure innocence. “I was just casting about for a way to keep the grandkids entertained.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, all right.” She sighed loudly, holding back a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay if we stay and watch?” Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace and Olivia exchanged looks. As they’d often had occasion to observe, most men were little boys at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you must,” Olivia murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opened and Kelly stepped out with Paul, who still held the baby. Grace’s daughter balanced a large tray filled with mugs and Lisa followed with a tin of Christmas cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone for hot chocolate?” Kelly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d love a cup,” Olivia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too,” Grace added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul glanced over at the kids. “What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fireworks in a few minutes,” Grace told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow! Great idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men,” Olivia whispered under her breath, and then both Olivia and Grace broke into giggles, just like they had when they were schoolgirls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did we get so lost—twice?” Linc groaned. The only thing left to do was return to Cedar Cove and start over. That sounded easy enough, except that he no longer knew how to find the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That King did us wrong,” Mel muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think?” Linc said sarcastically. He was past frustration, past impatience and past losing his cool. All he wanted was to track down his pregnant sister and bring her home. That shouldn’t be such an impossible task, and yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m never going back to King’s,” Ned said in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, neither,” Mel spat. “If I ever go back to Cedar Cove, which is unlikely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankly, Linc was of the same mind, at least as far as King went. The man had blackmailed him into paying for directions and then completely misled him. True, the sandwiches weren’t bad, but he’d overcharged them. The old coot had an evil streak a mile wide. If he thought it was fun to misdirect them, then he had a perverse sense of humor, too. Perverse? Downright twisted!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s find a phone that works,” Ned suggested, not for the first time. His brother had harped on that for the last half hour. Their cell phones were useless out here. But it wasn’t as if there was a phone booth sitting on the side of the road just waiting for them to appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, you find one, Ned, and I’ll be more than happy to pay for the call.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-cedar-cove-christmas-cedar-cove-0/page-23.html","bookId":1950,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:30 AM"}
