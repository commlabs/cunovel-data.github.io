But all of that was taken away in an instant. Now she\u0027s getting by as best she can, though sometimes that means doing things the old Nova would never do. Things that are slowly eating away at her spirit. Every day blends into the next . . . until she meets Quinton Carter. His intense, honey brown eyes instantly draw her in, and he looks just about as broken as she feels inside. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eQuinton once got a second chance at life-but he doesn\u0027t want it.
