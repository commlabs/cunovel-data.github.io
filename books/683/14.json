Here he paused. \u0026nbsp;‘Women didn’t do such things.’ \u0026nbsp;All at once there came back to him fragments of discussions—in which Stephen had had a part, in which matters of convention had been dealt with. \u0026nbsp;Out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to his heart, though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it. \u0026nbsp;He knew that Stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality of the sexes. \u0026nbsp;Was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her theories?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet. \u0026nbsp;He stood up, and walked the room. \u0026nbsp;Somehow he felt light beginning to dawn, though he could not tell its source, or guess at the final measure of its fulness. \u0026nbsp;The fact of Stephen having done such a thing was hard to bear; but it was harder to think that she should have done such a thing without a motive; or worse: with love of Leonard as a motive! \u0026nbsp;He shuddered as he paused. \u0026nbsp;She could not love such a man. \u0026nbsp;It was monstrous! \u0026nbsp;And yet she had done this thing . . . ‘Oh, if she had had any one to advise her, to restrain her! \u0026nbsp;But she had no mother! \u0026nbsp;No mother! \u0026nbsp;Poor Stephen!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The pity of it, not for himself but for the woman he loved, overcame him. \u0026nbsp;Sitting down heavily before his desk, he put his face on his hands, and his great shoulders shook.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Long, long after the violence of his emotion had passed, he sat there motionless, thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew; thinking for Stephen’s good.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it. \u0026nbsp;He may blunder; but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the main right. \u0026nbsp;So it was with Harold. \u0026nbsp;He knew that he was ignorant of women, and of woman’s nature, as distinguished from man’s. \u0026nbsp;The only woman he had ever known well was Stephen; and she in her youth and in her ignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to supply to him data for his present needs. \u0026nbsp;To a clean-minded man of his age a woman is something divine. \u0026nbsp;It is only when in later life disappointment and experience have hammered bitter truth into his brain, that he begins to realise that woman is not angelic but human. \u0026nbsp;When he knows more, and finds that she is like himself, human and limited but with qualities of purity and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame, he realises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be the vague, unreal creations of his dreams. \u0026nbsp;And then he can thank God for His goodness that when He might have given us Angels He did give us women!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of one thing, despite the seeming of facts, he was sure: Stephen did not love Leonard. \u0026nbsp;Every fibre of his being revolted at the thought. \u0026nbsp;She of so high a nature; he of so low. \u0026nbsp;She so noble; he so mean. \u0026nbsp;Bah! the belief was impossible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Impossible! \u0026nbsp;Herein was the manifestation of his ignorance; anything is possible where love is concerned! \u0026nbsp;It was characteristic of the man that in his mind he had abandoned, for the present at all events, his own pain. \u0026nbsp;He still loved Stephen with all the strength of his nature, but for him the selfish side ceased to exist. \u0026nbsp;He was trying to serve Stephen; and every other thought had to give way. \u0026nbsp;He had been satisfied that in a manner she loved him in some way and in some degree; and he had hoped that in the fulness of time the childish love would ripen, so that in the end would come a mutual affection which was of the very essence of Heaven. \u0026nbsp;He believed still that she loved him in some way; but the future that was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing hand. \u0026nbsp;She had actually proposed marriage to another man. \u0026nbsp;If the idea of a marriage with him had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt of her feeling toward another. . . . And yet? \u0026nbsp;And yet he could not believe that she loved Leonard; not even if all trains of reasoning should end by leading to that point. \u0026nbsp;One thing he had at present to accept, that whatever might be the measure of affection Stephen might have for him, it was not love as he understood it. \u0026nbsp;He resolutely turned his back on the thought of his own side of the matter, and tried to find some justification of Stephen’s act.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to ye’ has perhaps a general as well as a special significance. \u0026nbsp;It is by patient tireless seeking that many a precious thing has been found. \u0026nbsp;It was after many a long cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual result. \u0026nbsp;Harold came to believe, vaguely at first but more definitely as the evidence nucleated, that Stephen’s act was due to some mad girlish wish to test her own theory; to prove to herself the correctness of her own reasoning, the fixity of her own purpose. \u0026nbsp;He did not go on analysing further; for as he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken from his heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken. \u0026nbsp;The day would soon be upon him, and there was work to be done. \u0026nbsp;Instinctively he knew that there was trouble in store for Stephen, and he felt that in such an hour he should be near her. \u0026nbsp;All her life she had been accustomed to him. \u0026nbsp;In her sorrows to confide in him, to tell him her troubles so that they might dwindle and pass away; to enhance her pleasures by making him a sharer in them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold was inspirited by the coming of the new day. \u0026nbsp;There was work to be done, and the work must be based on thought. \u0026nbsp;His thoughts must take a practical turn; what was he to do that would help Stephen? \u0026nbsp;Here there dawned on him for the first time the understanding of a certain humiliation which she had suffered; she had been refused! \u0026nbsp;She who had stepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she had always walked as to propose marriage to a man, had been refused! \u0026nbsp;He did not, could not, know to the full the measure of such humiliation to a woman; but he could guess at any rate a part. \u0026nbsp;And that guessing made him grind his teeth in impotent rage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But out of that rage came an inspiration. \u0026nbsp;If Stephen had been humiliated by the refusal of one man, might not this be minimised if she in turn might refuse another? \u0026nbsp;Harold knew so well the sincerity of his own love and the depth of his own devotion that he was satisfied that he could not err in giving the girl the opportunity of refusing him. \u0026nbsp;It would be some sort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that Leonard’s views were not shared by all men. \u0026nbsp;That there were others who would deem it a joy to serve as her slaves. \u0026nbsp;When she had refused him she would perhaps feel easier in her mind. \u0026nbsp;Of course if she did not refuse him . . . Ah! well, then would the gates of Heaven open . . . But that would never be. \u0026nbsp;The past could not be blotted out! \u0026nbsp;All he could do would be to serve her. \u0026nbsp;He would go early. \u0026nbsp;Such a man as Leonard Everard might make some new complication, and the present was quite bad enough.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a poor enough thing for him, he thought at length. \u0026nbsp;She might trample on him; but it was for her sake. \u0026nbsp;And to him what did it matter? \u0026nbsp;The worst had come. \u0026nbsp;All was over now!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3234/88494.html","bookId":683,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:30:08 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:30:08 AM"}
