Some of thenew officers thought the representations looked “pretty.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To Chief McRobb, however, each pixel on the screens represented danger. So many things could hide inmultidimensional space: pirates, black marketers . . . the Covenant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McRobb inspected their duty stations. He double-checked that all programs and hardware were runningwithin UNSC specifications. He ran his hand along the monitors and keypads looking for dust. Theirstations were in tip-top shape.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Considering what they were guarding, Reach, anything less than perfection was unacceptable. He madecertain his crew knew it, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Carry on,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Since the battle of Sigma Octanus, FLEETCOM had reassigned top people to its Remote SensingStations. Chief McRobb had been pulled from Fort York on the edge of the Inner Colonies. He had spentthe last three months helping his crew brush up on their abstract and complex algebras to interpret theprobe data.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ready to send out the next set of probes, sir,” Lieutenant Streeter said. “Linear accelerator andSlipspace generators online and charged.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Set for thirty-second return cycle and launch,” Chief McRobb ordered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, sir. Probes away, sir. Accelerated and entering the Slipstream.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FLEETCOM didn’t really expect anything to attack the Reach Military Complex. It was the heart of theUNSC military operations. If anything did attack it, the battle would be a short one. There were twentySuper MAC guns in orbit. They could accelerate a three-thousand-ton projectile to point four-tenths thespeed of light—and place that projectile with pinpoint accuracy. If that wasn’t enough to stop aCovenant fleet, there were anywhere from a hundred to a hundred and fifty ships in the system at anygiven time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chief McRobb knew, though, there had been another military base that was once thought too strong toattack—and the military had paid the price for their lack of vigilance. He wasn’t about to let Reachbecome another Pearl Harbor. Not on his watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Probes returning, sir,” Lieutenant Brightling announced. “Alpha reentering normal space in three . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e two . . . one. Scanning sectors. Signal acquired at extraction point minus forty five thousand kilometers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Process the signals and send out the recovery drone, Lieutenant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, sir. Getting signal lock on—” The Lieutenant squinted at his monitor. “Sir, would you take a lookat this?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “On the board, Lieutenant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Radar and neutron imager silhouettes appeared on-screen—and filled the display. Chief McRobb hadnever seen anything like it in Slipstream space.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Confirm that the data stream is not corrupted,” the Chief ordered. “I’m estimating that object is threethousand kilometers in diameter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Affirmative . . . thirty-two-hundred-kilometer diameter confirmed, sir. Signal integrity is green. We’llhave a trajectory for the planetoid as soon as Beta probe returns.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was rare for any natural object this large to be in Slipstream space. An occasional comet or asteroidhad been logged—UNSC astrophysicists still weren’t sure how the things got into the alternatedimension. But there had never been anything like this. At least, not since—“Oh my God,” McRobb whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not since Sigma Octanus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We’re not waiting for Beta probe,” Chief McRobb barked. “We are initiating the Cole Protocol.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Streeter, purge the navigational database, and I meanright now . Lieutenant Brightling,remove the safety interlocks on the station’s reactor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His junior officers hesitated for a moment—then they understood the gravity of their situation. Theymoved quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Initiating viral data scavengers,” Lieutenant Streeter called out. “Dumping main and cache memory.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned in his seat, his face white. “Sir, the science library is offline for repairs. It has every UNSCastrophysics journal in it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “With navigation data on every star within a hundred light-years,” the Chief whispered. “Including Sol.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant, you get someone down there and destroy that data. I don’t care if they have to hit it with agoddamn sledgehammer—make sure that data is wiped.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, sir!” Streeter turned to the COM and began issuing frantic orders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Safety interlocks red on the board,” Lieutenant Brightling reported. His lips pressed into a single whiteline, concentrating. “Beta probe returning, sir, in four . . . three . . . two . . . one. There. Off target onehundred twenty thousand kilometers. Signal is weak. The probe appears to be malfunctioning. Trying toscrub the signal now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s too much of a coincidence that it’s malfunctioning, Streeter,” the Chief said. “Get FLEETCOM onAlpha channel on the double! Compress and send the duty log.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, sir.” Lieutenant Streeter’s fingers fumbled with the keypad as he typed—then had to retype thecommand. “Logs sent.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Beta probe signal on the board,” Lieutenant Brightling reported. “Calculating the object’s trajectory . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The planetoid was closer. Its edges, however, had abnormalities—bumps and spikes and protrusions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chief McRobb shifted and clenched his hands into fists.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It will pass though Reach System,” Lieutenant Brightling said. “Intersecting the solar plane inseventeen seconds at the system’s outer edge at zero four one.” He inhaled sharply. “Sir, that’s only alight-second away from us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Streeter stood and knocked over his chair, almost backing into the Chief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McRobb righted the chair. “Sit down, Lieutenant. We’ve got a job to do. Target the telescope array tomonitor that region of space.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Streeter turned and gazed into the rock-solid features of the Chief. He took a deep breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir.” He sat back down. “Aye, sir, moving the array.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Gamma probe returning in three . . . two . . . one.” Lieutenant Brightling paused. “There’s no signal, sir.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scanning. Time plus four seconds and counting. Probe may have translated on a temporal axis.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think so,” the Chief murmured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Streeter said, “Telescope array now on target, sir. On the main view screen.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pinpoints of green light appeared at the edge of the Reach solar system. They collected and swarmed asif they were caught in a boiling liquid. Space stretched, smeared, and distorted. Half the stars in thatregion were blotted out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Radar contact,” Lieutenant Brightling said. “Contact with . . . more than three hundred large objects.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His hands started to shake. “Sir, silhouettes match known Covenant profiles.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They’re accelerating,” Lieutenant Streeter whispered. “On an intercept course for the station.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “FLEETCOM network connections are being infiltrated,” Lieutenant Brightling said. His tremblinghands could barely type in commands. “Cutting our connection.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chief McRobb stood as straight as he could. “What about the astrophysics data?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir, they’re still trying to end the diagnostic cycle, but that takes a few minutes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then we don’t have a lot of options,” McRobb muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He set his hand on Lieutenant Brightling’s shoulder to steady the young officer. “It’s all right,Lieutenant. We’ve done the best we could. We’ve done our duty. There’s nothing more to worry about.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He set his palmprint on the control station. The Chief locked out the reactor safeties and saturated thefusion chamber with their deuterium reserve tanks. Chief McRobb said, “Just one last order to carry out.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29444.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:13:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:13:03 AM"}
