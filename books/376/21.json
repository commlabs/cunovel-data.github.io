{"id":39397,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. THE HOTEL DU GLACIER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;High up among the Bernese Alps stands the Hotel du Glacier. It is a small hotel, of limited accommodations, but during the season it is generally full of visitors. The advantage is, that a comparatively short walk carries one to a point where he has a fine view of that mountain scenery which is the glory of Switzerland, and draws thither thousands of pilgrims annually. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In rustic chairs outside sat at eight o\u0027clock in the morning our young hero, Frank Hunter, and his temporary guardian, Colonel Sharpley. In front a beautiful prospect spread out before the two travelers. Snowy peaks, their rough surface softened by distance, abounding in beetling cliffs and fearful gorges, but overlooking smiling valleys, were plainly visible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [193]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Isn\u0027t it magnificent?\" exclaimed Frank, with the enthusiasm of youth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I dare say,\" said Sharpley, yawning, \"but I\u0027m not romantic; I\u0027ve outlived all that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t believe I shall ever outlive my admiration for such scenery as this,\" thought Frank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you enjoy it?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, so so; but the fact is, I came here chiefly because I thought you would like it. I\u0027ve been the regular Swiss tour more than once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are very kind to take so much trouble on my account,\" said Frank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I might as well be here as anywhere,\" said Sharpley. \"Just at present there is nothing in particular to take up my attention. Did you order breakfast?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Colonel Sharpley.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go and ask if it isn\u0027t ready, will you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank entered the inn, and soon returned with the information that breakfast was ready. They entered a small dining-room, where they found the simple meal awaiting them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [194]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The regular Swiss breakfast consists of coffee, bread and butter, and honey, and costs, let me add, for the gratification of my reader\u0027s curiosity, thirty cents in gold. Dinner comprises soup, three courses of meat, and a pudding or fruit, and costs from sixty cents to a dollar, according to the pretensions of the hotel. In fact, so far as hotel expenses go, two dollars a day in gold will be quite sufficient in the majority of cases. If meat is required for breakfast, that is additional.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How good the coffee is,\" said Frank. \"I never tasted it as good in America.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They know how to make it here, but why didn\u0027t you order breakfast?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I thought they would supply meat without an order.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I always want meat; I have got beyond my bread-and-butter days,\" said Sharpley, with a dash of sarcasm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have not,\" said Frank, \"especially when both are so good. What are your plans for the day, Colonel Sharpley?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think we\u0027ll take a climb after breakfast,\" said Sharpley. \"What do you say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [195]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like nothing better,\" said Frank, eagerly. \"But,\" he added, \"I am afraid you are going entirely on my account.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How well the boy has guessed it,\" thought Sharpley. \"It is on his account I am going, but he must not know that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no,\" he said; \"I feel like taking a ramble among the hills. It would be stupid staying at the inn.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then,\" said Frank, with satisfaction, \"I shall be glad to go. Shall we take a guide?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not this morning,\" said Sharpley. \"Let us have the pleasure of exploring independently. To-morrow we will arrange a long excursion with guides.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose it is quite safe?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, if we don\u0027t wander too far. I shall be ready in about half an hour.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will be ready,\" said Frank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I\u0027ll smoke a cigar.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then a gentleman came up, whose acquaintance they had made the previous day. It was a Mr. Abercrombie, an American gentleman, from Chicago, who was accompanied by his son Henry, a boy about Frank\u0027s age.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [196]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What are your plans for to-day, Mr. Sharpley?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope he isn\u0027t going to thrust himself upon us,\" thought Sharpley, savagely, for he was impatient of anything that was likely to interfere with his wicked design.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have none in particular,\" he answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are not going to remain at the inn, are you? That would be dull.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Confound the man\u0027s curiosity!\" muttered Sharpley, to himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I may wander about a little, but I shall make no excursion worth speaking of till to-morrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why can\u0027t we join company?\" said Mr. Abercrombie, in a friendly manner. \"Our young people are well acquainted, and we can keep each other company. Enlarge your plan a little, and take a guide.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish the man was back in America,\" thought Sharpley. \"Why won\u0027t he see that he\u0027s a bore?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really,\" he said, stiffly, \"you must excuse me; I don\u0027t feel equal to any sort of an excursion to-day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [197]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then,\" said the other, still in a friendly way, \"let your boy come with us. I will look after him, and my son will like his company.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank heard this application, and as he had taken a fancy to Henry and his father, he hoped that Sharpley would reply favorably. He felt that he should enjoy their company better than his guardian\u0027s.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sharpley was greatly irritated, but obliged to keep within the bounds of politeness to avoid suspicion, when something had happened, as he meant something should happen before the sun set.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you won\u0027t think me impolite,\" he said, \"but I mean, by and by, to walk a little, and would like Frank\u0027s company. To-morrow I shall be very happy to join you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nothing more could be said, of course, but Henry Abercrombie whispered to Frank:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m sorry we\u0027re not going to be together to-day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So am I,\" answered Frank; \"but we\u0027ll have a bully time to-morrow. I suppose I ought to stay with Colonel Sharpley.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He isn\u0027t any relation of yours, is he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [198]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no; I am only traveling in his company.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So I thought. You don\u0027t look much alike.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I suppose not.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Half an hour passed, but the Abercrombies were still there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shall we go?\" asked Frank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not, yet,\" said Sharpley, shortly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He did not mean to start till the other travelers were gone, lest he should be followed. For he had screwed his courage to the sticking point, and made up his mind that he would that day do the deed which he had covenanted with Mr. Craven to do. The sooner the better, he thought, for it would bring him nearer the large sum of money which he expected to realize as the price of our hero\u0027s murder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twenty minutes afterward the Abercrombies, equipped for a mountain walk, swinging their alpenstocks, started off, accompanied by a guide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t you reconsider your determination and go?\" asked the father.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sharpley shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [199]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t feel equal to the exertion,\" he answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you\u0027ll have a pleasant excursion, Henry,\" said Frank, looking wistfully after his young friend.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would be pleasanter if you were going along,\" said Henry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank said no more, but waited till Sharpley had smoked another cigar. By this time twenty minutes had elapsed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think we\u0027ll go now, Frank,\" said Sharpley.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the welcome intimation Frank jumped up briskly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shall I order some lunch to be packed for us?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; we sha\u0027n\u0027t need it,\" said Sharpley.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think I\u0027ll get some for myself,\" said Frank, laughing, as he added: \"I\u0027ve got a healthy appetite, Colonel Sharpley, and I am sure the exertion of climbing these hills will make me fearfully hungry.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to be delayed,\" said Sharpley, frowning. \"We sha\u0027n\u0027t be [200] gone long enough to need lunch.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It won\u0027t take me a minute,\" said Frank, running into the inn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is strange he is so much in a hurry all at once,\" thought our young hero, \"when he has been lounging about for an hour without appearing in the least haste.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n However, he did not spend much thought on Sharpley\u0027s wayward humor, which he was beginning to see was regulated by no rules.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Less than five minutes afterward he appeared, provided with a tourist\u0027s lunch-box.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve got enough for you, Colonel Sharpley,\" he said, \"in case we stay out longer than we anticipate.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The landlord closely followed him, and addressed himself to Sharpley:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will not monsieur have a guide?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" said Sharpley.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My son, Baptiste, is an experienced guide, and can show monsieur and his young friend the finest prospects.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [201]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall need no guide,\" said Sharpley, impatiently. \"Frank, come along.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It will only be six francs,\" persisted the landlord, \"and Baptiste—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want Baptiste,\" said Sharpley, gruffly. \"Plague take the man!\" he muttered to himself. \"He is making himself a regular nuisance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish he would take a guide,\" thought Frank, no suspicion of the importance to himself of having one entering his mind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81723.html","bookId":376,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM"}
