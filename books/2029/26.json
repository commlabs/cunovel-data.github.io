Some days Ian was with me, some days Doc, and some days only Jamie. I weeded fields, kneaded bread, and scrubbed counters. I carried water, boiled onion soup, washed clothes in the far end of the black pool, and burned my hands making that acidic soap. Everyone did their part, and since I had no right to be here, I tried to work twice as hard as the others. I could not earn a place, I knew that, but I tried to make my presence as light a burden as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to know a little about the humans around me, mostly just by listening to them. I learned their names, at least. The caramel-skinned woman was named Lily, and she was from Philadelphia. She had a dry sense of humor and got along well with everyone because she never got ruffled. The young man with the bristly black hair, Wes, stared at her a lot, but she never seemed to notice that. He was only nineteen, and he\u0027d escaped from Eureka, Montana. The sleepy-eyed mother was named Lucina, and her two boys were Isaiah and Freedom-Freedom had been born right here in the caves, delivered by Doc. I didn\u0027t see much of these three; it seemed that the mother kept her children as separate from me as was possible in this limited space. The balding, red-cheeked man was Trudy\u0027s husband; his name was Geoffrey. They were often with another older man, Heath, who had been Geoffrey\u0027s best friend since early childhood; the three had escaped the invasion together. The pallid man with the white hair was Walter. He was sick, but Doc didn\u0027t know what was wrong with him-there was no way to find out, not without labs and tests, and even if Doc could diagnose the problem, he had no medicine to treat it. As the symptoms progressed, Doc was starting to think it was a form of cancer. This pained me-to watch someone actually dying from something so easily fixed. Walter tired easily but was always cheerful. The white-blond woman-her eyes contrastingly dark-who\u0027d brought water to the others that first day in the field was Heidi. Travis, John, Stanley, Reid, Carol, Violetta, Ruth Ann... I knew all the names, at least. There were thirty-five humans in the colony, with six of them gone on the raid, Jared included. Twenty-nine humans in the caves now, and one mostly unwelcome alien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also learned more about my neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan and Kyle shared the cave on my hallway with the two real doors propped over the entrance. Ian had begun bunking with Wes in another corridor in protest of my presence here, but he\u0027d moved back after just two nights. The other nearby caves had also gone vacant for a while. Jeb told me the occupants were afraid of me, which made me laugh. Were twenty-nine rattlesnakes afraid of a lone field mouse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Paige was back, next door, in the cave she shared with her partner, Andy, whose absence she mourned. Lily was with Heidi in the first cave, with the flowered sheets; Heath was in the second, with the duct-taped cardboard; and Trudy and Geoffrey were in the third, with a striped quilt. Reid and Violetta were one cave farther down the hall than mine, their privacy protected by a stained and threadbare oriental carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth cave in this corridor belonged to Doc and Sharon, and the fifth to Maggie, but none of these three had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc and Sharon were partnered, and Maggie, in her rare moments of sarcastic humor, teased Sharon that it had taken the end of humanity for Sharon to find the perfect man: every mother wanted a doctor for her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharon was not the girl I\u0027d seen in Melanie\u0027s memories. Was it the years of living alone with the dour Maggie that had changed her into a more brightly colored version of her mother? Though her relationship with Doc was newer to this world than I was, she showed none of the softening effects of new love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew the duration of that relationship from Jamie-Sharon and Maggie rarely forgot when I was in a room with them, and their conversation was guarded. They were still the strongest opposition, the only people here whose ignoring me continued to feel aggressively hostile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d asked Jamie how Sharon and Maggie had gotten here. Had they found Jeb on their own, beaten Jared and Jamie here? He seemed to understand the real question: had Melanie\u0027s last effort to find them been entirely a waste?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie told me no. When Jared had showed him Melanie\u0027s last note, explained that she was gone-it took him a moment to be able to speak again after that word, and I could see in his face what this moment had done to them both-they\u0027d gone to look for Sharon themselves. Maggie had held Jared at the point of an antique sword while he tried to explain; it had been a close thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had not taken long with Maggie and Jared working together for them to decipher Jeb\u0027s riddle. The four of them had gotten to the caves before I\u0027d moved from Chicago to San Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jamie and I spoke of Melanie, it was not as difficult as it should have been. She was always a part of these conversations-soothing his pain, smoothing my awkwardness-though she had little to say. She rarely spoke to me anymore, and when she did it was muted; now and then I wasn\u0027t sure if I really heard her or just my own idea of what she might think. But she made an effort for Jamie. When I heard her, it was always with him. When she didn\u0027t speak, we both felt her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is Melanie so quiet now?\" Jamie asked me late one night. For once, he wasn\u0027t grilling me about Spiders and Fire-Tasters. We were both tired-it had been a long day pulling carrots. The small of my back was in knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard for her to talk. It takes so much more effort than it takes you and me. She doesn\u0027t have anything she wants to say that badly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does she do all the time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She listens, I think. I guess I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you hear her now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yawned, and he was quiet. I thought he was asleep. I drifted in that direction, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think she\u0027ll go away? Really gone?\" Jamie suddenly whispered. His voice caught on the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not a liar, and I don\u0027t think I could have lied to Jamie if I were. I tried not to think about the implications of my feelings for him. Because what did it mean if the greatest love I\u0027d ever felt in my nine lives, the first true sense of family, of maternal instinct, was for an alien life-form? I shoved the thought away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I told him. And then, because it was true, I added, \"I hope not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like her like you like me? Did you used to hate her, like she hated you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s different than how I like you. And I never really hated her, not even in the beginning. I was very afraid of her, and I was angry that because of her I couldn\u0027t be like everyone else. But I\u0027ve always, always admired strength, and Melanie is the strongest person I\u0027ve ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie laughed. \"You were afraid of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think your sister can be scary? Remember the time you went too far up the canyon, and when you came home late she ��threw a raging hissy fit,\u0027 according to Jared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled at the memory. I was pleased, having distracted him from his painful question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was eager to keep the peace with all my new companions in any way I could. I thought I was willing to do anything, no matter how backbreaking or smelly, but it turned out I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I was thinking,\" Jeb said to me one day, maybe two weeks after everyone had \"calmed down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to hate those words from Jeb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember what I was saying about you maybe teaching a little here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy answer was curt. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, how \u0027bout it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to think it through. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy refusal sent an unexpected pang of guilt through me. I\u0027d never refused a Calling before. It felt like a selfish thing to do. Obviously, though, this was not the same. The souls would have never asked me to do something so suicidal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at me, scrunching his caterpillar eyebrows together. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think Sharon would like that?\" I asked him in an even voice. It was just one example, but perhaps the most forceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, still frowning, acknowledging my point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s for the greater good,\" he grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"The greater good? Wouldn\u0027t that be shooting me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda, that\u0027s shortsighted,\" he said, arguing with me as if my answer had been a serious attempt at persuasion. \"What we have here is a very unusual opportunity for learning. It would be wasteful to squander that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t think anyone wants to learn from me. I don\u0027t mind talking to you or Jamie -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter what they want,\" Jeb insisted. \"It\u0027s what\u0027s good for them. Like chocolate versus broccoli. Ought to know more about the universe-not to mention the new tenants of our planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does it help them, Jeb? Do you think I know something that could destroy the souls? Turn the tide? Jeb, it\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not over while we\u0027re still here,\" he told me, grinning so I knew he was teasing me again. \"I don\u0027t expect you to turn traitor and give us some super-weapon. I just think we should know more about the world we live in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched at the word traitor. \"I couldn\u0027t give you a weapon if I wanted to, Jeb. We don\u0027t have some great weakness, an Achilles\u0027 heel. No archenemies out there in space who could come to your aid, no viruses that will wipe us out and leave you standing. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sweat it.\" He made a fist and tapped it playfully against my arm. \"You might be surprised, though. I told you it gets boring in here. People might want your stories more than you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Jeb would not leave it alone. Was Jeb capable of conceding defeat? I doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt mealtimes I usually sat with Jeb and Jamie, if he was not in school or busy elsewhere. Ian always sat near, though not really with us. I could not fully accept the idea of his self-appointed role as my bodyguard. It seemed too good to be true and thus, by human philosophy, clearly false.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days after I\u0027d refused Jeb\u0027s request to teach the humans \"for their own good,\" Doc came to sit by me during the evening meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharon remained where she was, in the corner farthest from my usual place. She was alone today, without her mother. She didn\u0027t turn to watch Doc walking toward me. Her vivid hair was wound into a high bun, so I could see that her neck was stiff, and her shoulders were hunched, tense and unhappy. It made me want to leave at once, before Doc could say whatever he meant to say to me, so that I could not be considered in collusion with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jamie was with me, and he took my hand when he saw the familiar panicked look come into my eyes. He was developing an uncanny ability to sense when I was turning skittish. I sighed and stayed where I was. It should probably have bothered me more that I was such a slave to this child\u0027s wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things?\" Doc asked in a casual voice, sliding onto the counter next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan, a few feet down from us, turned his body so it looked like he was part of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We boiled soup today,\" Jamie announced. \"My eyes are still stinging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc held up a pair of bright red hands. \"Soap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie laughed. \"You win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc gave a mocking bow from the waist, then turned to me. \"Wanda, I had a question for you...\" He let the words trail off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was wondering... Of all the different planets you\u0027re familiar with, which species is physically the closest to humankind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just good old-fashioned biological curiosity. I guess I\u0027ve been thinking about your Healers... Where do they get the knowledge to cure, rather than just treat symptoms, as you said?\" Doc was speaking louder than necessary, his mild voice carrying farther than usual. Several people looked up-Trudy and Geoffrey, Lily, Walter...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms tightly around myself, trying to take up less space. \"Those are two different questions,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc smiled and gestured with one hand for me to proceed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie squeezed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"The Bears on the Mists Planet, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the claw beasts?\" Jamie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are they similar?\" Doc prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, feeling Jeb\u0027s direction in this, but continued. \"They\u0027re close to mammals in many ways. Fur, warm-blooded. Their blood isn\u0027t exactly the same as yours, but it does essentially the same job. They have similar emotions, the same need for societal interaction and creative outlets -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Creative?\" Doc leaned forward, fascinated-or feigning fascination. \"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jamie. \"You know. Why don\u0027t you tell Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might get it wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Doc, who nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, see, they have these awesome hands.\" Jamie was enthusiastic almost immediately. \"Sort of double-jointed-they can curl both ways.\" He flexed his own fingers, as if trying to bend them backward. \"One side is soft, like my palm, but the other side is like razors! They cut the ice-ice sculpting. They make cities that are all crystal castles that never melt! It\u0027s beautiful, isn\u0027t it, Wanda?\" He turned to me for backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"They see a different range of colors-the ice is full of rainbows. Their cities are a point of pride for them. They\u0027re always trying to make them more beautiful. I knew of one Bear who we called... well, something like Glitter Weaver, but it sounds better in that language, because of the way the ice seemed to know what he wanted and shaped itself into his dreams. I met him once and saw his creations. That\u0027s one of my most beautiful memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They dream?\" Ian asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled wryly. \"Not as vividly as humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do your Healers get their knowledge about the physiology of a new species? They came to this planet prepared. I watched it start-watched the terminal patients walk out of the hospital whole...\" A frown etched a V-shaped crease into Doc\u0027s narrow forehead. He hated the invaders, like everyone, but unlike the others, he also envied them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to answer. Everyone was listening to us by this point, and this was no pretty fairytale about ice-sculpting Bears. This was the story of their defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc waited, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They... they take samples,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan grinned in understanding. \"Alien abductions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc pursed his lips. \"Makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence in the room reminded me of my first time here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did your kind begin?\" Doc asked. \"Do you remember? I mean, as a species, do you know how you evolved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Origin,\" I answered, nodding. \"We still live there. It\u0027s where I was... born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s kind of special,\" Jamie added. \"It\u0027s rare to meet someone from the Origin, isn\u0027t it? Most souls try to stay there, right, Wanda?\" He didn\u0027t wait for my response. I was beginning to regret answering his questions so thoroughly each night. \"So when someone moves on, it makes them almost... like a celebrity? Or like a member of a royal family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel my cheeks getting warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a cool place,\" Jamie went on. \"Lots of clouds, with a bunch of different-colored layers. It\u0027s the only planet where the souls can live outside of a host for very long. The hosts on the Origin planet are really pretty, too, with sort of wings and lots of tentacles and big silver eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc was leaning forward with his face in his hands. \"Do they remember how the host-parasite relationship was formed? How did the colonization begin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie looked at me, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were always that way,\" I answered slowly, still unwilling. \"As far back as we were intelligent enough to know ourselves, at least. We were discovered by another species-the Vultures, we call them here, though more for their personalities than for their looks. They were... not kind. Then we discovered that we could bond with them just as we had with our original hosts. Once we controlled them, we made use of their technology. We took their planet first, and then followed them to the Dragon Planet and the Summer World-lovely places where the Vultures had also not been kind. We started colonizing; our hosts reproduced so much slower than we did, and their life spans were short. We began exploring farther into the universe...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trailed off, conscious of the many eyes on my face. Only Sharon continued to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak of it almost as if you were there,\" Ian noted quietly. \"How long ago did this happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After dinosaurs lived here but before you did. I was not there, but I remember some of what my mother\u0027s mother\u0027s mother remembered of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\" Ian asked, leaning toward me, his brilliant blue eyes penetrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know in Earth years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An estimate?\" he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands of years, maybe.\" I shrugged. \"I lose track of the years spent in hibernation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan leaned back, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, that\u0027s old,\" Jamie breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But in a very real sense, I\u0027m younger than you,\" I murmured to him. \"Not even a year old. I feel like a child all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s lips pulled up slightly at the corners. He liked the idea of being more mature than I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the aging process for your kind?\" Doc asked. \"The natural life span?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have one,\" I told him. \"As long as we have a healthy host, we can live forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low murmur-angry? frightened? disgusted? I couldn\u0027t tell-swirled around the edges of the cave. I saw that my answer had been unwise; I understood what these words would mean to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beautiful.\" The low, furious word came from Sharon\u0027s direction, but she hadn\u0027t turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie squeezed my hand, seeing again in my eyes the desire to bolt. This time I gently pulled my hand free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not hungry anymore,\" I whispered, though my bread sat barely touched on the counter beside me. I hopped down and, hugging the wall, made my escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie followed right behind me. He caught up to me in the big garden plaza and handed me the remains of my bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was real interesting, honest,\" he told me. \"I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s too upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeb put Doc up to this, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell good stories. Once everyone knows that, they\u0027ll want to hear them. Just like me and Jeb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I don\u0027t want to tell them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie frowned. \"Well, I guess then... you shouldn\u0027t. But it seems like you don\u0027t mind telling me stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s different. You like me.\" I could have said, You don\u0027t want to kill me, but the implications would have upset him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once people get to know you, they\u0027ll all like you. Ian and Doc do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian and Doc do not like me, Jamie. They\u0027re just morbidly curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh,\" I groaned. We were to our room by now. I shoved the screen aside and threw myself onto the mattress. Jamie sat down less forcefully beside me and looped his arms around his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be mad,\" he pleaded. \"Jeb means well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t be so bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc\u0027s going to do this every time I go in the kitchen, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie nodded sheepishly. \"Or Ian. Or Jeb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and rolled onto my stomach. \"Does Jeb have to get his way every single time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie thought for a moment, then nodded. \"Pretty much, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a big bite of bread. When I was done chewing, I said, \"I think I\u0027ll eat in here from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian\u0027s going to ask you questions tomorrow when you\u0027re weeding the spinach. Jeb\u0027s not making him-he wants to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re pretty good with sarcasm. I thought the parasites-I mean the souls-didn\u0027t like negative humor. Just the happy stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d learn pretty quick in here, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie laughed and then took my hand. \"You don\u0027t hate it here, do you? You\u0027re not miserable, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis big chocolate-colored eyes were troubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed his hand to my face. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I told him, and at that moment, it was entirely the truth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-26.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
