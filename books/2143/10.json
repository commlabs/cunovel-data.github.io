I met Becky by our lockers and, after Matt gave her a quick peck before soccer practice, we were off to her house for a prom fashion show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky resided on what many of the snotty Dullsvillians called the \"wrong side of the tracks.\" I, however, thought she had primo real estate. Becky\u0027s backyard was twice the size of Trevor\u0027s and sported sweet apple trees instead of unused Jacuzzis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer farmhouse, built in the 1930s, was the original house her father grew up in. In back of the house, next to the five-acre apple orchard, stood a monstrous silo with vines clinging to it like a giant spiderweb. Adjacent to that sat a red barn filled with tools and a loft suitable for telling ghost stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky\u0027s house was also steeped in character, something lacking in many of the \"right side of the trackers\u0027\" houses, including mine. The wooden house was pale yellow with hunter green shutters. It had screen doors and a stellar wraparound porch with an old-fashioned porch swing. Though some of the appliances had been updated, the original yellow flowered wallpaper from her father\u0027s youth remained. A round vinyl booth instead of the typical dinette table and chairs was sandwiched in a kitchen alcove. Black-and-white tiles lined the upstairs bathroom walls and floors. Glass doorknobs glistened on all the doors, instead of brass or pewter ones, and hardwood floors ran throughout the first floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked up the squeaky wooden staircase to her bedroom. One wall was slanted, making it feel as if her movie star posters were going to reach out and kiss you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky pulled out a wedge that kept her closet door shut. Depending on the weather, the door buckled and wouldn\u0027t remain closed, which provided hours of fun for us when we were kids, imagining her room was haunted. She took out a garment bag, unzipping it to reveal a vintage floor-length blue strapless gown. \"It\u0027s gorgeous!\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched through Becky\u0027s jewelry box while she tried on her dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best friend had transformed into a princess right in front of my eyes. \"You look beautiful. Matt is going to drop dead when he sees you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I wear my hair up in a twist?\" she asked, pulling her layered locks off her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know much about hair,\" I said. \"If it were me, I\u0027d streak it blue to match the dress. But I think the way you have it up looks fabulous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next hour we finalized her jewelry selection (faux pearl earrings and matching necklace) and shades of makeup (coral blush, passion pink lipstick with matching gloss, and indigo blue eye shadow).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I were starving, so on the drive to my home, we stopped off at Hatsy\u0027s Diner, where we stuffed our faces with cheese fries and Vanilla Cokes and talked nonstop about our heartthrobs. Since my best friend and I had acquired boyfriends, we hadn\u0027t had the time to be as glued to each other as we had been in the past. Now that we had recharged our batteries, we got in some major girl time and gossiped for hours. She finally dropped me off after sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the front door to find the first floor empty of family members and the phone ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it,\" I hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my backpack on the kitchen counter and picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Raven,\" Alexander said from the other end. My name rolled off his tongue like smooth chocolate dairy soft serve being licked off a spoon. \"How was your day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same as every day--dreadful until sunset,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that kept me going through the day was knowing that atop Benson Hill was the most handsome guy I\u0027d ever seen, my very own vampire-mate, sleeping in a coffin in the dusty attic of a creepy old mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I meet you at the Mansion or are you going to pick me up?\" I asked eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence on Alexander\u0027s end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate to do this to you...,\" he said, his voice suddenly serious, \"but I have to cancel tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cancel?\" It hit me like a closing coffin lid. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jameson has the car...and I want to check out the cave and cemetery for Valentine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can ask my mom to drop me off instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to do it alone,\" Alexander said in a grave tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander didn\u0027t respond. I knew he didn\u0027t want to put me in harm\u0027s way again, but that didn\u0027t mean I had to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only would I be missing a nocturnal adventure, I\u0027d be missing precious time with Alexander. It was bad enough I had to be away from Alexander in the sunlight; I couldn\u0027t face being away from him in the moonlight, too. \"I\u0027ll make it up to you,\" he said in a bright voice. \"I still haven\u0027t given you the surprise I was going to give you at the cave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next five minutes I tried whining, protesting, and attempting my tried-and-true manipulation tactics, but nothing worked. Alexander put his foot down, before he put the phone down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I tried arguing with my mother, but she wouldn\u0027t let me borrow the car. I figured if I used Billy Boy\u0027s bike, which had thicker tires than mine, I could meet Alexander at the cemetery before he started for the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on my brother\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away!\" I heard my annoying brother say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to ask you for a favor,\" I said sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m busy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly cracked open the door. My brother\u0027s normally bright room was dark, except for a single desk lamp gently illuminating the room. He was sitting at his computer desk typing away on his keyboard with one hand and holding a gravestone etching in the other. To my surprise, there was someone sitting in a chair next to him--and it wasn\u0027t Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. Seated next to Billy Boy was a slightly smaller boy with powder white hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in slow motion, the vampire boy turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo glassy green eyes stared through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine looked like he\u0027d been dead for more years than he\u0027d been alive. He had a sullen, cadaverous, and almost handsome ghost white complexion, with soft bloodred lips. His long white shaggy hair hung over his face. He exuded an inner strength and, at the same time, a hint of frailty. Though he was only three-fourths my size and seemed like he could blow over with a gentle breeze, something told me he had the power to withstand the force of a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in here?\" my brother asked, rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t invite you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to speak with you,\" I said sternly in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine\u0027s eyes bored through me. Chills ran down my spine like tiny jabbing icicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out. I have company,\" my brother ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy charged toward me. He braced the door with his skinny arms and tried to close it. I stopped it with my combat boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he doing here?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s spending the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skidded to a stop. Spending the night? My brother obviously didn\u0027t realize who--or what--he\u0027d invited to share his bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t stay here,\" I warned softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t tell you when Becky can come over. Since when did you become my mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Henry?\" I asked, stalling. \"Shouldn\u0027t you have invited him, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s staying at his grandmother\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at Valentine, whose green eyes glistened at me hypnotically. He licked his lips, and the light of the desk lamp shined on a small fang. Like a million strobe lights going off in my head, I realized why Valentine must have come to Dullsville. Jagger and Luna weren\u0027t seeking revenge on Alexander anymore--they were seeking revenge on me by threatening my family. And they were sending Valentine to do their bloody work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit nosing around,\" Billy Boy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a life!\" he yelled as only a little brother could, and slammed the door in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy didn\u0027t know Valentine was trying to get a life, too-- his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced in my bedroom, my combat boots slamming against the black-carpeted floor, while holding my hissing kitten, who was clearly uptight about our new neighbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to come up with a plan. Alexander was miles away and I wasn\u0027t even certain of his location. Unfortunately he never carried a cell phone. I wouldn\u0027t be able to inform him that the very person he was searching for was right here underneath my very own roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. I tried to rack my brain for a strategy. I couldn\u0027t leave the house with a vengeful vampire in my brother\u0027s bedroom. However, my parents would think I had inhaled glue if I ran downstairs and calmly explained to them that Billy Boy had mistakenly invited over a bloodthirsty descendant of Dracula instead of a new-to-town tween in need of a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d have to face this problem head-on. I found my mother in the kitchen placing a plastic tablecloth over our dinette table. \"Mom, we need to talk. That friend of Billy Boy\u0027s--he can\u0027t stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word on the street is he\u0027s trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your concern, but I\u0027m not worried about an eleven-year-old boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We barely know this kid. He\u0027s a stranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s there to know? He seems delightful and very charming. I think it\u0027s good for Billy to widen his circle of friends. He\u0027s coming out of his shell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy would be coming out of more than just a shell if Valentine stayed. He could be coming out of a coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind setting the table?\" she asked as she filled a plastic cup with ice from the door of the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed plastic silverware and paper plates from our pantry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis game wasn\u0027t over. I wasn\u0027t ready to fold. I had no choice. I had to show my cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ice maker roared thunderously as my mom filled another cup with ice. I put my hand on the granite countertop and leaned in to my mother. \"Valentine thinks he is a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked, placing the cup on the countertop and beginning to fill another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valentine thinks he\u0027s a vampire,\" I said louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t hear you.\" I placed my hand over the cup. A few cubes bounced off my knuckles and flew to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valentine has to leave. He thinks he\u0027s a vampire,\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom paused. Then she laughed, picked up the fallen cubes, and threw them into the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he should be friends with you, not Billy,\" she remarked playfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Serious?\" she asked. \"Am I talking to the same person I raised, who at five years old wore a black cape around the house because you were imitating Count Dracula? Who at nine insisted on drinking only raspberry Kool-Aid because you thought it resembled blood? And who, just a few days ago, bought a prom dress that resembles a vampire\u0027s bridal outfit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open. Touch\u0026amp;#65533;. My mother\u0027s straight flush beat my full house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s wonderful that Billy Boy is accepting someone who is different from himself,\" she continued. \"Someone who reminds him of his sister. I\u0027d think you would be flattered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom grabbed a twenty lying on the kitchen counter, and I followed her to the front door. \"The pizzas are here!\" she called upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy raced down the stairs, Valentine slowly trailing after him like a ghostly shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine stood on the stairs, his black painted fingernails tapping against the wooden banister. He was intently fixated on me, grinning like a gothic Dennis the Menace. I glared back at the four- foot ten-inch vampire as Billy grabbed the pizzas and my mother paid the delivery woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine deliberately brushed by me, sending an icy chill through my body as the two boys flew into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed a soda from the table and sat down next to my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy shot me an odd look. \"What are you doing here? Don\u0027t you have a hot date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I did, I wouldn\u0027t tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys each grabbed a slice of pizza, scarfing it down before it had time to hit their paper plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose and opened the refrigerator door. \"Want some garlic with that?\" I asked Valentine, holding up a clove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if all the blood had drained from Valentine\u0027s already pale face. He laid the crust on his plate and sat back in his chair. \"Uh...no, thank you. I\u0027m deathly allergic to garlic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? So is Raven\u0027s boyfriend,\" my mother said. \"Raven, put that back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly I returned the clove to the crisper and washed my hands in the kitchen sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine glared at me as his morosely ashen complexion turned back to ghostly white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, take another slice,\" my mom said, kindly handing Valentine more pizza. He returned to wolfing down his dinner like he hadn\u0027t eaten in centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wiped his tomato-sauce-stained mouth with a napkin and guzzled a soda just like any mortal his age. It was odd to see a boy so young have the potential to be so dangerous. My eyes were glued to him, making sure all he bit into was the pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you visiting or did you move here?\" my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Visiting. But I really like this town,\" he said, looking straight at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you visiting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...my aunt, but you wouldn\u0027t know her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this town? We know everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, who is she?\" I questioned. \"I\u0027d love to meet her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us eat,\" Billy Boy said. \"We\u0027re hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, go ahead,\" my mother said in an apologetic voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys continued to shovel in their pizza while I observed their every bite. For once in my life, I was the one gawking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are creeping me out,\" my brother finally said, scooting away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven, let\u0027s go in the other room,\" my mother instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed our plates of half-eaten pizza and we sat in the dining room. All the while I spied on Valentine, keeping my peripheral vision set on the pizza-partying vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated that Billy Boy no longer wanted the Madison women hovering around him. He should have listened to me about Valentine. He was beginning to remind me of someone who didn\u0027t take orders, someone I knew very well--me. Later that evening, while Mom and Dad were downstairs watching TV, I made believe I was folding towels in the hall closet while Valentine brushed his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door finally opened and Valentine emerged. He was smiling, his green eyes sparkling, seemingly relaxed in his new environment, until he spotted me in the hallway. Then he glared up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you make sure to floss between your fangs?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, tell your parents,\" he challenged. \"I\u0027ll tell them about Alexander,\" he whispered back, then disappeared into my brother\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped into the bathroom. Mom\u0027s makeup mirror was facing the wall, and a lavender bath towel was haphazardly placed over the sink mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear my mother whistling as she ascended the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly retrieved the towel and threw it into the wicker hamper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lights out, boys,\" my mom ordered, holding a handful of catalogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, leave the lights on!\" I shouted, running into my brother\u0027s room. I was hoping an illuminated bedroom would keep Valentine at a safe distance from my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two boys looked at me strangely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other night, Billy Boy thought he saw a bat,\" I explained. \"I want him to get a good night\u0027s rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother\u0027s nerdy white face turned bloodred. I almost felt sorry I\u0027d embarrassed him in front of his friend. \"Mom, get her out!\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom shooed me out of the room with her catalog collection and closed the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced in my room, wondering what Valentine was going to do all night. He obviously wasn\u0027t going to sleep. I feared at any moment he might sink his fangs into my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no choice. Valentine couldn\u0027t sleep here, especially when I knew he wouldn\u0027t be sleeping. I didn\u0027t have much time; Billy Boy would soon be defenseless. When my brother was a baby, he wailed throughout the night. Now that he was older, he fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced to my dresser drawer and stuck my container of garlic in the waistband of my skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crept over to Billy Boy\u0027s room. I took a deep breath and cracked his door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t prepared for what I saw. Valentine, his eyes closed as if in a trance, was standing over my sleeping brother, his palm resting on my brother\u0027s neck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine, startled, quickly pulled his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped. \"It was you in the cave,\" I managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine remained in place, his fists now clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re thinking...,\" he said in a challenging voice. \"I know all about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was confused. \"Know what about me? From Jagger and Luna? You can\u0027t trust what they say...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inched forward. \"You are afraid.\" \"Of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snickered. \"Of Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms skeptically. \"I love Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Valentine turned deadly serious. \"You are afraid of becoming a vampire,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jagger and Luna didn\u0027t have to tell me,\" he continued. \"I learned that from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine didn\u0027t seem to be threatened by my sleeping brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the cave,\" he continued. \"Alexander wasn\u0027t going to bite you. But you thought he was--and you freaked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you are talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Valentine drew closer, his green eyes locking on to mine in a strange hypnotic stare. \"You\u0027d imagined an elaborate and gloomy gothic covenant ceremony in the cemetery, underneath the moonlight, an antique candelabra and a pewter goblet atop a closed coffin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood frozen as the boyish Nosferatu continued to recite the very thoughts and feelings I had had last night at the cave. \"You expected to be holding a bouquet of dead roses and wearing a morbidly black sexy lace dress, which would flow behind you as you walked between the tombstones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did Valentine know what I had imagined? I could barely breathe as Valentine took another step toward me. I hadn\u0027t told anyone about my dream covenant. Valentine and Billy Boy must have rummaged through my journal-- only I didn\u0027t even remember writing about my fantasy gothic underworld wedding. \"When you thought Alexander was ready to turn you, your blood ran cold,\" Valentine charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill ran from the top of my scalp down through my spine and over the back of my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine had read my thoughts as he stood over me in the cave holding my neck. Now, in Billy Boy\u0027s bedroom, he was doing the same thing to my brother. What was he after?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is time you leave this house and this town,\" I said, reaching for my container of garlic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any pesky mortal kid, Valentine enjoyed our quarrel. \"You act big with your black nail polish and lipstick, but you could never be one of us. You don\u0027t have what it takes,\" he continued. \"And Alexander needs to know you aren\u0027t ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words hit me like a lightning bolt. \"You can\u0027t...use my thoughts against me,\" I warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or can I?\" he asked with a wicked grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy began to stir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine quickly retreated into the room\u0027s shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my brother, who remained sleeping. When I turned back, I noticed Billy Boy\u0027s window was open and Valentine was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-10.html","bookId":2143,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM"}
