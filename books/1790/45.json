She\u0027d always had such trust in him. He was still humbled by her faith. \"My God, Sara, I love you so much, it… hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe solemnly nodded. \"I can see that it does,\" she whispered. \"Are you getting seasick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"After you sign your paper, I\u0027ll sign mine,\" he stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you signing papers?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m also going to break the contract. I don\u0027t want the inheritance. I already have the greatest gift of all,\" he whispered. \"I have you.\" His smile was filled with tenderness when he added, \"You\u0027re everything I could ever want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started crying. He couldn\u0027t stop himself from pulling her into his arms. He leaned down and kissed his wife. She kissed him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA collective sigh came from the women in the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Nathan\u0027s hope that the evening would turn out to be perfect for his wife was not completely fulfilled. By the St. James family\u0027s standards it was a huge success. By everyone else\u0027s standards it was a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one, however, would ever forget the brawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began innocently enough when Nathan turned to take Sara to the library. She tugged on his hand to make him stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you love me, Nathan,\" she said when she had his full attention again. \"You don\u0027t have to give up the king\u0027s gift just to prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do,\" he returned. \"I want to show you how much I love you. It\u0027s the only way you\u0027re going to believe me. You\u0027ve given me your love for so long, and I\u0027ve given you nothing but aggravation. It\u0027s penance, Sara. I have to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, you don\u0027t have to do this. Nathan, you will show me you have faith in me and my love by not giving up the gift. You waited long years for that inheritance, and you\u0027re going to keep it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mind\u0027s made up, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unmake it,\" she countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell from the set look on his face that he was determined to make a noble sacrifice for her. She was just as determined not to let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I don\u0027t sign my paper?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her arms in front of her and frowned up at him while she waited for his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear heaven, how she loved him, she thought. And how he loved her, too. He looked like he wanted to throttle her. She felt like laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t sign the paper, Sara, then your family can have the king\u0027s gift. I don\u0027t want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Sara…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t realize they were shouting. She did. She turned to look over the St. James section of the crowd until she found the man she wanted. \"Uncle Dunnford?\" she called out. \"Nathan wants to give up the king\u0027s gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell, Sara, why\u0027d you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around and smiled at her husband. Nathan was already taking his jacket off. Then Sara noticed Caine and Colin were doing the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to laugh. God help her, she\u0027d already turned into a St. James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan didn\u0027t look sick anymore. A sparkle had come into his eyes. He was such a fit man. And she was just the woman to manage him. He was glaring at her chest. Then his jacket was around her shoulders, and he was demanding that she put her arms through the sleeves. \"If you ever wear that gown again, I\u0027ll tear it off you,\" he whispered. \"Hell, here they come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe St. James men were moving forward like a troop of soldiers set on war. \"I love you, Nathan. Do remember not to tuck your thumb under your fingers. You wouldn\u0027t want to break it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan raised an eyebrow over that suggestion. She retaliated by giving him a slow, sexy wink. He grabbed her by the lapels of his jacket, kissed her hard, and then pushed her behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, without a doubt, a night to remember. The duke and duchess of Farnmount, both surely in their late sixties, couldn\u0027t have been more pleased with the entertainment. Their little gathering would provide enough talk to keep everyone well fed in the gossip department for a good long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara remembered seeing the stately couple perched on the top step. They each held a goblet of wine, and after the first punch was landed the duke of Farnmount directed the orchestra to begin playing a waltz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, however, Sara liked the aftermath much better than the brawl. As soon as the fight was over Nathan dragged her out into the night. He didn\u0027t want to waste time taking her back to the ship, and so he took her back to Caine\u0027s and Jade\u0027s townhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was frantic to touch her. She was just as frantic to let him. Their lovemaking was passionate, wild, and filled with love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara was sprawled on top of her husband in the center of the bed. Her chin was propped on top of her folded hands, and she was staring down into his beautiful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked thoroughly content. He was gently rubbing her backside in a haphazard way. Now that they were all alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was able to tell her how much he loved her without turning gray at all. He was a bit of a romantic. He opened the drawer of the table next to the bed, pulled out a piece of paper, and handed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick out the ones you like,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chose \"sweetheart,\" \"my love,\" and \"my sweet\" from the list of endearments on the sheet. Nathan promised to memorize them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to be a little envious of Jade,\" she told him. \"I didn\u0027t think I could ever be like her, and my staff kept making comparisons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to be like anyone else,\" he whispered. \"Your love has given me such strength, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned up to kiss her. \"I have come to rely on your love. It became my anchor. It was the one certainty I had, and it took me a long while to realize it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will it take for you to have complete faith in me?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have complete faith in you,\" he argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you tell me all about your past?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked a little wary now. \"In time,\" he finally agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"It would only upset you, sweetheart. I\u0027ve led a rather black life. I\u0027ve done a few things you might consider… worrisome. I think it would be better if I just tell you one story at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it is only out of consideration for my tender feelings that you hesitate to tell me about your past?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were some of these things… illegal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband looked highly uncomfortable. \"Some would say they were,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took all she had not to laugh. \"I\u0027m happy you\u0027re so concerned about my feelings, husband, and now I know you only hesitate to tell me about your past because I might worry, and not because you think I might accidentally blurt out anything of significance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sparkle that came into her eyes puzzled him. She was up to something, but he couldn\u0027t imagine what it could be. He wrapped his arms around her waist and let out a loud, satisfied yawn. He closed his eyes. \"I know you love me,\" he whispered. \"And in time—say five or ten years, my love—I\u0027ll tell you everything. By then you should have become accustomed to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did laugh then. He was still a little scared. Oh, she knew he trusted her, knew he loved her, but it was all so new for Nathan, and it was going to take him time to rid himself of all his shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have any such problems, of course. She\u0027d loved him for the longest time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan blew out the candle and nuzzled his wife\u0027s ear. \"I love you, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too, Pagan.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-45.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
