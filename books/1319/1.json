{"id":10798,"no":1,"title":"INTRODUCTION","content":"The present romance, the second in the Mysterious Island triad, was originally issued in Paris with the title of L\u0027Abandonné. Jules Verne\u0027s list of stories already ran then to some twenty volumes—a number which has since grown to almost Dumasien proportions. L\u0027Abandonné, like its two companion tales, ran its course as a serial through the Magasin Illustré of education and recreation, before its issue as a boy\u0027s story-book. Its success in both forms seems to have established a record in the race for popularity and a circulation in both the French and English fields of current literature. The present book was translated into English by the late W. H. G. Kingston; and is printed in Everyman\u0027s Library by special exclusive arrangement with Messrs. Sampson Low, Marston \u0026amp; Co., Ltd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1909\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1495/44674.html","bookId":1319,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:24:24 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:24:24 AM"}
