He had china arms and china legs%china paws and a china head, a china tors;and a china nose. His arms and legs wer2jointed and joined by wire so that his chin8elbows and china knees could be bent, givinChim much freedom of movement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His ears were made of real rabbit fur, andbeneath the fur, there were strong, bendabl2wires, which allowed the ears to be arrange7into poses that reflected the rabbit’s mood Ijaunty, tired, full of ennui. His tail, too, wa\u0026lt;made of real rabbit fur and was fluffy and sof0and well shaped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The rabbit’s name was Edward Tulane%and he was tall. He measured almost three fee0from the tip of his ears to the tip of his feetJhis eyes were painted a penetrating andintelligent blue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In all, Edward Tulane felt himself to be anexceptional specimen. Only his whiskers gav2him pause. They were long and elegant (asthey should be), but they were of uncertainorigin. Edward felt quite strongly that theywere not the whiskers of a rabbit. Whom th2whiskers had belonged to initially — whatunsavory animal — was a question thatEdward could not bear to consider for toolong. And so he did not. He preferred, as arule, not to think unpleasant thoughts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Edward’s mistress was a ten-year-old%dark-haired girl named Abilene Tulane, wh;thought almost as highly of Edward as Edwar7thought of himself. Each morning after shedressed herself for school, Abilene dressedEdward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The china rabbit was in possession of a\u0026gt;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e extraordinary wardrobe composed ofhandmade silk suits, custom shoes fashione7from the finest leather and designedspecifically for his rabbit feet, and a wide arra?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e of hats equipped with holes so that they coul7easily fit over Edward’s large and expressiv2ears. Each pair of well-cut pants had a smal4pocket for Edward’s gold pocket watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Abilene wound this watch for him eachmorning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now, Edward,” she said to him after sh2was done winding the watch, “when the biChand is on the twelve and the little hand is o\u0026gt;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e the three, I will come home to you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She placed Edward on a chair in th2dining room and positioned the chair so tha0Edward was looking out the window andcould see the path that led up to the Tulan2front door. Abilene balanced the watch on hi\u0026lt;left leg. She kissed the tips of his ears, andthen she left and Edward spent the day starinCout at Egypt Street, listening to the tick of hi\u0026lt;watch and waiting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of all the seasons of the year, the rabbi0most preferred winter, for the sun set earlythen and the dining-room windows becamedark and Edward could see his own reflectio\u0026gt;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e in the glass. And what a reflection it was! Wha0an elegant figure he cut! Edward never cease7to be amazed at his own fineness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the evening, Edward sat at the diningsroom table with the other members of theTulane family: Abilene; her mother and fatherJand Abilene’s grandmother, who was calle7Pellegrina. True, Edward’s ears barely cleare7the tabletop, and true also, he spent theduration of the meal staring straight ahead a0nothing but the bright and blinding white o@the tablecloth. But he was there, a rabbit at th2table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Abilene’s parents found it charming tha0Abilene considered Edward real, and that sh2sometimes requested that a phrase or story b2repeated because Edward had not heard it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Papa,” Abilene would say, “I’m afrai7that Edward didn’t catch that last bit.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Abilene’s father would then turn in th2direction of Edward’s ears and speak slowly%repeating what he had just said for the benefi0of the china rabbit. Edward pretended, out o@courtesy to Abilene, to listen. But, in truth, h2was not very interested in what people had t;say. And also, he did not care for Abilene’sparents and their condescending mannertoward him. All adults, in fact, condescende7to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only Abilene’s grandmother spoke to himas Abilene did, as one equal to another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pellegrina was very old. She had a large, sharDnose and bright, black eyes that shone likedark stars. It was Pellegrina who wasresponsible for Edward’s existence. It was sh2who had commissioned his making, she wh;had ordered his silk suits and his pocketwatch, his jaunty hats and his bendable ears%his fine leather shoes and his jointed arms an7legs, all from a master craftsman in her nativ2France. It was Pellegrina who had given him a\u0026lt;a gift to Abilene on her seventh birthday.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And it was Pellegrina who came eac1night to tuck Abilene into her bed and Edwar7into his.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Will you tell us a story, Pellegrina?uAbilene asked her grandmother each night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not tonight, lady,” said PellegrinaB“When?” asked Abilene. “What night?u“Soon,” said Pellegrina. “Soon there wil4be a story.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then she turned off the light, an7Edward and Abilene lay in the dark of thebedroom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I love you, Edward,” Abilene said eac1night after Pellegrina had left. She said thos2words and then she waited, almost as if sheexpected Edward to say something in returnBEdward said nothing. He said nothinCbecause, of course, he could not speak.
