Stop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles a little and says, “I’m doing this for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes the knife in farther, slow, and blood stains the hem of his shirt. I gag, and throw myself against the bonds holding me to the table. “No, stop!” I thrash and in a simulation I would have pulled free by now so this must mean that this is real, it’s real. I scream and he sticks the knife in to the handle. He collapses to the floor and his blood spills fast and surrounds him. The shadow-birds turn their beady eyes on him and swarm in a tornado of wings and talons, pecking at his skin. I see his eyes through the whirling feathers and he is still awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bird lands on the fingers that hold the knife. He draws it out again and it clatters to the ground and I should hope that he is dead but I’m selfish so I can’t. My back lifts from the table and all my muscles clench and my throat aches from this scream that no longer shapes itself into words and will not stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sedative,” a stern voice commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother needle in my neck, and my heart begins to slow down. I sob with relief. For seconds all I can do is sob with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not fear. That was something else; an emotion that should not exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me go,” Tobias says, and he sounds scratchier than before. I blink fast so I can see him through my tears. There are red marks on his arms from where the Dauntless traitors held him back, but he is not dying; he is all right. “That’s the only way I’ll tell you, is if you let me go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanine nods, and he runs to me. He wraps one hand around mine and touches my hair with the other. His fingertips come away wet with tears. He doesn’t wipe them off. He leans over and presses his forehead to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The factionless safe houses,” he says dully, right against my cheek. “Get me a map and I’ll mark them for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forehead feels cool and dry against mine. My muscles ache, probably from being clenched for however long Jeanine left me with that serum pulsing through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls back, his fingers wrapped around my fingers for as long as they can be until the Dauntless traitors pull him from my grasp to escort him elsewhere. My hand falls heavy on the table. I don’t want to struggle against the restraints anymore. All I want to do is sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While you’re here . . .” Jeanine says once Tobias and his escorts are gone. She looks up and focuses her watery eyes on one of the Erudite. “Get him and bring him in here. It’s time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks back down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While you sleep, we will be performing a short procedure to observe a few things about your brain. It will not be invasive. But before that . . . I promised you full transparency with these procedures. So I feel it’s only fair that you know exactly who has been assisting me in my endeavors.” She smiles a little. “Who told me what three factions you had an aptitude for, and what our best chance was to get you to come here, and to put your mother in the last simulation to make it more effective.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks toward the doorway as the sedative sets in, making everything blur at the edges. I look over my shoulder, and through the haze of drugs I see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WAKE TO a headache. I try to go back to sleep—at least when I’m asleep, I’m calm—but the image of Caleb standing in the doorway runs through my mind over and over again, accompanied by the sound of squawking crows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I never wonder how Eric and Jeanine knew that I had aptitude for three factions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did it never occur to me that only three people in the world knew that particular fact: Tori, Caleb, and Tobias?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head pounds. I can’t make sense of it. I don’t know why Caleb would betray me. I wonder when it happened—after the attack simulation? After the escape from Amity? Or was it earlier than that—was it back when my father was still alive? Caleb told us he left Erudite when he found out what they were planning—was he lying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have been. I press the heel of my hand to my forehead. My brother chose faction over blood. There has to be a reason. She must have threatened him. Or coerced him in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens. I don’t lift my head or open my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stiff.” It’s Peter. Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” When I let my hand fall from my face, a lock of hair falls with it. I look at it from the corner of my eye. My hair has never been this greasy before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter sets a bottle of water next to the bed, and a sandwich. The thought of eating it nauseates me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You brain-dead?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be so sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha-ha,” I say. “How long have I been asleep?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About a day. I’m supposed to escort you to the showers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you say something about how badly I need one,” I say tiredly, “I will poke you in the eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room spins when I lift my head, but I manage to put my legs over the edge of the bed and stand. Peter and I start down the hallway. When we turn the corner to get to the bathroom, though, there are people at the end of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them is Tobias. I can see where our paths will intersect, between where I stand now and my cell door. I stare, not at him but at where he will be when he reaches for my hand, as he did the last time we passed each other. My skin tingles with anticipation. For just a moment, I will touch him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix steps until we pass each other. Five steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt four steps, though, Tobias stops. His entire body goes limp, catching his Dauntless traitor escort off guard. The guard loses his grip on him for just a second, and Tobias crumples to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he twists around. Lurches forward. And grabs a gun from the shorter Dauntless traitor’s holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun goes off. Peter dives to the right, dragging me with him. My head skims the wall. The Dauntless guard’s mouth is open—he must be screaming. I can’t hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias kicks him hard in the stomach. The Dauntless in me admires his form—perfect—and his speed—incredible. Then he turns, training the gun on Peter. But Peter has already released me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias reaches for my left arm, helps me to my feet, and starts running. I stumble after him. Each time my foot hits the ground, pain slices into my head, but I can’t stop. I blink tears from my eyes. Run, I tell myself, as if that will make it easier. Tobias’s hand is rough and strong. I let it guide me around a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tobias,” I wheeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops, and looks back at me. “Oh no,” he says, brushing my cheek with his fingers. “Come on. On my back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bends, and I put my arms around his neck, burying my face between his shoulder blades. He lifts me without difficulty and holds on to my leg with his left hand. His right hand still holds the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs, and even with my weight, he is fast. Idly I think, How could he ever have been Abnegation? He seems designed specifically for speed and deadly accuracy. But not strength, not particularly—he is smart, but not strong. Only strong enough to carry me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallways are empty now, but not for long. Soon every Dauntless in the building will rush toward us from every angle, and we will be trapped in this pale maze. I wonder how Tobias plans to get past them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head long enough to see that he just ran past an exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tobias, you missed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Missed . . . what?” he says between breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An exit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not trying to escape. We’d get shot if we did,” he says. “Trying to . . . find something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would suspect that I’m dreaming if the pain in my head wasn’t so intense. Usually only my dreams make this little sense. Why, if he was not trying to escape, did he take me with him? And what is he doing, if not escaping?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops abruptly, almost dropping me, as he reaches a wide hallway with panes of glass on either side, revealing offices. The Erudite sit frozen at their desks, staring at us. Tobias pays no attention to them; his eyes, as far as I can tell, are fixed on the door at the end of the corridor. A sign outside the door says CONTROL-A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias searches every corner of the room, and then shoots at the camera attached to the ceiling on our right. The camera drops. He shoots at the camera attached to the ceiling on our left. Its lens shatters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time to get down,” he says. “No more running, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide off his back and take his hand instead. He walks toward a closed door that we passed already, and into a supply closet. He shuts the door and wedges a busted chair under the doorknob. I face him, a shelf stacked with paper at my back. Above us, the blue light flickers. His eyes roam over my face almost hungrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have much time, so I’m going to be direct,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t come here on some suicide mission,” he says. “I came for two reasons. The first was to find Erudite’s two central control rooms so that when we invade, we’ll know what to destroy first to get rid of all the simulation data, so she can’t activate the Dauntless’s transmitters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat explains the running without escaping. And we found a control room, at the end of that hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, still dazed from the past few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The second,” he says, clearing his throat, “is to make sure you hold on, because we have a plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“According to one of our insiders, your execution is tentatively scheduled for two weeks from today,” he says. “At least, that’s Jeanine’s target date for the new, Divergent-proof simulation. So fourteen days from now, the factionless, the loyal Dauntless, and the Abnegation who are willing to fight will storm the Erudite compound and take out their best weapon—their computer system. That means we’ll outnumber the traitor Dauntless, and therefore the Erudite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you told Jeanine where the factionless safe houses were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” He frowns a little. “That is problematic. But as you and I know, a lot of the factionless are Divergent, and many of them were already moving toward the Abnegation sector when I left, so only some of the safe houses will be affected. So they will still have a huge population to contribute to the invasion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks. Will I be able to make it through two weeks of this? I am already so tired I’m finding it difficult to stand on my own. Even the rescue that Tobias is proposing barely appeals to me. I don’t want freedom. I want sleep. I want this to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t . . .” I choke on the words and start to cry. “I can’t . . . make it . . . that long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris,” he says sternly. He never coddles me. I wish that, just this once, he would coddle me. “You have to. You have to survive this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” The question forms in my stomach and launches from my throat like a moan. I feel like thumping my fists against his chest, like a child throwing a tantrum. Tears cover my cheeks, and I know I’m acting ridiculous but I can’t stop. “Why do I have to? Why can’t someone else do something for once? What if I don’t want to do this anymore?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what this is, I realize, is life. I don’t want it. I want my parents and I have for weeks. I’ve been trying to claw my way back to them, and now I am so close and he is telling me not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” I have never heard his voice sound so soft. “I know it’s hard. The hardest thing you’ve had to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t force you. I can’t make you want to survive this.” He pulls me against him and runs his hand over my hair, tucking it behind my ear. His fingers trail down my neck and over my shoulder, and he says, “But you will do it. It doesn’t matter if you believe you can or not. You will, because that’s who you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back and fit my mouth to his, not gently, not hesitantly. I kiss him like I used to, when I felt sure of us, and run my hands over his back, down his arms, like I used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to tell him the truth: that he is wrong, and I do not want to survive this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens. Dauntless traitors crowd into the supply closet. Tobias steps back, turns the gun in his hand, and offers it, handle first, to the nearest Dauntless traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“BEATRICE.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerk awake. The room I am in now—for whatever experiment they want to run on me—is large, with screens along the back wall and blue lights glowing just above the floor and rows of padded benches across the middle. I’m sitting on the farthest bench back with Peter at my left shoulder, my head leaning against the wall. I still can’t seem to get enough sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I wish I hadn’t woken up. Caleb stands a few feet away, his weight on one foot, an uncertain posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you ever leave Erudite?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that simple,” he starts. “I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is that simple.” I want to yell, but instead my voice comes out flat. “At what point did you betray our family? Before our parents died, or after?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did what I had to do. You think you understand this, Beatrice, but you don’t. This whole situation . . . it’s much bigger than you think it is.” His eyes plead with me to understand, but I recognize his tone—it’s the one he employed when we were younger, to scold me. It is condescending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrogance is one of the flaws in the Erudite heart—I know. It is often in mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut greed is the other. And I do not have that. So I am halfway in and halfway out, as always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself to my feet. “You still haven’t answered my question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb steps back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t about Erudite; it’s about everyone. All the factions,” he says, “and the city. And what’s outside the fence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care,” I say, but that isn’t true. The phrase “outside the fence” prickles in my brain. Outside? How could any of this have to do with what’s outside? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurgent-divergent-2/page-30.html","bookId":1699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM"}
