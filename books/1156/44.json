{"id":43238,"no":44,"title":"CHAPTER XLIV.","content":"Royal Ainsley leaned forward, and caught Mrs. Lester\u0027s arm, saying hastily:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I repeat, that you shall have one hundred dollars if you will but give the child into my custody.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Again I ask, what could you, a bachelor, do with it, Mr. Ainsley?\" said Mrs. Lester.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had an answer ready for her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know a family who lost a little one, and would be only too delighted to take the infant and give it a good home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lester breathed a sigh of relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am very poor, as you know very well, Mr. Ainsley,\" she answered, \"and I can not refuse your kind offer. Take the little one with welcome. Only be sure that it is a good home you consign it to.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He counted out the money and handed it to her, and she resigned the infant to his arms. At that moment they heard the shriek of the incoming express.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is the train I was going to take,\" she said, \"and now I am out the price of my ticket, which I bought in advance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you will give it to me, I will use it,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She handed him the ticket, and in another moment Mrs. Lester saw him board the train with the child.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder if I have done right or wrong,\" she thought, a scared look coming into her face. \"It was all done so quickly that I had not the time to consider the matter. But this much I do know; I have the hundred dollars in my pocket, and that is a God-send to me. We need the money badly just now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She turned and walked slowly away; but somehow she did not seem quite easy regarding the fate of the little child.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I ought to have asked him the name of the family to whom he was going to take the baby,\" she mused; \"then[188] I could have written to them to be very careful, and to bring her up to be a good and true woman. I shall certainly ask him all about it the very next time I see him—that is, if I ever do see him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile the train thundered on, carrying Royal Ainsley and the child away. It was hard to keep back the expression of mingled hatred and rage with which Royal Ainsley regarded the infant he held in his arms. He knew full well that the child was his own, but he had no love for it. If it had died then and there, that fact would have afforded him much satisfaction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But one course presented itself. He would take it to New York, and once there, he would have no further trouble with it—he would manage to lose it. Many waifs were found on the doorsteps, and no one ever could trace their parentage, or whose hand had placed them there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In all probability he would never run across Ida May again. She believed her child dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While these thoughts were flitting through his brain, the little one commenced to cry. Its piteous wails attracted the attention of more than one person in the car.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mother,\" said a buxom young woman sitting opposite, \"I am sure that young man is a widower, left with the little child, and he is taking it to his folks. You see he is in deep mourning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll bet that baby\u0027s hungry, mother, and I\u0027ll bet, too, that he hasn\u0027t a nursing-bottle to feed it from.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can depend upon it that he has one,\" remarked her mother. \"Every father knows that much about babies.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course he has it in his pocket; he never came away without one; but he is so deeply engrossed in his own thoughts that he does not hear the baby. Don\u0027t you think you ought to give him a little reminder of it?\" said her daughter, thoughtfully. \"You\u0027re an elderly woman, and can do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He might tell me to mind my own business,\" said the elder woman. \"Some strangers don\u0027t take kindly to other people meddling in their affairs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [189]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the plaintive wails of the infant increased instead of diminished, the elder woman got up and made her way up the aisle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley started violently as he felt the heavy hand on his shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why don\u0027t you feed your baby, sir?\" she said, brusquely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked at her angrily, his brows bent together in a decided frown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you mean by interrupting my thoughts, woman?\" he cried, harshly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His angry retort roused all the antagonism in the woman\u0027s nature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I mean just what I say—your baby\u0027s hungry, mister,\" she replied. \"If you had the feelings of a loving father, you\u0027d know enough to feed it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked at her in consternation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Feed it?\" he echoed, blankly. \"I—I was not prepared for anything like this. Such a thing did not occur to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you didn\u0027t bring a nursing-bottle along with you?\" echoed the woman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" he responded, curtly, but also somewhat blankly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good Lord! that\u0027s just like a man, to forget important things like that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What am I to do?\" he asked, appealingly. \"What would you suggest, madame. I am at sea.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked at him perplexedly; then her motherly face brightened as she glanced about the car.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will soon see what can be done,\" she answered, making her way as quickly as the moving train would allow to the end of the car, where two women sat with tiny infants on their laps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Very soon she returned with the article she had gone in search of.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me take the poor little thing,\" she said, \"and feed it. Men, and more especially young men, don\u0027t know anything about such things.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley gladly delivered his charge into her keeping. Very soon the woman had stilled its cries, and[190] it was sleeping peacefully in her arms. An idea then came to Royal Ainsley. His pale-blue eyes glittered with a fiendish light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He almost laughed aloud at the thought that flashed through his mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think the baby will sleep a little while?\" he asked, drawing his hat down over his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is likely to,\" she answered; \"still, one can not always tell. Samantha, my daughter here, never slept ten minutes on a stretch when she was a baby. She was a lot of trouble to me then; but I don\u0027t mind it now, for she\u0027s a heap of comfort to me, sir. I wouldn\u0027t know how to get along without Samantha. She——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley interrupted her impatiently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was going to say that if you would be kind enough to hold the little one for awhile I would like to go into the smoking-car and smoke a cigar.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49816.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
