You and your clone are both incredible people. Based on what I know, your clone is acknowledged as the strongest person in the realm by multiple teams. And you are not far off for edging over team Celestial. Your potentials are extraordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng paused for a moment before he spoke. \"It seems like you are familiar with me. I don\u0027t know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionheart bowed. \"You wouldn\u0027t know a side character like me. I am nothing more than a nobody who struggles to survive in this realm. Someone who wishes to slowly grow and avoid anyone powerful. If it isn\u0027t for the final hour coming near, I wouldn\u0027t have taken the leader position. Hehe. The good old days when you won\u0027t be put into a team battle without a leader. Now, team battles are forced upon you whether the team has a leader or not. I dislike this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng had entered the third stage the moment Lionheart appeared and emulated HongLu\u0027s thinking process. The chance of obtaining useful information from this man was slim but people on the level of HongLu could make great use of even the vaguest information. Xuan on the other hand was on a non-human level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean… the last time, or in an earlier team battle, the other team gave you information of me and my clone? Someone that knows us well… Neos? No. A smart person like Neos wouldn\u0027t be oblivious of the meaning of the final battle. He wouldn\u0027t leak our team\u0027s information given our relationship, unless you had the upper hand and forced him to trade it with the team\u0027s survival. Yet, I don\u0027t see that you have the strength to put him in those circumstances. He\u0027s someone only slightly below Xuan. That means you encountered team Celestial, am I right?\" Zheng said as though he was speaking with himself. His eyes fixed on Lionheart with a sharp gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionheart was surprised. He laughed and said. \"Your guesses are accurate. Indeed, we met one of the two strongest teams after battling an unknown team. We were the mice under the claws of the cat in that movie. We almost died for their amusement. We were lucky a civil war broke out in their team. They eventually came to terms but we managed to escape death with the opportunity. Team Celestial\u0027s leader knew it became impossible to wipe our team and decided to negotiate in the end. We paid an expensive price for a fraction of the information they possessed about this realm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng continued talking to himself. \"Team Celestial. Adam is more intelligent than Neos. He wouldn\u0027t do anything pointless. Why did he give you the information about me and my clone? I can only guess you are related to us… Yet, I don\u0027t know you. So, it must be my clone who knows you. And the two of you are bonded by animosity… I get it. Your clone joined team Devil. He joined before my clone. Is it? My clone is searching for you in the realm because he wants to kill you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elegance faded from Lionheart\u0027s face. A wicked expression took its place but the elegance quickly returned. He laughed in a low volume and said. \"That\u0027s beside the point for today. I am not here to discuss who I am. Since you are team China\u0027s leader, let\u0027s talk about what we will be up against.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beside the point?\" Zheng chuckled coldly. He lowered his head and twirled the hair on his forehead. \"Okay. Let\u0027s treat it as beside the point. What are you planning to do? Taking the risk to meet me before a team battle begins. You can\u0027t be here to establish a connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Risk?\" Lionheart rubbed his nose and gave off a cheerful laughter. \"I don\u0027t feel there\u0027s any danger meeting you. Did you switch the positions we are in? The one in danger should be you, especially when you are standing under the dish and your teammates aren\u0027t with you. Team China doesn\u0027t even have a psyche force user. Haha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you retarded?\" Zheng calmly looked at him. \"Bring your whole team if you want to fight me and please use the weapons on the fortress. Or else… do you want to die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionheart was dumbfounded for a few seconds before he laughed out. \"I am not bothering to debate with you. Not like I am here with mal-intent anyway. What do you think of an alliance with us, us and several other teams? For the final battle and to fight against team Devil which is growing with madness every day. Team Celestial is communicating with every team. Once a team\u0027s strength is verified, they will be able to join the Angel Alliance. You still don\u0027t know what your clone did right? He\u0027s gone insane…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough Lionheart\u0027s narration, Zheng learned that his clone invented a method to control any person who hadn\u0027t reached the fourth stage at the mental level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The control he instills is permanent. One couldn\u0027t reverse the change that happened even after reaching the fourth stage. What a terrifying man he is. He\u0027s not seeking for the victory anymore. He desires to control all the teams in order to control this realm. Body control is nothing when he controls the soul!\" Lionheart said in an agitated tone while looking at Zheng. However, Zheng didn\u0027t show any unnecessary emotion. It felt as though he deemed what his clone was doing as normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionheart paused for a moment before continuing. \"What do you mean by this? Are you going to let his insanity continue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng gave a cold laughter. \"Insanity? Why does insanity exists? Damn your insanity. You speak as though you are justice. Do you think I don\u0027t know what kind of people you are? How many in team Celestial are actually acting with good will? As for you… if I am not wrong, you enslave your team like cattle to feed you points and rewards. You kill them to keep your team rating low while your strength become disproportionately strong. You are probably among the people who are selected into team Devil. And my clone killed your clone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionheart laughed and clapped his hands. \"Impressive. This ability to think of so much in such a short amount of time puts me to shame. You\u0027re correct. I was cloned into team Devil and your clone killed him. Your clones issued an order to all the teams under his control, an order for arrest that included all the people he will kill. Any team that killed these people will be rewarded or even freed once he confirmed it. Don\u0027t feel happy yet. I am not the only one on there. You and your whole team are on the order. Your clone has decided to kill you. Haha. Are you sure you can ignore it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng shook his head. \"I can\u0027t. But that does not have anything to do with you! I won\u0027t trust this Angel Alliance. Instead of taking a stab on the back, I\u0027d rather put my life on the bet to fight my clone! If I die, it will be a blissful death compared to being framed and backstabbed and die in grief! Clean your neck and prepare yourselves in this movie. Team China will surpass team Celestial and team Devil. We are the strongest team in this realm!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionheart chuckled. He leaned his body slightly in a bow and said. \"Since you have decided to ignore our wish for peace, we have the responsibility as a member of the Angel Alliance to eradicate the potential threat that is team China. You can\u0027t come to the sky and we can\u0027t come down before the fire begins. This conversation is the limit we can achieve at this time. Farewell then. I believe you can show me the prowess of your clone the next time we meet. Or at least a fraction of his strength. Haha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hologram figure faded in his laughter. The dish that was floating a hundred meters above the ground rose and flew into the sky fortress. Zheng finally relaxed the grip on Tiger\u0027s Soul. He had the urge to attack the dish when it was close to the ground and would have attacked if Lionheart didn\u0027t mention they couldn\u0027t come to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Why didn\u0027t we get this message? Is the leader the only person capable of receiving it? Or is it a limitation only placed on team Pacific to limit their influence advantage? Damn it. Seeing a trash and can\u0027t attack… Just wait. Wait for Xuan to come.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Zheng pondered, he didn\u0027t notice the civilians and cops were shocked. Politicians ran out from the White House and all looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-5-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-6-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-6-1","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
