He was clad all in black, his long hair falling around his face. I blinked, startled, as I realized he was wearing the long coat of a priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Glynis, I am so glad you are here. You must meet Father Ignatius. He has traveled all of Europe and has even been to our quaint little town,” Andrew said with a wide grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius rose smoothly to his feet and reached out his hand in greeting. “I have heard much about you, Countess Dracula. You are the talk of the ball.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Father Ignatius, a pleasure,” I said, probably sounding far too startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius took my hand, bowing over it. “The pleasure is mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Father was telling us about his research into folklore and it is fascinating. He was telling us of something called a vampire. Did you not read a story by Lord Byron about such a creature?” Andrew asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes. But it was actually Polidori who wrote it,” I answered. I felt disconcerted and completely at a loss as to how to act. I was sure I was acting quite ridiculous. I was glad for my veil or else they would have seen my utter astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes, John Polidori. That half-Italian chap who hangs out with that scoundrel Bryon,” Emil said. His nose was so red, I was quite sure he need not drink more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius was just as handsome as I remembered with his long raven hair and intense dark blue eyes. He smiled kindly, but his eyes were slightly wicked as he gazed at me. I instantly desired him as much as I ever had, despite his façade as a priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it possible that no one else felt the fire that burned between us? Evidently not, because the conversation continued around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a gruesome tale,” I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it? I never read it,” Andrew said and took another sip of his wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know the rubbish they publish these days is geared toward the more foolish, uneducated minds,” Dr. Baum declared, waving his cigar about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I disagree. I rather think it is aimed toward those aspects of human nature that we tend not to embrace,” Ignatius responded. “We are not privy to each other’s deepest thoughts. Our fears, our desires, our passions.” He gazed solemnly at me as he said these things, his expression quite thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes, the human mind is quite complex. We are always far too ready to divulge in idle gossip or retell the most lurid stories,” Dr. Baum agreed. “But, as a priest, surely you believe we should shy away from such things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a priest, I think we should not lie about our true natures,” Ignatius answered with a wry smile. “Do you not agree, Countess Dracula?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at him from behind my veil, but managed to keep my tone light. “Oh, we should not lie about our true natures, but I really do not think we should expose all our deepest secrets to those around us. There is something to be said about discretion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should we not acknowledge our true natures, then try our very best to make better men of ourselves?” Andrew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better men and women,” Ignatius said. “Do not discount the power of a woman. They carry much more weight in the lives of men than we give them credit for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed at this. “Well, I cannot disagree with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am sure you are an intricate part of your husband’s life,” Ignatius said to me. “Do you not feel by embracing who you are, you are a more powerful helpmate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember that I had thought him rather far too clever. He was trying to draw out information about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I try to be what he needs me to be,” I answered with a wave of my fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sister is a devout and good wife to Count Dracula. The man is absolutely terrifying, yet she is loyal and loving,” Andrew said with great emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quite drunk, I could see now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that she has endured all that she has and continues to be the light she always was in my life speaks volumes,” Andrew continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I heard of the terrible tragedy of your family,” Ignatius said softly. “I am glad that your husband was able to recover you from the wreckage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at him behind my lace veil and almost stomped my foot at him. He seemed to love saying the word “husband” over and over again. Most likely to peeve me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot remember too much of that time,” I said briskly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, of course not,” he answered. “It was a great tragedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greater than you know,” I said, my fan fluttering quite quickly before me. I was nervous, yet I wanted to be alone with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sister is a good and brave woman,” Andrew said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, here,” Dr. Emil said, toasting me. “A good fine Englishwoman. May you soon return home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But are you not home? Is not Buda your home now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius definitely was trying to procure too much information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buda is my home,” I said quickly. “But England is my heart’s home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, there is Sir Stephen,” Dr. Baum said standing and swaying slightly. “Stephen, Stephen, over here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked sharply toward the man whose name made my still heart clench. He moved toward us slowly, winding his way through the crowd of guests. I could see he was nervous and I wondered where Vlad was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stephen, you must meet Father Ignatius,” Dr. Baum said as Stephen joined us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Father Ignatius?” Stephen asked in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then my brother, Dr. Baum, and I, all realized that Ignatius was no longer among us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, he must have slipped away,” Dr. Baum said with some consternation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew finished his drink and signaled for another. “We are far too drunk to be very observant, Emil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True, true,” Dr. Baum said with a great laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, gentlemen,” I said, then slipped away into the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel Ignatius\u0027 power still in the room. Moving in its wake, I tried to seek him out. My gaze swept back and forth, but he was nowhere to be seen. I was drawn to a door on the far end of the ballroom hidden behind the huge marble pillars that lined the room like sentinels. Hesitating, I laid my hand on the doorknob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was utterly dark. When I shut the door behind me, only the moonlight slipping through the curtains gave any illumination. I blinked a few times, then I could see a bit better. I was in need of blood and my vision was poor. Slowly, I realized he was seated in the corner of the room in a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving toward him, I suddenly stopped. He was deliberately keeping his face shrouded, but I could plainly see his pale white hands on the arms of the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You…you…”I stammered. “You were in Bistriţa ! You followed me here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly, I was only trying to converse with a lovely young woman after a long journey,” he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense! You followed me to Buda. Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Father Ignatius,” he answered, standing up slowly, letting the shadows fall from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Liar,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we not both liars?” he said with a smile, then caught my wrist, drawing me near. “Why the veil, Countess Dracula?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why the cassock?” I tried to pull away, but he was stronger. He was warm from feeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you scarred? Did the hunters hurt you? Or your husband harm you?” He reached for the veil as I pulled back. “Tell me, dearest Glynis…or shall I say Countess…why is your face covered? Are you truly mourning your family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my absolute desire to kiss him, I was angry with him, so I fought him and tried to draw away once more. He pulled me about and pulled back the veil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your face is whole,” he whispered, and I realized he was quite relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to make a flippant remark, but he kissed me, passionately, desperately, and all words were lost as I responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, his lips left mine and he said softly, “I feared the worst when you did not come to me that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could not. My brother is in town and Vlad…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your husband-“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My Master. He merely calls me his wife. Vlad would have suspected me that night if I had canceled my brother’s visit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could have sent notice,” Ignatius said reproachfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I could not. I do not trust my servants. They are in league with my Master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you do not love him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I despise him. I play this charade to keep my brother alive. There is much you do not understand and I have not the time to tell you. But it is true my family is dead save Andrew. And I will do what I must to keep him safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So your family did die at Bârgãu Pass?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I shook my head, my eyes filling with tears. “No, he killed them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius pulled me tight against him, his fingers stroking the nape of my neck. “I am terribly sorry, Glynis. For a moment, I was not sure what to believe of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot tell you of all that I have endured. Even now I fear that Vlad may find us and realize the depths of my betrayal.” My voice was but a mere whisper. Tears caught in my lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius leaned down to kiss me softly. “I am saddened by your predicament and wish to save you from it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him as I said in a tremulous voice, “But how? He is powerful and cruel. He holds me to him by his blood in my veins. I am but a pawn in his game and so is my brother. The web in which I am entangled threatens all I love. Even you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked thoughtful, his expression quite distant. His hand stilled against my neck. At last, he said, “I am at a loss. All I know is that in this moment I wish nothing more than to take you with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me you are stronger than Vlad and that you could crush him and I will go with you.” I knew his answer before he spoke, but I had wished to hear other words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is more complicated than that. Your Master has woven a greater web than you realize.” He sighed softly. “I am restricted by that which I cannot explain to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do not trust me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are Vlad’s child. You know what he can do to make you do as he desires. He must not even know I am here.” Ignatius sighed wearily, then sat down on the arm of a chair. His hands rested on my waist as he gazed up at me. “You would be truly the most complicated creature I have ever met, in personality and circumstances. And I, of course, would have to fall madly for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not help but smile at this. “I am rather much, am I not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly,” Ignatius laughed. He grew somber and pulled me close to him. Resting his head against my bosom, he whispered, “I would take you with me in this moment if I could. We shall find a way to free you of Vlad. I swear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding my hands up to cup his face, I kissed him. “I wish to be with you. Free of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaying his hands over mine, he whispered back, “And you will be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed a chaste kiss despite our passion for each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am saddened by your status, yet enthralled to be with you,” Ignatius said, standing to take me fully into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dreamed of seeing you again and it gave me hope,” I confessed. “I wanted desperately to come to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand now. Do not worry yourself about that,” Ignatius smiled wryly. “I must confess, I came here tonight seeking you. I saw you in passing, in the carriage with Vlad, coming here. I could not see your face, but I felt your presence. And I had to know if you were all I believed you to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hurt by his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my face to console me. “I know who Vlad is. I know what he is capable of. I had a moment of sheer panic, I admit to that.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-57.html","bookId":2614,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM"}
