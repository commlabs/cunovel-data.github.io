Danilo put a fur muff over my bound hands and wrapped my coat around my shoulders. With an iron grip, he steered me off the train and toward a waiting carriage. \"Do not make a sound. I don\u0027t want to mar that pretty face of yours again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl in the black habit followed us silently. She would obviously not help me if I tried to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head was still throbbing. I wondered if my face was bruised from where I\u0027d been hit. Would people notice? \"Where are you taking me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo squeezed my arm tighter, and I worried that he would actually break it. Mentally I listed the bones in the arm: ulna, radius, humerus. The hand: carpals, metacarpals. I stumbled a little as he guided me into the carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea how much time had passed since the last time I\u0027d been conscious. One day? Two? I knew we were in Trieste from the signs at the train terminal, but what was in this godforsaken city? I smelled signs of the sea as we rode in the carriage through the streets. We approached a crowded harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we boarding a boat?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo smiled, but the green eyes gazing back at me were Konstantin\u0027s. \"You are at the start of a long journey, Katerina,\" he said. \"Already you are quite a ways from home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered Militza\u0027s tarot card. Had she known what was happening to her brother? And what he had planned? \"Your sisters must be worried about you, Danilo,\" I ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes changed back to the crown prince\u0027s piercing black. He looked confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you fight Konstantin?\" I whispered. \"Do you know where we are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to Egypt. He\u0027s looking for the sword.\" Danilo looked dazed, and scared. Of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What sword?\" I asked, but before he could answer, the lich tsar was back in control. \"Think about your sisters, Dani,\" I begged. That seemed to help him hold on and concentrate. \"Militza and Anastasia are worried about you, I\u0027m certain. They will come looking for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Danilo was gone again. The lich tsar sneered at me. \"They have no power over me, Duchess. Your powers are the only ones I am concerned with.\" His hand reached out and I flinched, but this time he was chillingly tender. He only caressed my jawline. \"Soon I will show you what delightful wickedness a necromancer is born to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage had pulled into the chaotic harbor. I was alarmed. Egypt was thousands of miles away from St. Petersburg. Why would Konstantin take me there? Was the sword he searched for the same one George had spoken of? Surely it couldn\u0027t be a coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harbor was teeming with people shouting in all sorts of languages. I heard threads of conversations in German, Italian, French, and even some Greek. The sea air was hot and damp, uncomfortable for a day in late autumn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo strange-looking men met us at the docks. They gave the crown prince three boarding passes for the steamer in front of us. With the boarding passes in one hand, Danilo gripped my arm again with his other and guided me toward the steamer. The girl in the black habit followed behind, directing a man carrying luggage whom I had not noticed earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor less than a second I thought about crying out for help; Danilo had already heard my thoughts. \"If you want your family to remain safe, you will stay quiet and do exactly as you\u0027re told,\" he warned. \"These men have comrades stationed in St. Petersburg awaiting my orders. I\u0027d hate for some sort of accident to befall the Duchess of Oldenburg. Or your proud papa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick but remained silent. Who were these men who would follow such madness? They looked odd, not quite right. Not undead, as I had first thought, but not human either. They had no cold lights at all. What could it mean? I tried not to stumble as he pushed me up the gangplank. Danilo showed our boarding passes to the ship\u0027s purser, who welcomed us aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me to show you to your cabin,\" a young man in a smart sailor\u0027s uniform said. He led us to a suite on one of the upper levels. It appeared we would be sailing in comfort, and perhaps for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must we go to Egypt?\" I demanded as Danilo pushed me into my room. \"That girl is not an appropriate chaperone. I don\u0027t even know her name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me. \"You\u0027ll find your new trousseau has already been taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed a trunk in the corner of the cabin. \"I will not marry you, Danilo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, and once again the crown prince\u0027s sad eyes stared back at me. \"It would make your life so much easier if you stopped fighting me, my love. I will untie you as soon as the steamer puts off.\" He turned to go but stopped to look back at me with another grim smile. \"It would not be wise of you to try and swim back to Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank down onto my bed, my wrists raw from the tight ropes, and stared in horror at the trunk on the floor. This had to be a nightmare. I prayed to wake up, safe in St. Petersburg. George, I thought miserably, please find me. Hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cabin was cramped but elegant, and must have cost Danilo a small fortune. The bed was made with soft French linens, and there was wooden paneling on the walls. I looked out the tiny window to see the brilliant blue waters of the Mediterranean. I refused to think about what awaited me at the end of this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell asleep on the bed waiting for Danilo to come and untie my hands. It was dark by the time he returned. The strange men were with him. \"Who are you?\" I asked, looking at one directly as I rubbed my newly freed wrists. He remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are servants of the sword, Duchess,\" Danilo said. \"They are loyal to me, and when I possess the sword known as the Morning Star, their brothers will all be compelled to follow me. We will return to St. Petersburg in triumph and defeat Alexander Alexandrovich once and for all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crown prince was losing control over his body. I worried that his personality was starting to melt with the lich tsar\u0027s. Would Danilo be lost forever? There had to be a way to defeat Konstantin Pavlovich without destroying Danilo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Morning Star must have been the weapon of which George had spoken. A weapon to be wielded only by a necromancer. \"What sort of creatures are these men?\" I asked the crown prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are the Grigori. Their kind has been in hiding for thousands of years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d heard of them before. George and the French wizard Papus had mentioned the Grigori when we\u0027d been in the Crimea last year. But they had not told me who the Grigori were. \"Are they blood drinkers?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not!\" Danilo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they are not alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do not die. But it is not the same as being undead.\" Danilo was in that strange limbo, where he was not quite himself but not quite Konstantin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must a necromancer carry their sword, then?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must a necromancer perform the ritual to summon the bogatyr?\" he countered. \"Both require your ability to manipulate cold light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the Grigori do not have a cold light.\" None that I had seen, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lich tsar\u0027s eyes gleamed in Danilo\u0027s face. \"The Morning Star provides them with cold light.\" He stood up and looked out the tiny window at the setting sun. \"You should dress for dinner. I will return to take you to the ship\u0027s dining room at eight o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was left alone, I sighed and opened the trunk to examine the dresses Danilo had provided. There were expensive gowns from Paris, smart English riding suits, and flimsy nightgowns that made me blush. I decided I would sleep in my own clothes, in the gray-blue gown I had intended to wear at my wedding. My heart twisted as I slipped out of the dress and laid it on the bed. I had to believe that George Alexandrovich was searching for me. That I would be rescued soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI selected a pale rose gown for dinner. Its neckline was the highest of all the gowns in the wardrobe, even though it was much lower than any of my gowns at home. I carefully put away the others, praying this trip would be over soon and I would not have to wear anything else that Danilo had bought me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-16.html","bookId":2655,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM"}
