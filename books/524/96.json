{"id":21347,"no":96,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Soon afterwards a letter came from Albert, asking for money, but again Reuben forbade any notice to be taken of it. For one thing he could not afford to help anyone, for another he would not even in years of plenty have helped a renegade like Albert. His blood still boiled when he remembered the boy\u0027s share in his political humiliation. He had shamed his father and his father\u0027s farm. Let him rot!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Albert\u0027s letter remained unanswered—Caro felt that Reuben was unjust. She had grown very critical of him lately, and a smarting dislike coloured her [Pg 337]judgments. After all, it was he who had driven everybody to whatever it was that had disgraced him. He was to blame for Robert\u0027s theft, for Albert\u0027s treachery, for Richard\u0027s base dependence on the Bardons, for George\u0027s death, for Benjamin\u0027s disappearance, for Tilly\u0027s marriage, for Rose\u0027s elopement—it was a heavy load, but Caro put the whole of it on Reuben\u0027s shoulders, and added, moreover, the tragedy of her own warped life. He was a tyrant, who sucked his children\u0027s blood, and cursed them when they succeeded in breaking free.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Caro had been much unhappier since Rose\u0027s flight. She had loved her in an erratic envious way, and Rose\u0027s gaiety and flutters of generosity had done much to brighten her humdrum life. Now she was left to her brooding. She felt lonely and friendless. Once or twice she went over to Grandturzel, but the visits were always difficult to manage, and somehow the sight of her sister\u0027s happiness made her sore without enlivening her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was only lately that her longing for love and freedom had become a torment. Up till a year or two ago her desires had been merely wistful. Now a restless hunger gnawed at her heart, setting her continually searching after change and brightness. She had come to hate her household duties and the care of the little boys. She wanted to dance—dance—dance—to dance at fairs and balls, to wear pretty clothes, and be admired and courted. Why should she not have these things? She was not so ugly as many girls who had them. It was cruel that she should never have been allowed to know a man, never allowed to enjoy herself or have her fling. Even the sons of the neighbouring farmers had been kept away from her—by her father, greedy for her work. Tilly, by a lucky chance, had found a man, but lucky chances never came to Caro. She saw herself living out her life as a household drudge, dying an old maid, all coarsened by uncongenial work, all starved of love, all sick of, yet still hungry for, life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e Sometimes she would be overwhelmed by self-pity, and would weep bitterly over whatever task she was doing at the time, so that her tears were quite a usual sauce to pies and puddings if only Reuben had known it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The year passed, and the new year came, showing the farm still on the upward struggle, with everyone hard at work, and no one, except Reuben, enjoying it particularly. Luck again favoured Odiam—the lambing of that spring was the best for years, and as the days grew longer the furrows bloomed with tender green sproutings, and hopes of another good harvest ran high.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Caro watched the year bud and flower—May came and creamed the hedges with blossom and rusted the grass with the first heats. Then June whitened the fields with big moon-daisies and frothed the banks with chervil and fennel. The evenings were tender, languorous, steeped in the scent of hay. They hurt Caro with their sweetness, so that she scarcely dared lift her eyes to the purpling twilight sky, or breathe the wind that swept up heavy with hay and roses from the fields. July did nothing to heal her—its yellow, heat-throbbing dawns smote her with despair—its noons were a long-drawn ache, and when in the evening hay and dust and drooping chervil troubled the air with shreds and ghosts of scent, something almost akin to madness would twist her heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She felt as one whose memory calls and yet has nothing to remember, whose thoughts run to and fro and yet has nothing to think of, whose hopes pile themselves, and yet is hopeless, whose love cries out from the depths, and yet is loveless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One evening at the beginning of August she wandered out of the kitchen for a breath of fresh air in the garden before going up to bed. Her head ached, and her cheeks burned from the fire. She did not know it, but the flush and fever made her nearly beautiful. She was[Pg 339] not a bad-looking woman, though a trifle too dark and heavy-featured, and now the glow on her cheeks and the restless brilliancy of her eyes had kindled her almost into loveliness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She picked one or two roses that drooped untended against the fence, she held them to her breast, and the tears came into her eyes. It was nearly dark, and the lustreless cobalt sky held only one star—Aldebaran, red above Boarzell\u0027s firs. A puff of wind came from the west, and with it a snatch of song. Someone was singing on the Moor, and the far-away voice wove itself into the web of trouble and yearning that dimmed her heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She moved down to the gate and leaned over it, while her eyes roved the twilight unseeing. The voice on the Moor swelled clearer. It was a man\u0027s voice, low-pitched and musical:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Farewell, farewell, you jolly young girls!\n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027re off to Rio Bay!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She remembered that there had been a wedding at Gablehook. One of the farmer\u0027s girls had married a Rye fisherman, and this was probably a guest on his way home, a little the worse for drink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"At Vera Cruz the days are fine—\n\u003cbr\u003e Farewell to Jane and Caroline!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The song with its hearty callousness broke strangely into the dusk and Caro\u0027s palpitating dreams. Something about it enticed and troubled her; the singer was coming nearer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"At Nombre de Dios the skies are blue—\n\u003cbr\u003e Farewell to Moll, farewell to Sue!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stood at the gate and could see him as a blot on the Moor. He was coming towards Odiam, and she[Pg 340] watched him as he plunged through the heather, singing at the pitch of his lungs:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"At Santiago love is kind,\n\u003cbr\u003e And we\u0027ll forget those left behind—\n\u003cbr\u003e So kiss us long, and kiss us well,\n\u003cbr\u003e Polly and Meg and Kate and Nell—\n\u003cbr\u003e Farewell, farewell, you jolly young girls!\n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027re off to Rio Bay.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had struck the path that ran by the bottom of the garden, and swaggered along it with the seaman\u0027s peculiar rolling gait, accentuated by strong liquor. Caro felt him coming nearer, and told herself uneasily that she had better go back into the house. He was drunk, and he might speak to her. Still she did not move, she found herself clinging to the gate, leaning her breast against it, while her tongue felt thick and dry in her mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was quite close—she could hear the thud of his step on the soft earth. Her hands grasped the two gate-posts, and she leaned forward over the gate, so that her face caught the faint radiance that still lingered in the zenith. He had stopped singing, but she could see him now distinctly—a tall, loosely-built figure, with dark face, and woolly hair like a nigger\u0027s, while his seaman\u0027s earrings caught the starlight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He drew level with her, not seeing her. She did not move, she scarcely breathed, and he had almost passed her ... then suddenly his eyes turned and met hers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hello, Susan!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood swaying before her on his heels, his hands in his trouser-pockets, his head a little on one side. Caro did not speak—she could not.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What time is it, dear?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I—I dunno,\" she faltered, her voice sounding squeaky and unlike her own: \"it might be nine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It might be Wales or Madagasky,\n\u003cbr\u003e It might be Rio de Janeiro.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e he trolled, and Caro was suddenly afraid lest someone should hear in the house. She glanced back uneasily over her shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Papa on the look-out?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She coloured, and began to stutter something.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve been to a wedding,\" he said conversationally; \"a proper wedding with girls and kisses.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He suddenly leaned over the gate and kissed Caro on the lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She gave a little scream and started back from him. For a moment earth, sky, and trees seemed to reel together in one crazy dance. She was conscious of nothing but the kiss, her first kiss; it had smelt and tasted strongly of brandy, if the truth were told, but it had none the less been a kiss, and her sacrament of initiation. She stood there in the darkness with parted lips and shining eyes. The dusk was kind to her, and she pleased the sailor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come out for a walk,\" he said, and lifted the latch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Caro trembled so that she could hardly move, and once again came the feeling that she ought to turn and run back into the house. But she was powerless in the clutch of her long-thwarted emotions. The tipsy sailor became God to her, and she followed him out on to the Moor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After all he was not really drunk, only a little fuddled. He walked straight, and his roll was natural to him, while though he was exceedingly cheerful, and often burst into song, his words were not jumbled, and he generally seemed to have a fair idea of what he was saying.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She wondered if she were awake—everything seemed so strange, so new, and yet paradoxically so natural. Was she the same Caro who had washed the babies and cooked the supper and resigned herself to dying an old maid? She could not ponder things, ask herself how it was that a man who had not known her ten[Pg 342] minutes could love her—all she realised was his arm round her waist, and in her heart a seethe of happy madness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"When the stars are up above the Main\n\u003cbr\u003e And winking in the sea,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Tis then I dream of thee,\n\u003cbr\u003e Emilee!\n\u003cbr\u003e And my dreams are full of pain.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e —sang the sailor sentimentally. His arm crept up from her waist to her shoulder and lay heavy there. They strolled on along the narrow path, and the darkness stole down on them from the Moor, wrapping them softly together. They told each other their names—his was Joe Dansay, and he was a sailorman of Rye, who had been on many voyages to South America and the Coral Seas. He looked about twenty-five, though he was tanned and weather-beaten all over. His eyes were dark and foreign-looking, so was his hair. His mouth was a trifle too wide, his nose short and stubborn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was now leaning heavily on Caro as he walked, and too shy, and perhaps reluctant, to ask him to lift his arm, she naively suggested that they should sit down and rest. Dansay was delighted—she was not the timid little bird he had thought, and directly they had sunk into the heather he seized her in his arms, and began kissing her violently on neck and lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Caro was frightened, horrified—she broke free, and scrambled to her feet. She nearly wept, and it was clear even to his muddled brain that her invitation had been merely the result of innocence more profound than that which had stimulated her shyness. Rough seaman though he was, he was touched, and managed to soothe her, for she was too bashful and frightened to be really indignant. They walked a few yards further along the path, then at her request turned back towards Odiam.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They parted uneasily, without any arrangement to meet again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59468.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
