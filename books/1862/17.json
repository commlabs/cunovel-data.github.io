Ash was wearing a brand-new shirt bought at the Briar Creek general store, a turtleneckwith\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong sleeves that covered the almost-healedscars on his throat and arms. His jeans werebleached white,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis hair was combed over the scabon the back of his head, and he was playing the scene of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knew about a rogue werewolf and didn\u0027t tell.anybody about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she was a traitor. And what did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh shrugged. \"Staked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really,\" Ash said earnestly, looking intoQuinn\u0027s face with what he knew were wide, guileless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes-probably blue. \"See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout taking his eyes from Quinn\u0027s he whipped a pink-and-green country quilt off the bundle on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s eyebrows flew upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared for a moment at Aunt Opal, who had been cleaned so that you\u0027d never know she\u0027d ever been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburied, and who had the picket stake carefully replaced in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn actually swallowed. It was the first time Ash had ever seen him falter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really did it,\" he said. There was reluctant respect in his voice-and definite shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, Quinn, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re quite as tough as you pretend. After all, no matter how you try to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eact like an Elder, you\u0027re only eighteen. And you\u0027ll always be eighteen, and next year maybe I\u0027ll be older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Quinn said, blinking rapidly. \"Well. Well___ I have to hand it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I just decided the best thing to do was cleanup the whole situation. She was getting on,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s dark eyes widened fractionally. \"I have toadmit -I didn\u0027t think you were that ruthless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve gotta do what you\u0027ve gotta do. For the family honor, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn cleared his throat. \"So-what about thewerewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I took care of that, too.\" Ash meandered over and whipped a brown-and-white quilt off\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhibit B. The wolf was a charred and contorted corpse. It had given Mary-Lynnette hysterics when Ash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einsisted on pulling it out of the car, and Quinn\u0027s nostrils quivered when he looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, it does smell like burnt hair, doesn\u0027t it? Igot a little sooty myself, keeping him in the fire....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You burned himalive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is one of the traditional methods....\"\"Just put the blanket back, all right?\" Ash put the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblanket back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you see, everything\u0027s taken care of. No humans involved, no extermination necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, all right ...\" Quinn\u0027s eyes were still on the quilt. Ash decided the moment was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And by the way, it turns out the girls had aperfectly legitimate reason for coming. They just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewanted to learn to hunt. Nothing illegal about that,is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh. No.\" Quinn glanced at Aunt Opal, then finally looked back at Ash. \"So they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoming back now that they\u0027ve learned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, eventually. They haven\u0027t quite learned it yet... so they\u0027re staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027restaying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.................\"Right.

You see what\u0027s happened\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout one. You get families of outlaw werewolves wandering around. Somebody\u0027s got to stay here and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehold down the fort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ash ... you couldn\u0027t payNight People to strand themselves out here. Nothing but animals to feed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon, nobody but humans to associate with ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s a dirty job, but someone\u0027s got to do it.Besides, wasn\u0027t it you who said it\u0027s not good\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eliving your whole life isolated on an island?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn stared at him, then said, \"Well, I don\u0027t thinkthis is much better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it serves my sisters right. Maybe in a few years they\u0027ll appreciate the island more. Then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheycan hand the job over to someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ash ... no one else is going to comehere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well.\" With the battle won, and Quinn simplylooking dazed and as if he wanted to get back to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosAngeles as fast as possible, Ash allowed himself a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmall measure of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might come visit them someday,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did a beautiful job,\" Rowan said that evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We heard it all from the kitchen. You would have loved it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn can\u0027t wait to get away,\" Jade said, in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etertwining her fingers with Mark\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel said to Ash, \"I\u0027d just like to be around when you explain all this to Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s funny,\" Ash said. \"I feel just the opposite.\" Everyone laughed-except Mary-Lynnette. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebig farm kitchen was warm and bright, but the windowswere darkening. She couldn\u0027t see anything in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egathering darkness-in the last two days the effects of her blood exchange had faded. Her senses were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eordinary human senses again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure you won\u0027t get in trouble?\" sheasked Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll tell our dad the truth-mostly. That anoutlaw werewolf killed Aunt Opal and that I killed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe werewolf. And that the girls are better off here,hunting quietly and watching out for other rogues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s sure to be some record of the Lovett fam ily.... Dad can check out the history all he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A whole family of outlaw werewolves,\" Kestrel said musingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ofcrazy werewolves,\" Ash said. \"They were as dangerous to the Night World as any vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunters could be.

I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette captured her gaze and held it. \"Rowan, you arenotgoing to feel guilty for this. You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t have realized. He wasn\u0027t killing for food like a normal werewolf. He was killing to protect his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eterritory-and to scare us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it might have worked,\" Mark said. \"Exceptthat you guys didn\u0027t have anywhere else to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh looked at Mark, then at his sisters. \"I have a question. Is the territory around here going to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough foryou?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Rowan said, with gentle surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t always need tokill the animals,\" Jade said. \"We\u0027re getting it down pat now.

Heck, we can even trythe goat. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather try Tiggy,\" Kestrel said, and for a moment her golden eyes glimmered. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esay it, but she wondered sometimes about Kestrel. If maybe, someday, Kestrel might need a bigger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eterritory of her own. She was a lot like Jeremy in some ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful, ruthless, single-minded. A true Night Person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about you?\" Ash said, looking at mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? Uh... Well, when you get down to it, I\u0027m kind of a hamburger guy....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to take him hunting last night,\" Jade interpreted. \"You know, just to show him.

Mary-Lynnette noticed they didn\u0027t stop holding hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I take it you\u0027re not going to become a vampire,\" Ash said to Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, let\u0027s just say not any time soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh turned to Mary-Lynnette. \"And what about the human end of things?

But all they know is that he\u0027s disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Rowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette held up another finger. \"Two,Dad is sorry but not surprised that the stationwagon blew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup.

Nobody\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomes out here so nobody will notice she\u0027s gone. And I think we can bury her and Jeremy safely.

And giveme time to finish growing up. I\u0027m still in high school, Ash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be out in a year. I\u0027ll come back then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may be too soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027ll come back anyway.\" He smiled ironically. \"And in the meantime I\u0027ll fight dragons,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust like any knight for his lady. I\u0027ll prove myself. You\u0027ll be proud of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s throat hurt. Ash\u0027s smile disappeared. They just stood looking at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the obvious time for a kiss. Instead, they just stood staring like hurt kids, and then one ofthem\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoved and they were holding on to each other. Mary-Lynnette held on tighter and tighter, her face\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburied in Ash\u0027s shoulder. Ash, who seemed to have lost it altogether, was raining kisses on the back of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher neck, saying, \"I wish I were a human. I wishI were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t,\" Mary-Lynnette said, seriously unsteady because of the kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wouldn\u0027t help, and Mary-Lynnette knew he knew it. The problem wasn\u0027t simply what he was, it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas what he\u0027d done-and what he was going to do. He\u0027d seen too much of the dark side of life to be a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enormal person. His nature was already formed, and she wasn\u0027t sure he could fight it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe in me,\" he said, as if he could hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t say yes or no. So she did the only thing she could do-she lifted her head. Hislips\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere in the right place to meet hers. The electric sparks weren\u0027t painful anymore, she discovered? and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epink haze could be quite wonderful. For a time everything was warm and sweet and strangelypeaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, behind them, somebody knocked on thedoor. Mary-Lynnette and Ash jumped and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseparated.They looked at each other, startled, emotions still tooraw, and then Mary-Lynnette realized\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere she was. She laughed and so did Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come out,\" they said simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark and Jade came out. Rowan and Kestrel werebehind them. They all stood on the porch-avoiding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe hole. They all smiled at Ash and Mary-Lynnette in a way that made Mary-Lynnette blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye,\" she said firmly to Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her for a long moment, then looked at the road behind him. Then he turned to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette watched him, blinking away tears.She still couldn\u0027t let herself believe in him. But there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas no harm in hoping, was there? In wishing. Evenif wishes almost never came true....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gasped. \"Look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all saw it, and Mary-Lynnette felt her heartjump violently. A bolt of light was streaking acrossthe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarkness in the northeast. Not a little wimpyshooting star-a brilliant green meteor that crossedhalf the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esky, showering sparks. It was right above Ash\u0027s path, as if lighting his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA late Perseid. The last of the summer meteors. But it seemed like a blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick, quick, wish,\" Mark was telling Jade eagerly. \"A wish on that star you gotta get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette glanced at his excited face, at theway his eyes shone with excitement. Beside him, Jade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas clapping, her own eyes wide with delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m so glad you\u0027re happy, Mary-Lynnette thought. My wish for you came true. So now maybe I can wish for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish ... I wish ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh turned around and smiled at her. \"See you next year,\" he said. \"With slain dragons!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started down the weed-strewn path to the road. For a moment, in the deep violet twilight, he didlook\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto Mary-Lynnette like a knight walking off ona quest. A knight-errant with shining blond hair and no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweapons, going off into a very dark and dangerous wilderness. Then he turned around and walked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebackward, waving, which ruined the effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone shouted goodbyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette could feel them around her, her brother and her three blood-sisters, all radiating warmth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand support. Playful Jade. Fierce Kestrel. Wise and gentle Rowan. And Mark, who wasn\u0027t sullen and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esolitary anymore. Tiggy wound himselfaround her ankles, purring amiably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even when we\u0027re apart, we\u0027ll be looking at the same sky!\" Ash yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a line,\" Mary-Lynnette called back. But hewas right. The sky would be there for both of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem.She\u0027d alwaysknow hewas out there somewhere,looking up at it in wonder. Just knowing that was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimportant. And she was clear on who she was at last. Shewas Mary-Lynnette, and someday she\u0027d discover a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esupernova or a comet or a black hole, but she\u0027d doit as a human. And Ash would come back next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she would always love the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[The End] \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-17.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:55 PM"}
