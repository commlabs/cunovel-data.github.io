A flicker of energy brought a dozen candles to life, revealing the largest, most garish bedroom Daisy had ever seen. She glanced around, somewhat awed by what she saw. The walls were papered in a dark red print. The carpets were the same shade, as were the heavy velvet drapes drawn over the single window. An enormous bed covered with a black spread took up a good portion of the room. A black stone fireplace took up one entire wall; a TV screen took up another wall from floor to ceiling. There were more paintings in this room, all originals, Daisy assumed, and all beautiful. Figurines of varying sizes--all depicting demons, dragons, or vampires stalking their prey--occupied an antique curio cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like being in hell\u0027s waiting room,\" Daisy murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik laughed as he placed her in the center of the bed. \"You make it heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flatterer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I told you that I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Daisy O\u0027Donnell, Blood Thief extraordinaire, with everything that I am, my whole being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words warmed her heart, her soul. \"I love you, too, but you know that, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it enough, Erik? Can love be enough for two people who are as different as we are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his knuckles up and down her cheek, then cupped her face in his hands. \"I don\u0027t know, Daisy darlin\u0027. I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to have to think about it now, didn\u0027t want to worry about the past or the future. She wanted only to live for this moment, with his body covering hers, his hands lightly caressing her while he rained kisses over her face, her neck, her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft moan rose in her throat when she felt his fangs lightly scrape the skin along the side of her neck. Threading her fingers through his hair, she drew him closer, her body arching up to meet his as his tongue laved the tender skin beneath her ear. His body melded with hers, stroking lightly, as his fangs pierced her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her hands over his shoulders, her nails digging into his flesh as sensation after sensation washed over her. She had heard of two becoming one, but she had never experienced anything like this. It was beyond pleasure, beyond ecstasy. Belatedly, she realized she was also feeling what Erik was feeling, what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobbed his name as wave after sensual wave exploded deep within her. A moment later, he shuddered and then, with a sigh, buried his face in her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her for several minutes while their breathing returned to normal and the perspiration cooled on their flesh. When he would have rolled away, she wrapped her arms around him and held him close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too heavy for you,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" It was a welcome weight. She smiled inwardly, thinking about what she had learned while they made love. He adored her. He thought she was beautiful, that her skin was baby soft, that her hair was like russet-colored silk, that her blood was sweeter than the finest wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard all that, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" she replied. \"And more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik grunted softly. \"I\u0027ll have to be careful about what I\u0027m thinking in the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you feel what I was feeling, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. It goes both ways, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased up onto his elbows and gazed down at her. \"I never thought of myself as a hottie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t thinking that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted one brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, two minutes, three at the most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter washed over her. \"Ah, Daisy, my little flower, do you know how much I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran her hands over his shoulders, down his chest to where their bodies were still joined. \"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning down, he kissed the tip of her nose. \"More than words can say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" She raked her nails over his chest. \"Then I guess you\u0027ll just have to show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like this?\" Rolling onto his side, he dropped butterfly kisses on her brow, her cheeks, the curve of her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered with delight as he continued his slow assault on her senses, his tongue like a flame as he licked her breasts and belly, then kissed his way down the sensitive skin along the inside of her thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when she was writhing in delicious torment did he cover her body with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy was hovering on the brink of sleep when her cell phone rang. Rolling onto her side, she reached over the edge of the bed, searching for her handbag. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex!\" She sat up, suddenly wide awake. \"What time is it? Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what time it is. Four thirty, five. Just get home. And bring the vampire with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vampire?\" Erik\u0027s deep voice rumbled from the other side of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy\u0027s heart skipped a beat at the sound of his voice. \"Alex wants us to come home,\" she told him, and then wondered why she bothered. No doubt Erik had heard every word Alex had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy, you still there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Alex. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got an answer to that e-mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! We\u0027ll be there as soon as we can.\" Daisy looked at Erik and whispered, \"It\u0027ll be light out soon. Will that be a problem for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you don\u0027t mind my spending the day at your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind,\" she said with a mischievous grin. \"You can sleep in my bed, like Sleeping Beauty. And I\u0027ll wake you later with a kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, I said we\u0027ll be there as soon as we can.\" After disconnecting the call, she looked at the time. \"Five fifteen.\" The sun would be rising in another hour or so. \"What\u0027s he doing up at this time of the morning, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably waiting for you to come home,\" Erik replied with a wry grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the phone onto the floor, Daisy slid under the covers again. \"I hate to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\" Erik stroked her back, loving the warmth of her skin beneath his hand, the little purr of pleasure that rose in her throat at his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy sighed. \"I guess we should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a quickie first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Alex said to hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, we\u0027ll hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not too fast,\" Daisy said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Erik agreed, drawing her body against his. \"Not too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex was waiting for them at the front door. \"What the hell took you so long to get here?\" he asked irritably, and then grimaced as he took in his sister\u0027s tousled hair and swollen lips. \"Never mind. I don\u0027t wanna know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head in disgust, he turned on his heel and stalked into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Rhys?\" Erik asked, his gaze sweeping the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, you don\u0027t know? Dammit, he didn\u0027t go out, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I think he\u0027s sacked out in Daisy\u0027s closet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My closet!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"What\u0027s he doing in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shrugged. \"He wanted a room without a window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, he doesn\u0027t know about the e-mail you received?\" Erik asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no! I wasn\u0027t about to wake him up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a wise decision,\" Erik said, chuckling. \"Let\u0027s go have a look at that e-mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering under his breath, Alex headed for Daisy\u0027s office and sat down at the desk. It took only moments for him to boot up and find the anticipated message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stood behind him, reading over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me tonight at the back door\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof La Morte Rouge at midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBring the proof with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\" Daisy said. \"No way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t be alone,\" Erik said. \"I\u0027ll be there with Rhys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be there,\" Daisy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik and Alex both said, \"No,\" at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Daisy asked. \"I\u0027ve got just as big a stake in this--you should pardon the pun--as you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex scowled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik laughed. \"You\u0027re staying home because I said so, and because I have a pretty good idea who\u0027s behind this, and I don\u0027t want you anywhere around when we meet. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy glared at him, her hands fisted on her hips. \"And if I refuse, what are you going to do, tie me to a chair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or to the bed,\" Erik retorted with a wicked grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you could keep it down in here? Some of us were trying to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik glanced over his shoulder as Costain entered the room. \"I\u0027ve never known you to turn in before sunrise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys snorted softly. \"There\u0027s nothing else to do here.\" He jerked his chin toward the computer. \"So, what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got an answer to Alex\u0027s e-mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys moved up behind Alex, his gaze moving quickly over the words on the screen. He grunted softly. \"They want a meet, at midnight, at my place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. \"So it seems. Does that strike you as odd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a mortal, yes,\" Costain replied, his voice deceptively mild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not for one of us,\" Erik mused. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-44.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
