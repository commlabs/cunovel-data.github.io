A mix of business and pleasure. Many of the artists signed to Vidal Records will be there. I was thinking it\u0027d be great networking for your roommate - he\u0027s got the right look for music video.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brightened. \"That would be wonderful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristopher grinned and passed the invite over. \"And you\u0027ll both have fun. No one throws a party like my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced briefly at the envelope in my hand. Why hadn\u0027t Gideon said anything about the event?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re wondering why Gideon didn\u0027t tell you about it,\" he said, seemingly reading my mind, \"it\u0027s because he won\u0027t come. He never does. Even though he\u0027s the majority shareholder in the company, I think he finds the music industry and musicians too unpredictable for his tastes. By now, you know how he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark and intense. Powerfully magnetic and hotly sexual. Yes, I knew how he was. And he preferred to know what he was getting into at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured at the deli when we reached it, and we stepped inside and got in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place smells awesome,\" Christopher said, his gaze on his phone as he typed out a quick text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The aroma delivers on its promise, trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled a delightful boyish smile that I was sure knocked most women on their asses. \"My parents are really looking forward to meeting you, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seeing the photos of you and Gideon over the last week has been a real surprise. A good surprise,\" he qualified quickly when I winced. \"It\u0027s the first time we\u0027ve seen him really into someone he\u0027s dating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, thinking he wasn\u0027t so into me right now. Had I made a terrible mistake by leaving him alone last night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the counter, I ordered a grilled vegetable and cheese panini with two pomegranate smoothies, asking them to hold the one with a protein shot for thirty minutes so I could eat in. Christopher ordered the same, and we managed to find a table in the crowded deli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked about work, laughing over both a recent baby food commercial faux-blooper that had gone viral and some backstage anecdotes about acts Christopher had worked with. The time passed swiftly, and when we parted ways at the entrance of the Crossfire, I said good-bye with genuine affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed up to the twentieth floor, and found Mark still at his desk. He offered me a quick smile despite his air of concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t really need me,\" I said, \"I think it\u0027d be good for me to sit this presentation out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he tried to hide it, I saw the lightning quick flash of relief. It didn\u0027t offend me. Stress was stress, and my volatile relationship with Gideon was something Mark didn\u0027t need to think about while he was working on an important account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re golden, Eva. You know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and set the drink carrier down in front of him. \"Drink your smoothie. It\u0027s really good, and the protein will keep you from feeling too hungry for a little bit longer. I\u0027ll be at my desk if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I put my purse in the drawer, I texted Cary to ask if he had plans on Sunday or if he\u0027d like to go to a Vidal Records party. Then I got back to work. I\u0027d started organizing Mark\u0027s files on the server, tagging them and placing them in directories to make it easier for us to assemble portfolios on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mark left for the meeting with Gideon, my heartbeat quickened and a clutch of anticipation tightened my stomach. I couldn\u0027t believe my excitement just from knowing what Gideon was doing at that particular moment, and that he\u0027d have to think of me when he saw Mark. I hoped I\u0027d hear from him after that. My mood picked up at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next hour, I was restless waiting to hear how things had gone. When Mark reappeared with a big grin and a spring in his step, I stood up in my cubicle and applauded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a gallant, exaggerated bow. \"Thank you, Miss Tramell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so stoked for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross asked me to give you this.\" He handed me a sealed manila envelope. \"Come to my office and I\u0027ll give you all the deets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe envelope had weight and rattled. I knew from touch what I\u0027d find inside before I opened it, but still the sight of my keys sliding out and into my palm hit me hard. Gasping with a pain more intense than any I could remember, I read the accompanying note card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, Eva. For everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours, G\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Dear Jane brush-off. It had to be. Otherwise, he would\u0027ve given me the keys after work on the way to the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a dull roaring in my ears. I felt dizzy. Disoriented. I was frightened and agonized. Furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was also at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes and clenching my fists, I pulled myself together and fought off the driving urge to go upstairs and call Gideon a coward. He probably saw me as a threat, someone who\u0027d come in, unwanted and uninvited, and shook up his orderly world. Someone who\u0027d demanded more from him than just his hot body and hefty bank account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my emotions behind a glass wall where I was aware of them waiting in the background, but I was able to get through the rest of my workday. By the time I clocked out and headed downstairs, I still hadn\u0027t heard from Gideon. I was such an emotional disaster at that point I felt only a single, sharp twinge of despair as I exited the Crossfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it to the gym. I shut my brain off and ran full-bore on the treadmill, fleeing the anguish that would hit me soon enough. I ran until sweat coursed in rivulets down my face and body, and rubber legs forced me to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling battered and exhausted, I hit the showers. Then I called my mother and asked her to send Clancy to the gym to pick me up for our appointment with Dr. Petersen. As I put my work clothes back on, I mustered the energy to get through that last task before I could go home and collapse on my bed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-60.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
