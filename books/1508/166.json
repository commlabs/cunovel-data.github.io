It was an unshakeable embodiment of his will.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first time that Lin Ming had seen Qin Ziya, he had felt a faint aura of righteousness from him, as if there was some vast wave that lay in the depths of his heart. This was Qin Ziya’s Zither Heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the second time that he had seen Qin Ziya, it was different. Although his appearance, voice, temperament, and even scent were the same, he was actually missing that Zither Heart!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I see, so it was like that. There was someone masquerading as Qin Ziya! What kind of camouflage technique could be realistic to this point? And they actually dared to pose as Qin Ziya! This person must have known that Qin Ziya had already left the Seven Profound Martial House; otherwise he would never have even an ounce of courage to pretend to be him. Qin Ziya moves around from place to place so much that not even the Allied Trade Association has the ability to find out where he is. It can only be someone high up within the Seven Profound Martial House, like Ouyang Dihua! That fake Qin Ziya might have even been Ouyang Dihua himself. He could have learned some profound and mysterious transfiguration technique from the Seven Profound Valleys to fool me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It seems that the Seven Profound Decree is also fake, and the whole mess with Huoluo Nation and the Seraphic Pond and the quota of people were also fabricated by him.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming took the ‘Seven Profound Decree’ from his spatial ring and ruefully smiled. He had only just glanced at the Seven Profound Decree one time, so he hadn’t been able to figure out if this one was real or fake.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was figuring out everything that happened, he felt a sudden shaking in his chest; his heart began to rapidly beat, and heat flowed through his blood to all his limbs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?

It was like a happy puppy that kept jumping up and down without being able to calm down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This little fellow, what’s he doing?” Lin Ming though that was peculiar. Originally the Thunder Soul was the more lively and active one, and the Flame Essence was usually sitting calmly around, so why was it so jumpy today? Thinking back on this, when he had used Thunderfire Annihilation a moment ago, the Flame Essence had been exceptionally excited, and the fires that it had produced were much more formidable than in the past!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCould it be… Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s memories flashed before his eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course! He was so silly! Since the Flame Essence was able to absorb lava fire, then it could absorb other types of fires. He hadn’t thought that the Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation technique that Huo Gong had released a moment ago was a type of energy that he could have absorbed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now that Huo Gong had died, how could he absorb it…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Flame Essence shouldn’t be so excited without a good reason.

Obviously, this was the so called Red Lotus.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No, this isn’t a Flame Essence.

The only reason that the Flame Essence within Lin Ming’s body had formed was because he had the mystical secret skill, Heretical God Force, which was powerful to the extent of going against heaven’s will. It was easier said than done to find a Flame Essence that had naturally formed in nature.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were many refiners and alchemists who had searched their entire lives for a Flame Essence and had only ended up empty-handed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Gon’s cultivation had also just barely brushed against the Houtian realm. With his cultivation, the only way that he could obtain a Flame Essence was by having a fortuitous event.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, since he was a refiner, Huo Gong must have had a way to control fire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Gong had managed to obtain a wisp of Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation Flame. Although the Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation Flame was a high-grade flame, in the end a mere flame was still a flame; it was impossible for it to be eternal like a true Flame Essence. It would slowly wither and fade away with time. However, a true Flame Essence would never be extinguished.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf one didn’t want it to fade away, then one could only constantly refine it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Gong had paid a great price to collect various fire attribute materials in order to refine and stabilize the wisp of Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation Flame. During this period, he even had to steal a material from his sect, and thus broke sect rules and was expelled, then was forced to flee the Seven Profound Valleys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter endlessly refining all sorts of precious materials into a high-grade flame, it would eventually become a Hollow Flame Essence, otherwise known as an artificial Flame Essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Hollow Flame Essence could exist for hundreds of years. During this time, in order to maintain its great power, one had to constantly refine materials into it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Hollow Flame Essence was far inferior to a true Flame Essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA true Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation Flame Essence could casually release Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation Flames. Just by taking one of these wisps of flames and adding many fire attribute materials, one could create a Hollow Flame Essence!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the flames that a Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation Hollow Flame Essence released were not Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation flames. Rather, they were just flames that were slightly superior to ordinary flames. Otherwise with Lin Ming’s cultivation, how could he possibly resist it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Although this is a Hollow Flame Essence, there are countless flame attribute exotic materials and treasures refined within it; it is an absolutely nourishing flame attribute material.

The Hollow Flame Essence fiercely struggled, but no matter how it fought, its efforts were ultimately futile.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis process lasted for half an incense stick of time. The Hollow Flame Essence began to gradually shrink, becoming smaller and smaller, until it was eventually all sucked into that little Flame Essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe little Flame Essence had grown up just a bit.

These true essence stones were enough for him to use for a very long while. “I should sell the treasures that this fellow made for money and exchange them for true essence stones and other things.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough a refiner would have a lot of money, they also spent money quickly because they had to purchase various materials to refine. This fellow had also bought up various flame-attribute materials in order to refine his Hollow Flame Essence. These were not small expenses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBesides these treasures and true essence stones, there was nothing more of value. There was a jade slip with a cultivation method inside and there were also some fire attribute materials that were apparently to be used to raise the Hollow Flame Essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming absorbed these materials into the Heretical God Seed and turned them all into the Flame Essence’s nutrients.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the jade slip, he glanced at it once and wasn’t too interested. It was a medium-grade human-step cultivation method. Of course, if he were to sell it he could obtain a great deal of money.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lin Ming had inventoried everything, the most precious things that he had found were the high-grade human-step treasure saber and the spatial ring itself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming put away the spatial ring, and poured some true essence into his Flame Essence to cremate Huo Gong. However, at this moment a flash of flame blazed out from Lin Ming’s hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was shocked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-164\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-166\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-165","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:17 AM"}
