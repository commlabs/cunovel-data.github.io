Curtis walked with his head high and chest out, but not even his coal black skin could hide his swelled eye socket or injured lips. Due to the darkness of his skin, the injuries weren’t all that noticeable, only, the tactical vest had already been been turned into tattered cloth strips, and the sturdy trousers already became triangle briefs. In addition, his movements were extremely stiff, actions that required slightly more motion making him grimace in pain. It was clear that his injuries weren’t light.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFrom when the restroom door was closed to when it was reopened, less than a minute had passed.

He immediately reached his hand out towards the wall, no longer having time to worry about appearances, but this still wasn’t enough. In the end, his entire body leaned against the wall, and only then did he stabilize himself.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLafite’s figure emerged from behind the restroom door. His head of silver hair was no longer fluttering about in this place without wind, but instead falling down in a disordered and messy manner. The delicate white jadelike skin on his face and upper body was covered in purple color, with fist marks and finger traces everywhere. There were some areas that were swelled high up, his situation seemingly not much better off than the captain’s. This was especially the case when one saw that the left side of his face had an especially clear shoe imprint, and from its size, it was clear that it was the exact same as the captain’s shoe. From top to bottom, Lafite’s only unchanged part was the silver colored blindfold.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLafite’s gait was more steady and calm than the captain’s, but as soon as he left the restroom, his body couldn’t help but shake. He immediately held onto the restroom door, and only then did he prevent himself from falling. His eyes that were covered looked in the captain’s direction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What are you looking at?
