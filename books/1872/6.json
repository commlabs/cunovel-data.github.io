Evy had probably already seen him through the glass. His heart was beating so fast he could barely breathe. He took a deep breath, wondering what his problem was, and pushed. Soft music drifted over him from above as he stepped inside, the smell of coffee and apple cinnamon permeating the air. The tables were mostly empty, which wasn\u0027t surprising at nine o\u0027clock on a Monday morning. Brooke grabbed a blueberry muffin from the glass case and started for the register. She saw Dean and froze. Evy bumped into her from behind, knocking an iced mocha from her hands. They jumped back, dodging the spill as it exploded across the tiled floor. Evy slowly looked up from the mess to her sister, who stood gawking at Dean as he quietly approached the counter. Evy followed Brooke\u0027s stoic gaze and her eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen those green eyes fell upon him, everything else faded down a long tunnel that stretched for miles. His blood pounded thickly in his temples, driving the music from his ears and replacing it with a pulsating thud. He crossed the black and white checkered floor on rubbery legs. It was all he could do to keep from tripping over his own two feet. He tried to focus but Evy\u0027s hair spilled over her shoulders like chocolate waterfalls and the need to run his fingers through it consumed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she said, a tentative smile pulling at her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally reached the counter and rested against it, struggling for breath after the long walk through quicksand. \"Looks like I\u0027m not the only one who\u0027s all thumbs around here,\" he said, observing the chocolate colored mess on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled in embarrassment. \"Her fault,\" she said, jerking a thumb at Brooke. \"She stopped short.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black lady in a pretty dress that masked her weight let out an irritable sigh, her long purple nails drumming against the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy apologized and turned her mesmerizing gaze back to Dean. \"Give me one second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time,\" he replied, watching her make a new drink and falling in love with the back pockets on her tight fitting jeans. It seemed like months since he had last seen her and he craved more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes snapped over to Brooke and slowly lowered to his black sports coat and jeans. \"Thanks, got a big meeting today so I figured I\u0027d grab a box of muffins on my way in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you did,\" she said coyly, setting the blueberry muffin on the counter in front of the black lady. \"No tie, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smoothed his button down and shook his head. \"Trying to quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your style,\" she grinned, letting her gaze wander to his crotch for a moment. \"You married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows pulled together. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brooke,\" Evy softly warned, drizzling chocolate syrup over whip cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just trying to figure out what\u0027s wrong with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady by the register sized Dean up from head to toe, her nails clicking against the counter. \"He\u0027s obviously gay. No way a man that good looking is straight. Trust me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke burst into laughter while Dean flushed with heat. \"I\u0027m not gay either. Not that\u0027s there\u0027s anything wrong with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm-hmmm,\" the woman moaned through her nose, taking the new drink from Evy and handing her a ten. \"If that\u0027s true, I\u0027d handcuff his ass to your wrist before he gets away,\" she whispered to Evy, loud enough for everyone to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke laughed again and then grew somber, staring at Dean through wondering eyes. \"Take off your shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brooke!\" Evy shrieked, handing the lady\u0027s change back. \"What is wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady took the change and checked her watch. \"I\u0027ve got time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean tugged on his collar. \"Is it getting hot in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about to, sugar!\" the lady said, bellowing with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen pushed through the swinging door, holding Darth Vader\u0027s head on a platter. He stopped and followed everyone\u0027s gaze. \"You must be Steve,\" he said, carefully setting the head in the glass case and extending his hand. \"I\u0027m Ben, Brooke\u0027s husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Ben,\" Dean replied, shaking his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Dean,\" Brooke corrected out the corner of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Dean, sorry, man,\" Ben said, glancing at his wife. \"You\u0027re right; he does kind of look like Bradley Cooper, but way taller.\" He leaned forward like he was about to tell Dean an important secret. \"Those Hollywood types are always little hobbits in real life. Trust me, I\u0027ve been to LA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean pointed to the Darth Vader. \"Is that a cake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen followed the point and nodded. \"Billy Jefferson\u0027s ninth birthday tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is amazing. It looks just like his head!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen chuckled shyly. \"Thanks, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assorted?\" Evy asked, holding up an empty pastry box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean\u0027s eyes darted over to her. \"That\u0027d be great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Dean,\" Ben said, folding his beefy arms across an Avenged Sevenfold t-shirt. \"You from around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Born and raised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, do you know if that Jeffrey Dahmer tour is still going on anymore? I can\u0027t find out much about it online.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s my cue,\" the black lady said, grabbing her blueberry muffin and drink. \"Thank you, ladies,\" she sang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mrs. Johansen,\" Brooke and Evy said at the same time in airy voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke watched Mrs. Johansen disappear outside and turned to her husband. \"Ben, stop being so creepy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I\u0027m just trying to catch up on my Milwaukee history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go to a brewery,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen turned to Dean and rolled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean laughed. \"I\u0027m not exactly sure about the tour,\" he said, watching Evy fill his box and wanting to return the favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" Ben muttered. \"We did the Charles Manson tour last year in LA and it was insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean lifted his brow. \"I bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was like you could still feel their ghosts at those houses,\" Ben whispered, shivering with the chills. \"You believe in ghosts, Dean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean\u0027s eyebrows drew together. \"Ummm, well, one time my TV turned on in the middle of the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s eyes widened. \"I\u0027ve got an EVP recorder. You want me to come by sometime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"EVP?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen nodded. \"Electronic Voice Phenomenon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean swallowed dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy pushed past Ben and came around the counter. \"Let\u0027s go outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should grab a beer sometime, Deano,\" Ben hollered over the counter. \"I\u0027ll take some readings!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean shot a hand into the air, following Evy out front where four tables and chairs made up a small sidewalk cafe. She set the pastry box on a table and pulled out a white chair. He took off his jacket and sat down, watching the breeze tickle her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, that wasn\u0027t embarrassing or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems like a good guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He needs to stop asking people about that Jeffrey Dahmer stuff. Even I know it\u0027s a sensitive subject around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he doesn\u0027t seem like the type to be as interested in the Fonzie statue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled softly. \"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are Brooke and Ben from Des Moines as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What brought em here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben was a tattoo artist with this huge guy named Hicks at a parlor in Des Moines. Hicks is originally from Milwaukee and wanted to move back home to open his own shop with his cousin and Ben as partners. Ben was soooo excited about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder his cakes are so detailed. Guy\u0027s got skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Ben is incredible, and they found the perfect spot right here in downtown, but Hicks ended up getting into a bar fight the night before they were supposed to sign the lease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy nodded grimly. \"He\u0027s still got three years left to serve in prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, he must\u0027ve messed someone up pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smashed a pint glass into some guy\u0027s face over an argument about football.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor guy had to have a hundred and forty stitches and several rounds of reconstructive surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to the tattoo shop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Hicks went to prison it fell through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean cocked his head to one side. \"So Ben opened a dessert bar instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Sugars had been one of the places they had looked at for the tattoo shop but it had a kitchen they didn\u0027t need. Meanwhile, Brooke had always wanted to start her own bakery and Ben immediately thought of this place.\" Evy gazed at their reflection in Sugars\u0027 front window and smiled. \"He said he kept seeing her baking brownies in that kitchen. And when the dessert bar aspect came into play they found something they could enjoy doing together, like it was meant to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must really love her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand found his on the table. \"It was such a romantic thing for him to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed her hand and stared into her eyes. \"Would you settle for a dozen roses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkled her brow and laughed. He wanted to kiss the nape of her neck and work his way up to those luscious lips. They called to him without speaking and all he could think about was getting her alone and putting his hands all over her. She grinned as if reading his mind and dropped his scorching gaze. He waited for her eyes to find their way back to him, knowing it wouldn\u0027t be long. She wrung her fingers on the table in front of her and looked back up, making his heart stutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what\u0027re you doing tonight?\" he asked, finally breaking the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him. \"I\u0027m not sure. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take you out to dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twirled a lock of hair around a finger, his brown eyes and messy hair awakening something inside of her she never knew existed. Never before had she felt such heat make her body tremble. Her sister was right, there had to be something wrong with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just you and me this time, and nothing too fancy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded before she even realized she was doing it, unable to resist him in any way, shape, or form. It was way too late for that. \"What time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean checked his watch and softly knocked on Evy\u0027s front door. Silence answered him. His senses felt heightened, like a vampire. He could hear his heart banging against his chest. He shifted in his stance, trying to see through the heavy wooden door like he had x-ray vision. It was so quiet. Too quiet. He found himself wondering if she was even home, wondering if she had changed her mind. He stared at the peephole looking back at him. It looked like a light was on in the living room so he raised his fist to knock again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened with a loud crack as the swollen wood freed itself from the jam. He flinched with the noise and dropped his hand to his side, trying to act cool. Her warm smile and perfume washed over him. The front of her satin tank top was tucked into a pair of jeans that complimented her hips. His eyes traveled the length of her legs to the painted toes peeking out from some dark blue high heels. His heart responded accordingly, sending palpitations running amuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look...beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door all the way and stepped off to the side. \"Thank you. So do you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside, scanning every inch of the place like a crime scene investigator, wanting to know everything about her he possibly could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you passed the first test,\" she said, shutting the door and locking the deadbolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a vampire, because I didn\u0027t invite you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but you swept your hand out, which I think, technically, counts as sign language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red tongue wet her lips as she sashayed into the kitchen, her heels lightly clicking across the tiled floor. \"No biting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re no fun,\" he replied, examining some framed pictures for clues. \"This is a great place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she said, coming back into the room and handing him a cold bottle of beer. \"Have to park three blocks away but it has its charm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can see the lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed his gaze out an eastern facing living room window. \"Barely,\" she laughed, taking a quick sip of red wine and heading into the bathroom. \"Give me two minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No hurry,\" he said, running his hand along the hand carved woodwork adorning waist high built-ins dividing the quaint dining room from the kitchen. He bent for a closer inspection of her books and a picture of her and Brooke with what must be their parents. Their mom had the same dazzling green eyes, all of them stretching smiles from ear to ear as boats whizzed past in the background. \"Your parents must be really proud of you and your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head popped out of the bathroom. \"They are, but they wished we would have stayed closer to home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder and their eyes locked with some invisible bond, stronger than anything he had ever felt before. Her gaze ran down his long-sleeved button down to his jeans and boots. He thought he heard her sigh but wasn\u0027t sure. She blinked like she had just come to and ducked back into the bathroom. He gravitated toward her, dying to know what she was doing in there, needing just one more glimpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came around the corner of the small bathroom and leaned in the doorway, the smell of hair spray and lotion hanging in the air. He quietly watched her brush makeup onto her cheeks, each gentle stroke drawing him in closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped when she saw his reflection in the mirror and clapped a hand over her chest. \"Oh my God, you scared me,\" she chuckled. Her eyes fell to the sink and a gasp escaped her. She slid a compact-sized package of birth control pills into a drawer and slammed it shut, flushing with color the makeup could not hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said, taking a sip of beer while his eyes ravaged her entire body. \"But I think you\u0027re messing with perfection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at him in the mirror and set the brush down on the sink without looking, her eyes piercing him with something he could not read. She turned to him and shut the light off, her scent lighting him on fire. \"All done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her by the wrist and yanked her to him. This time he definitely heard a sigh. Her soft body pressed up against his, her perfume enflaming his senses. They gazed into each other\u0027s eyes, the air charged with beauty products and expectations of things to come, only breaking eye contact long enough to study each others\u0027 lips. Less than three inches of space stood between him and what he wanted and it was no match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting to do this all day,\" he whispered, pushing his mouth onto hers, tasting the sweet red wine on her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy took a startled step back and then threw her arms around his neck, sucking him into her mouth. Her eyes closed as her wet tongue flicked against his. He pushed her back into the bathroom and set his beer on the counter, cupping her face in his hands and gently directing her movements to mirror his own. Dean pressed his pelvis into her, forcing a light groan from her soul, which strengthened his resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy parted for breath and staggered backwards, staring at him in wild wonder, her chest heaving beneath her shiny top. She glanced at his silhouette in the mirror and shrank against the shower door. \"What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear on her face filled him with doubt, making his heart flutter. \"What is what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice shook when she talked. \"Whatever you\u0027re doing,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her with grave eyes, no intentions of going back now, and pulled her into his arms. Their faces jerked to a stop inches from one another. His fingers ran through her soft hair as her unmatched beauty sent tremors of anticipation shooting down his spine. He leaned in and kissed her softly, forcing himself to stop before he drained her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should probably go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard, her chest rising and falling. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her pass by, inhaling her fragrance that enveloped him like a mystical spell, and followed its trail into the living room. She took some lip-gloss from her purse and carefully ran it across her lips. His tongue swept across his own lips, his appetite getting wetter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, where are we going anyway?\" she asked, dropping the tube back into her purse and slinging the brown leather bag over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attempt at small talk made him grunt. \"My favorite pizza joint just around the corner. You hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes swept over to him as she blindly straightened her hair in front of an imaginary mirror. \"I could eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean nodded and followed her out into the brightly lit hallway where she stopped to lock the door. When she turned back around he pushed her up against the door and kissed her again. She didn\u0027t resist. Couldn\u0027t resist. He explored her soft curves, pouring buckets of blood into his stiffening manhood. He broke their kiss to gasp for air and forced her eyes to meet his. They spoke without talking, communicating in a language more reserved for the wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir lips gravitated back together. He tilted her head to the side and trailed down her jaw line, whispering her name in her ear before nibbling at the soft spot in her neck. The smell of her skin and hair intoxicated him with an unbridled desire that overwhelmed his control. She trembled against the door, unable to fight the hidden pull between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean pressed against her as she ran her hands down his muscular back. He paused to find her glassy eyes, their chests heaving against each other. \"If I don\u0027t stop myself now we\u0027re going to miss dinner\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not hungry...for food,\" she said faintly, her nipples poking through her top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words bolstered the stir in his pants. He took a deep breath before forcing his mouth onto hers and pinning her arms to the door. She squirmed beneath him, desperate to put her hands upon his body, but he wouldn\u0027t release her, letting his mouth have its way with her instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least somebody\u0027s havin a good night round here,\" a gray bearded man said with a grin as he squeezed past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched him disappear out the front door into the night, their mouths hanging open. Evy turned back to Dean, her hungry eyes sparkling like distant planets. She glanced down at the bulge in his pants and bit her bottom lip. In a flash, she spun on her heels and turned back to the door. He nibbled on her neck and cupped her breasts from behind, rubbing the slippery fabric against her erect nipples as she fumbled with the lock. He pressed his hardness against her rear end, loving the way he fit into her delicate curves. The door clicked open and they spilled back inside. He kicked the door shut with his foot and pushed her into the bedroom, kissing her the entire way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped in front of her bed, its white sheets and pillows as fluffy as a lazy cloud, kissing passionately as their hands explored each other like ravenous teenagers. Evy quivered beneath his touch as his hand slid up the small of her back, caressing every inch of her silky skin along the way. The voltage between them was palpable, enough to light an entire village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled his shirt over his head without wasting time with the buttons. Her fingers raked trails across his chest, reading his strapping curves like brail. His fingers traced along her sensitive sides, making her pull away and laugh. The metal clasp on her bra easily surrendered with a sinuous snap of Dean\u0027s fingers, a light moan bursting from her as he freed her lovely breasts. He slipped her top and bra over her head in one fluid motion and tossed them across the room where they could no longer impede his needful progress. Shadows caressed her curves, demanding discovery. He took her breasts by surprise and she moaned his name out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy gasped when he pushed her onto the bed, falling backwards with a soft bounce. Dean stood over her, breathing hard like he had just finished the Boston Marathon, a storm of emotions flooding his senses. He stared at her like a shocked school boy, savoring what was yet to come. \"You\u0027re the most beautiful thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the faint light spilling in from the living room, Evy\u0027s eyes roamed his rigid stature like wild horses, following the trails of the hardened muscles carving throughout his torso. She never dreamed anyone could look so gorgeous, like a Greek god found only in books and movies. She pulled him to her by the waist of his jeans and their lips reconnected like long lost friends. Dean inhaled her deep into his soul, pressing against her in the shadowy light, needing every drop he could take. She fumbled with his jeans, desperately twisting the top button in all directions until it finally relented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed loudly. \"I don\u0027t have a condom. I didn\u0027t think we would...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on the pill,\" she said in a sultry whisper. \"I\u0027ve only been with one person and was tested after it ended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been with anyone without a condom,\" he panted, staring into her eyes while caressing her cheek. \"Are you sure you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cut him off by healing their broken kiss and cupped his ass with both hands. His lips trailed off to nibble an earlobe and she groaned as he rubbed against her. \"Dean,\" she whispered, writhing beneath his touch. \"This is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words died as his teeth found a nipple and bit down with force. She threw her head back into the pillow and moaned louder, pulling at fistfuls of his hair. Dean sucked on her nipples, circling them with his tongue as he snatched her high heels and slid them off, producing one soft thud after another as they hit the floor. Her jeans were quick to follow, exposing a pair of red lace panties that nearly made his heart stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So beautiful,\" he whispered, letting the jeans slip from his fingers to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the fire leap higher in his eyes when her legs parted, and it made her even wetter. Dean ran his fingers along the inside of her leg, pushing her panties aside until finding her creamy center. She wanted him just as much as he wanted her. Evy arched her back as he rubbed circles into her clitoris, driving her wild. A finger slipped inside and she cried out, desperate for more. The room spun. She yanked on his hair and screamed for mercy as he sent another finger in to join the first. Her body shook like an earthquake. She was so wet and didn\u0027t know how much more she could take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dean,\" she gasped, pulling him back up by his hair. She found his untamed eyes, not believing it could be like this, needing to become one with him, like pieces of liquid metal melding together. \"I want you inside me,\" she said softly, ripping his jeans off like wrapping paper on a Christmas morning. She leaned back, her eyes widening in surprise as his stiff cock twitched in the air, reaching for her with a desperation she had yet to witness. Dean slid her panties past her feet and threw them over his shoulder without looking. Her pulse raced as they took each other in, the flames in his eyes making her purr with satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pinned her wrists to the mattress. She fought him for a few seconds before pulling her knees back and drawing him inside of her with her heels. Her eyes widened with the fleshy incursion, an audile groan spurting from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evy, you feel so good.\" he whispered into her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see his pulse thumping in his neck with each gentle thrust. Her entire body shuddered, her wrists pinned to the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean pumped harder and she trembled against him like a leaf. He pushed up, digging deeper, sending white explosions blasting against the back of his eyelids. Evy snapped her head to the side and gave him every velvety inch he desired, which he gladly accepted with greedy thrusts. She wrapped her legs around his back, locking him in as she tumbled head first into an earth shattering ecstasy she had deprived herself of for far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t stop,\" she moaned, tightening her muscles around his unforgiving cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plunged deeper, making her cry out to the ceiling. She tried to free her hands but he wouldn\u0027t release them. Her body tensed as his hips worked harder, faster. It was too much, had been too long. She arched her back and screamed his name, her body convulsing with jerky spasms. He clenched his teeth and exploded, emptying himself into her with pulsating bursts, his raw groans filling the room. Evy pulled him close, draining him into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared into each others\u0027 eyes with their chests swelling, his arms trembling like her legs, an electric current binding them together. He finally released her wrists and stared at her like it had been his first time. He smiled, gently tracing her lips with a finger before lowering his mouth to hers and softly kissing her again. She wrapped her throbbing arms around his back and pulled him deeper inside of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her hair with tender affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes peered deeply into his, searching for answers to something so unexplainable it bordered upon paranormal. \"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know, but whatever it was I want to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wry grin spread across her flushed cheeks as she worked her wet lips around his already stiffening pipe. His breath came faster. He pushed his lips into hers and pumped harder. She pulled away, struggling for breath as he regained his girth and slammed it home with an insatiable force. More blinding blasts shot through her field of vision. She ran her hands down his chest as he lifted himself up and lit the room on fire with a passion that refused to burn out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy poured dark coffee into a glass mug and glanced behind her to see if Dean was watching. He sat at her small dining room table, chewing with his mouth closed and that look in his eyes. Her insides twisted as sultry images of last night pushed to the forefront of her mind. It had never been like this with Richie. Not even close. She felt like she was looking down at Dean from above with her back resting comfortably against the warm ceiling. Nothing had taken her this high before and, like all drugs, she would need more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blew on the mug, sending wisps of steam spiraling into the air. \"So what do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed and cleared his pallet with a gulp of cold orange juice. \"You should be selling these at Sugars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and took a careful sip of the black brew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed a thick looking corn dog at her, holding it by its stick. \"Waffle dogs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and batted her lashes, hoping to arouse him into another flourishing round of love making that would leave them sweaty and famished. With the table hiding his black boxer-briefs, he looked completely naked. She tipped her mug back and took another cautious sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, dipping the jagged end of the waffle dog into a small bowl of warm maple syrup. \"This is definitely the greatest thing I\u0027ve ever had,\" he told her, taking another voracious bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just saying that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m serious. Waffle dogs are my new favorite thing.\" He stared at her for a few seconds, his eyes lowering to molest the breasts barely hiding beneath a thin camisole. \"Well, second favorite anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some people call them pigs in pancakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another bite and moaned his pleasure. \"The sausage is huge,\" he said with his mouth full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tongue swished across her lips, remembering the way his sausage had reached for her last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you get them? The store always has those little Hormel links or Jimmy Dean rolls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, trying to remember what they had been talking about but only seeing him buck ass naked with that fire in his eyes. \"Wholesaler through work,\" she finally spit out. \"Having the best links is the key to the whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe washed the bite down with more juice and winked. \"That\u0027s what I hear,\" he mumbled, chasing the juice with a sip of hot coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head back and laughed. \"Oh yeah, and who told you that? Your ex-girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waffle dog hovered in front of his open mouth, his teeth on the brink of biting down. \"No ex-girlfriend,\" he said, sinking his teeth into the sweet and salty goodness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thin eyes evaluated his statement over the rim of her mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The statute of limitations ran out on that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy arched a puzzled eyebrow at him and sat down at the small kitchen table, watching him devour his food like he had devoured her last night. \"Wow, you are really hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said, covering his mouth. \"But we skipped dinner and went straight to dessert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sinister grin slithered across her face as she ran her toes up his shinbone, her eyes silently pleading with him to take her on the table. Take her and prove that she was his and he was hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean swallowed and took a break to sip on his coffee. \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was the one person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA perplexed look slipped over her face like a Halloween mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night you said you\u0027d only been with one person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she mumbled, dropping his gaze. \"Did I say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it wasn\u0027t true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back up. \"No, it was true. We were engaged, until I found out he had cheated on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean\u0027s brow folded in disbelief. \"When was this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"No wonder you moved away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tight lipped smile cut across her face as she shifted in her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean could tell she was uncomfortable talking about it but his curiosity got the better of him. \"How long had you been...dating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran a finger around the rim of her mug, reluctant to relive any of the past. \"Almost twelve years.\" Her eyes jerked up to gauge his reaction. \"Since my sophomore year in high school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean\u0027s jaw dangled in the air. \"Seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richie was a junior when we met and, at the time, I thought he was the one but,\" she trailed off to inhale a deep breath, \"I couldn\u0027t have been more wrong about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean shook his head, not understanding how someone could ever cheat on a girl like her. She had it all\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the brains, the looks, the sense of humor, the cooking skills. It was baffling to say the least. \"How close were you to marrying this moron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes bulged from their sockets, realizing how close he had come to never even meeting her. \"Who does that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thank God for small miracles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy laughed lightly. \"Didn\u0027t seem like a miracle at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn awkward silence fell over them as Dean studied her through narrow eyes. \"I should send Richie a thank you card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and softened her eyes. \"You\u0027re sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished his orange juice in one chug and set the glass back down, his piercing gaze bobbing from her green eyes to the full breasts resting on the table. It took everything Evy had to keep from pretending to drop a fork just to sneak a peek under the table. She sent her foot in instead, running her toes up the inside of his leg to find him already getting hard. A playful smile danced across her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled back with that sparkle in his eyes she had been searching for. Mission accomplished. Her foot pressed against the erection trying to escape out the side of his boxer-briefs. He reached beneath the table and massaged her leg as her foot worked him over. He bent lower and ran his hand up her thigh, sending tingles shooting through her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bite off more than you can chew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, I saved room,\" he said, finding her soaking wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes and clutched one of her breasts, a light whimper slipping from her lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers slipped beneath her panties and traced her swollen lips before slipping inside. Her foot rubbed harder and he thought he might explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rap at the door made him bump the table and knock over his empty juice glass. He righted it as a frown took Evy\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the heck is stopping by so early?\" she mumbled, looking to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ignore it,\" Dean replied, getting up and coming around the table, a circus tent in his shorts. He spun her to the side of the chair and dropped between her legs, sliding her panties to her ankles in the blink of an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran her fingers through his hair as he bent her knees back and took her into his mouth, flicking his tongue against her clitoris. \"Oh my God,\" she moaned, spreading wider for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother knock at the door, this one much louder, rattled the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evy, it\u0027s an emergency!\" Brooke yelled through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy sighed, her shoulders dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean looked up with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her lips together and lowered her legs. \"I should probably see what she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed himself up with a deflated sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better hide,\" she said, squeezing his bulge and pulling her panties back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her butt wiggle as she scurried to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re in there, I saw the peephole get darker,\" Brooke said, looking into the peephole with one large eyeball. \"Come on, Evy! I\u0027m on my way into work and I need your keys. Ben took mine by accident and I can\u0027t get a hold of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy glanced back at Dean who was already shutting the bathroom door behind him. She took a moment to collect herself and opened the door a crack. Brooke barged in without waiting for an invitation, her brow creasing. \"Geez what took you so long? And why is your face so red?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy shut the door before anyone could walk by and see her in her underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke stopped and turned. \"Were you masturbating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just woke up,\" Evy replied, smoothing her hair and then grabbing her spare keys from an old desk drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are their two cups of coffee on the table?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy dangled the keys in front of her. \"Because I\u0027m thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke inhaled sharply and covered her gaping mouth with a hand. \"Oh my God, you had sex with Dean, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did!\" she exclaimed, investigating the apartment for signs of fornication. \"Evelyn Burnett! It\u0027s written all over your face!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy stifled a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dirty little whore! I thought I told you to always go to his place. What time did he leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" Evy said, planting the keys in her sister\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke\u0027s face grew somber. \"Just tell me one thing. Does he have a big cock? I deserve to know, Evy. I\u0027m your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy laughed sharply, her jaw dragging on the floor. \"What is wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke stepped into Evy\u0027s personal space, sharpening her gaze to a razor\u0027s edge. \"Is it bigger than a French baguette?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what, Brooke?\" Evy said, going around her into the kitchen. \"You need some Orbitz to clean up that mouth of yours up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke followed. \"Did he go down on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not having this conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many times did he make you cum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy snatched up her mug of Joe and wrinkled her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke stared blankly at her. \"It was multiple times, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy rolled her eyes and took a drink while Brooke grabbed a waffle dog from a plate on the stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it bigger than this?\" She raised the waffle dog along with her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have to open the store?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can wait.\" Brooke bit down and started chewing. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...did you blow him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you please stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke tilted her head. \"Oh honey, please don\u0027t tell me you let him cum in your face. That is so degrading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy stared at her in disgust, silence stretching across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light noise from the bathroom made Brooke\u0027s jaw come to a screeching halt. She swallowed hard and slowly turned to the bathroom. \"Oh my God,\" she whispered dully. \"He\u0027s still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to stop talking like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke cringed and quietly set the waffle dog back on the plate. \"You should\u0027ve told me,\" she hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you started talking,\" Evy said, taking Brooke\u0027s arm and ushering her to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke glanced over her shoulder, hoping for a sneak peek. Evy opened the door and Brooke stopped and turned in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do me a favor,\" she whispered, craning her neck to see around Evy. \"Send me a picture of it.
