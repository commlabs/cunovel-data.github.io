The Sky Spill Planet was a tiny insignificant world of the lower realms, a planet that was slightly larger than average.

As long as he knew the coordinates of the Sky Spill Planet, then with his strength he would be able to pass through the transmission array and arrive at the Sky Spill Planet in two to four hours.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s lips slowly curved up in a dreadful smile.

Because they died in such a tragic manner, this mountain range was called Tragic Death Mountain. This was a graveyard for masters but also a treasure trove of great lucky chances. Many martial artists came here to adventure in hopes of being able to gain enough insights and experience to break through to the next boundary and walk even further down their road of martial arts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was also because of this reason that even though this mountain range had endlessly great risks, there were still many extreme characters that came every year in order to temper themselves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Big Brother, we must be careful. Tragic Death Mountain is unfathomable. Sovereign Father has already advised us to listen to General Wei’s heeding, and the most we can enter into Tragic Death Mountain is about 400 miles.” The Divine Kingdom Princess riding the winged flood dragon said. She wore a military uniform and seemed extremely stern and martial, but this did not diminish her gentleness and stunning looks. She was a rare beauty. With her appearance and her background, she was the ideal woman that many young elites in the Divine Kingdom yearned for.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What the Princess says is right.

No one had seen this gray power before. But, if someone skilled in the Space Laws were to see this, they would know that this was the power of the space storm that leaked out from the crack in space. Moreover, this space storm originated from the spatial void that existed between the Divine Realm and the lower realms; it was a terrifying force that could annihilate all of existence!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a fast meteorite!” The young Prince cried out in alarm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd beside him, General Wei was also looking out far into the distance.
