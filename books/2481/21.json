Run for the corner where we are signaling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Corner? Corner?\" Jenni looked scattered and afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm! Stay calm, Jenni!\" Katie grabbed her shotgun, her backpack, and the bag of ammo and leaped out of the truck at the ready. She spotted a man standing next to the big yellow machine waving a Texas flag at her. \"There!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni followed, struggling to get her backpack on. Jason hopped out, backpack on, and the dog leaped out behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run,\" Katie said ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was in good shape, but not used to running with so much weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt slow and vulnerable, but the shotgun in her hand was a comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey raced past empty stores, long boarded up, \"for lease\" signs faded on their ruined doors. They raced past blood splatters on the sidewalk. They ran past empty cars, frightening with their open doors and windows. They ran across an old, red brick street and aimed for the large yellow arm of the construction beast extending down toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie wondered what the hell it was called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in, get in,\" a man\u0027s voice was yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was finding it harder to run. Her legs felt rubbery from all the time in the truck. Jenni and Jason were huffing behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lungs hurt, her back hurt, her body hurt, but she ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large scoop of the machine reached the road, encrusted with dirt, its jagged teeth somehow welcoming. They ran for it and heard the screeches of the undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run!\" A man\u0027s voice boomed out. \"Get into it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie reached it and whirled around in the direction of the moans and screams of the undead. The zombies were heading around the far corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni lost her footing and tumbled forward, but managed to fall into the clawed scoop. Jason jumped in after her. Katie heaved the dog in and Jason and Jenni grabbed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large scoop was pretty much filled and already lifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies were close and Katie considered firing, but realized it would waste time. The mechanical arm was lifting with a steady whine of its machinery and she half fell, half jumped into it. She was barely in it, lying on top of everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir view was shifted as they were lifted and Katie felt sickeningly vulnerable. She was trembling so violently she was sure she was going to vomit. The moans of the dead surrounded them and a hand, grisly and bloodied, grabbed onto one of the dirt encrusted teeth of the yellow construction beast. The arm was being swept up over the crowd, barely a few feet over the heads of the crazed zombies The hand of the zombie who had grabbed on was trying to get a better hold. Another hand, its other hand, fumbled at her foot. Katie was terrified to move for fear of rolling off Jason, Jenni and poor Jack and into the crowd below. She could only stare at the scrabbling hand in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack solved the problem. He grabbed the hand of the zombie, shook his head violently, and it lost its grip and fell. The machinery\u0027s arm lifted faster, higher and swung about. Katie felt herself slipping and Jason and Jenni grabbed onto her tighter. And the world tilted and they were being lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie lost her balance, slid, and painfully went over the teeth of the contraption. Instead of a plunge into the undead, she landed on soft soil. A man\u0027s hand came down and took hers gently and heaved her to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood on the edges of a large construction site. Two enormous buildings flanked its backside and one side. A small, elegant town hall fit into another corner. Only two edges of the site were open to the rest of the town and those were cut off with a hurricane fence. Beyond the fence was a ring of construction trucks that had dirt and bags of cement tucked underneath them and between the cabs and loads, making a secondary wall. But there was a third wall already being constructed within the hurricane fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready it was connecting one building to the city hall. A high wrought iron fence surrounded the city hall and its windows were covered in fancy ironwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was staggered by what she saw. The portable office buildings for the site were now residences, that was plain to see, and a lunch wagon was parked in a corner. Construction workers were moving fast to create a small fort the size of a city block for those taking refuge in the site. There were people clustered about to see the newcomers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a mall,\" Jenni sighed with relief as she staggered out of the crane\u0027s scoop. She was a bit dirty and rumpled but alive. Jason and Jack followed her, both looking very relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man holding Katie\u0027s hand finally came into view as she stopped looking around. He was taller than she was, sturdy in his build, with curly brown hair and the warmest hazel eyes she\u0027d ever seen. He radiated warmth, power, and kindness and his height and build spoke of a man used to hard work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, okay?\" he finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she nodded and looked at his hand. It was dirty, caked with dirt and bits of cement. \"That was scary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only way to get people in right now,\" he answered in a voice that would lead men into battle, not because they feared him, but loved him. \"I\u0027m Travis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie,\" she answered and slowly drew her hand away. He was like her father. One of those quietly strong men who inspired people to great things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, she knew Travis was behind the rapid building of this fortress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni stood next to her staring at the handsome man. \"Hi, I\u0027m Jenni and this is my son, Jason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis greeted them both with a gentle hello and a warm handshake. He kneeled down to greet Jack. \"I saw what you did. You\u0027re a good pup defending your Mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack grinned in response and licked his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis stood up again, tall and imposing, yet his presence was amazingly comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate realized, much to her surprise, that she felt safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis smiled at them and said, \"Give me a moment and I\u0027ll show you around.\" He turned to talk to the man who had manned the machine that had brought them over and a few other men who ran over to check in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not black,\" Katie joked under her breath to Jenni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027ll kiss him anyway,\" Jenni said dreamily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie lifted an eyebrow at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you won\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate just gave her a sly smile and shook her head slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis glanced over at them and Kate had to look away. She felt unnerved by his gaze and she had trouble understanding why. Something had happened when she had first looked at him. A knowledge had sprung strong and sure into her mind. This was now home. And Travis, somehow, was going to play a very important role in her life. That knowledge was almost too much to comprehend or sift through. She didn\u0027t even want to pick it apart and examine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back toward him and again she saw him looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows, too, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheels of destiny had turned and a new reality was already being spun into existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Jenni to see that she was in crush city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie smiled at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason, meanwhile, was playing with Jack, looking relieved, looking like he, too, felt safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re secure,\" someone said through a bullhorn and those in the \"fort\" cheered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis smiled at Kate and she smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWar buddies, her father\u0027s voice whispered through her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to fight this war together, Kate thought. You and me, Travis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re important and now that we\u0027re both here things are going to happen. Do you feel it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t surprise her when Travis looked her way again and something strong and invisible passed between them. Not a jolt of sexual attraction between sexes, but the knowledge that someone profound had entered their life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in his gaze, she knew, he felt it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. The New World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis motioned to an older man standing on the back steps of the quaint little city hall. The older, balding man with the rotund belly nodded and headed back into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni let her backpack fall to the ground with a thunk and shook out her hair to get all the caked mud out of it. But there was a flare to the movement, a bit of feminine guile tingeing her movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie smiled even bigger. Jenni was trying to get Travis\u0027 attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked toward them, dirty, tired, but smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, sorry, things are a little crazy right now. Your arrival really surprised us. We had a truck driver arrive a few hours ago. Honestly, at this point, we weren\u0027t sure anyone was left out there that was alive.\" Travis set his hands on his hips and shook his head. \"We were listening to the Emergency Broadcast but nothing made sense. They don\u0027t\u0027 seem to have a clue in hell what is going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zombies,\" Jenni said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, grinned, and nodded. \"Yeah, zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you figure out what was going on? This had to have gone up immediately,\" Katie said motioning all around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yesterday we were supposed to break ground. We were going to rebuild a historical building that burned down a few years ago. This whole area is about to undergo a serious-or was going to undergo- a serious reconstruction. A developer was keen on turning it into a tourist attraction complete with the rebuilt vaudeville theater and the hotel,\" he pointed to one of the tall redbrick buildings \"being the focal points. Anyway, I was on my way here to work when the reports started coming in.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-21.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
