{"id":99631,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24th of August, 1819\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight was abominable. I do not know how I survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this evening-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stared pensively out the front window of the Golden Krone Hotel, awaiting the arrival of my lord and Master, Count Vlad Dracula, I sipped burning brandy that did little to soothe my nerves. The letter from Andrew Wright felt heavy in my coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all my years of serving the Count, I have never borne the brunt of his anger, and I did not anticipate enduring it now. I had seen him unleash his wrath against those who failed him with a brutality that is terrifying. Now, I feared I would fall victim to his anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thick fog rolled slowly down the street, dark and menacing as it undulated in great waves over the flagstones. I knew this could only mean one thing. The Master had arrived. I took a deep breath as my heart began to race. Black horses waded through the gloom drawing a carriage up to the front entrance of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set down my drink and hurried to the front door. An employee of the hotel rushed to open the carriage door, and I anxiously followed him. Running a hand over my hair, I tried to steady my nerves and look presentable to the Count. He is, after all, a very particular man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and, instead of descending, the Count’s long, cruel hand slid out of the darkness within the carriage to beckon me. I quickly clambered up into the carriage as the driver began to toss down heavy traveling bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Count sat comfortably in the darkness, his auburn hair falling to his waist in curls. Dressed impressively in a black evening suit, he stroked his short beard thoughtfully as he regarded my expression. I quickly kissed the large ring on his hand and took the seat across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master, it is good to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dear friend, you seem worried.” The cold green eyes stood out vividly in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and quickly found I was unable to continue. I was utterly terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come now. Tell me. What has happened? I can tell by your demeanor that all is not well. Is something amiss in my business dealings?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir, no. It is just that a matter has come to my attention that concerns your plans to move to England.” I reached into my coat pocket and handed the Count the letter I had received from Andrew Wright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?” The Count took the letter, his long nails seeming particularly threatening this night. Count Dracula opened the letter and read it with some interest. I saw his brows knit together and my hands began to tremble. “I thought I told you that no one was to know of the Wright’s visit to my castle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did, sir. But my wife was given the letter the day they departed and she did not consult with me. She posted the letter without my knowledge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at me. “You should have more control over your wife, my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feared for Maria in that moment and gulped down a desperate breath of air. “I should have told her to hand over all the letters to me. I do apologize, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slightly waved his hand at me. “I advise you to make it clear to your beloved wife that you are her master. I will not have her interfering in my plans again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir. I understand, sir. I will make it quite plain to her upon my return home. But, sir, I do not know what to do. I do not know how to respond to his letter.” My words were rushed in a trembling voice. I despised myself for being so afraid, but the Master always instills fear in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Count sat back in his seat, the leather rustling beneath him, and sighed. “I had confidence in you, Stephen. It is such a shame you have failed me in this one simple request.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m terribly sorry, sir. More than I can ever say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it is of no matter. I think I shall be able to use this situation to my advantage. Yes, yes, it may be a blessing. Perhaps I shall be able to leave for England sooner than I expected.” The Count smiled, his pearl fangs glinting. “Now, get out of my carriage. The night is young, and I wish to enjoy the pleasures of the city.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, sir!” I hurried climbed out. “Shall we speak later, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Then we can discuss business.” The Count fell back into the shadows of the carriage as the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sharp order from the driver, the horses trotted on and the carriage of Count Dracula rolled into the foggy night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelighted by my narrow escape, I allowed myself a small sigh of relief before rushing back into the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, he arrived looking quite rosy of face, his eyes glinting with a keen fever, and I knew he had fed well. We sat together in my hotel room to discuss his business and his demeanor was refreshingly cordial. I sat at a small desk and he sat across from me, tapping the writing paper lightly with one finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will write to Andrew Wright and inform him of the most unfortunate event that befell his family in route to my home. There was a terrible storm and their carriage was swept off the road into the river. Only his sister, Glynis, survived, and she is in my care. She has been horribly injured, but I am tending to her medical needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote down all that he instructed me, my fingers slightly trembling. “You…you did make her…what you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not understand…if she is a vampire, then why not say she is dead as well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After a time, Glynis will recover, and I will marry her. Or so her brother will think. Then we shall enlist his aid in moving his beloved sister and her husband to England.” The Count smiled wolfishly. “You see, it quite works out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see, that yes, he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sink further into his deceit, I find that I am relieved that it is not me who will suffer at the hands of Count Dracula. Tomorrow we travel to Buda to set our plans in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Lady Glynis Wright\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e27th of August, 1819\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shall try and describe the hell we endured in his absence…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur screams have rent the night since we woke in the throes of the hunger. I was the first to run to the great doors and beat upon them with my fists. I heard my sisters rushing behind me and turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriana ran dreamily down the long staircase, her long white gown flowing around her like great wings. She looked like an angel and, for a mad moment, I wished she would carry me up to heaven out of this hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElina threw herself over the railing of the great staircase, her hair fanning around her like a black halo. Cneajna fell to her knees in the center of the grand foyer, screaming. I smashed my fists against the enormous door that led to the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunger was driving us to insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrapped in the castle for days, the gypsies safely locked out, we have been starving. Since Vlad had abruptly left us alone, deliberately chained to this dark corrupt castle by his power, we had not fed. We could not escape to feed and we were on the verge of madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur bodies and faces had thinned, and we looked strangely inhuman. Our eyes were deep-set, our limbs sinewy. Our hearts had ceased to beat and our bodies became a pale gray. We looked like wraiths. Elina landed beside me and raked her nails feverishly over the darkened wood, splinters tearing into her fingers. We were desperate and beyond reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriana ran down the stairs, her hands clutching an ancient sword. Rushing past Cneajna, she raised it over her head, jamming it into the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help me! Help me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was weeping; the hunger so painful that I felt I was being ripped apart into tiny pieces. Grasping the hilt, I helped Ariana in her attempt to pry open the lock. Elina joined her hands with ours, and together we tried to break open the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCneajna huddled on the floor behind us, clawing at her hair in despair. I felt the metal began to bend, and I cried out with relief. “It is opening!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCneajna threw herself at us and grabbed hold of the sword. We were all so very weak. Together we strained as the metal slowly bent and the wood splintered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There! We have done it!” Elina exclaimed, her fingers tugging at the giant latch. The sword clanged to the stone floor. I pulled on the door with all my might and it swung open on rusted hinges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! Yes!” Cneajna gasped in delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crisp night air fanned over us as we crouched together in the doorway. The invisible barrier erected by Prince Vlad’s dark powers still kept us from racing into the night, but somehow, just seeing the evening sky hovering over the courtyard gave us a measure of solace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the hunger still raged within us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will starve. If no one comes, we will starve!” Elina collapsed to her knees, clutching the door in anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriana began to wail with fear and hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my body against the power holding us captive. I could not break through it. Screaming, I pressed my body against the invisible shield and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Sir Stephen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4th of September, 1819\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount Dracula’s new plans are now set in motion. He seems quite pleased with the situation, and I can only feel a sense of relief. Despite my admiration for the man, I do admit that he frightens me deeply. That he could take our potentially difficult predicament and use it to serve his purposes is a profound reminder that he was once a great Prince of Wallachia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all had been settled in Buda, it was decided that we would travel back to the castle together. I would then continue on alone to see to the sale of one of his properties to finance his newest endeavor. I was not very comfortable traveling such a great length with the Prince, but I fortified myself with the thought of regaining his trust. Throughout our time together, I have noticed him watching me with acute scrutiny. It frightens me terribly. I am determined to sweep away any mistrust he may have in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave it to an infernal woman to cause me such despair!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount Dracula was surprisingly entertaining during our trip. He recounted many of his great exploits in years past without the usual bitterness he expresses when remembering all the betrayals he suffered as a mortal. I admit his joviality frightened me somewhat. It was so unexpected. I suppose I have become accustomed to his arrogance and his sharpness. To see him smile so widely was rather unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it is because he is no longer a man, but it always startles me how easily he sits in a swaying and jolting carriage. I sat across from him, holding tightly to the safety straps, fearing for my very life. Yet he sat there, talking to me, gesturing casually, his green eyes glinting at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am certain he was amused by my white knuckles and terrified expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, he became quite amused. His disturbing laugh filled the darkness of the carriage as we traveled toward the decaying remains of his once impressive castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are really in quite an uproar. Screaming and carrying on.” Count Dracula chuckled as he slapped his gloves against my knee. “Women!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced a laugh, not certain what he was speaking of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear my wives. They are quite upset that I have been gone for so long,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes. Your wives! I only have one wife, thank goodness. You have three! How do you stand it? Women can be so insufferable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Four wives,” the Count said. “Remember, Glynis is now my Bride. And yes, they are all insufferable in their own way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to look uncomfortable, and nodded. “Oh, yes, Lady Glynis. I was rather surprised that you…changed her. I mean, sir, I know that you said you fancied her, but I thought perhaps the hunting was rather scarce up here and you needed…” I faltered in my words. I always grow nervous when discussing the vampire thirst for blood. Though I have served Count Dracula for more than twelve years now, I am always aware of the possibility of him turning on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount Dracula flashed his long teeth as he smiled. “My dear friend, the hunting is always good up in the mountains. Especially now that the British Empire has expanded and young English aristocrats are exploring the world. I rather like the English. Their rational minds will not accept what their eyes see. It is rather amusing to hear them screaming that I do not exist.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-26.html","bookId":2614,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM"}
