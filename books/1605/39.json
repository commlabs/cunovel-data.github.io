It\u0027s like saying you\u0027re with Will. No one can own something that magnanimous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what that word means. I almost wonder if he knows what he\u0027s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re bigger than one person. Look at her, she\u0027s smiling and flirting and being friendly. She is making that whole group of people happy. She\u0027s like the Mother-somebody from before. The nun who went around and healed the sick and fed them and shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"I don’t know. I\u0027m not Catholic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes, \"Everyone knew who she was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start ignoring his talk and notice the faces of the people talking with Will. Their eyes dart at me. He crosses his arms. He\u0027s getting angry. His hands are in fists. Suddenly Star shows up and smiles and touches their hands and Will\u0027s. She shakes her head and they start seeing what she\u0027s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027re talking about me?\" I ask nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake nods, \"Oh, hell yes.\" He watches too. Allan is gone. I cuss under my breath and look around for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie is gone too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and see Anna next to Will and Star. She has the same outgoing personality as Star, but the sense of Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Jake, \"We gotta find Bernie and Allan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points, \"Bernie is over there. He\u0027s talking to a guy on the other side of Will. Looks like he\u0027s in on the cause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scans the tents and trees and points after a minute, \"Allan is over there. He\u0027s chatting up a lady with a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand on my tiptoes and watch him talking to her. She looks mid twenties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake makes a face, \"Ewww, he\u0027s trying to pick up. She has a baby. What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and point to the path, \"Wanna go swimming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and we walk away. We get to the bottom of the path and the flat rock, and my stomach hurts like I\u0027m doing something wrong. The guilty feeling is back. I look over at Jake taking his shirt off and shake off the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around.\" He does and I pull my pants, shirt and boots off and jump in, in my underwear. The water feels amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun is setting but the heat of the day is still there. It never really goes away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The water is warmer,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore him and paddle about. The water is the cleanest feeling I get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake splashes me. I splash him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lunges at me and dunks me. I kick at him and scramble to swim away. He grabs my foot and drags me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come up for air, to see Will standing on the flat rock. Jake dunks me again. The guilty feeling comes back instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kick Jake hard and come up for air. Jake comes up and wraps his arms around my bare chest. He drags me down into the water, growling like a bear. I see the water stir up and know Will has dove in. I come up for air. Jake is laughing. I look around, \"Did Will get in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wipes his face, \"I didn’t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath feels too loud, like I should be still and wait for Will to surface. I don’t see him though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he jump in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shakes his head, \"I didn’t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw him at the shore and then the water stirred. Do you think he\u0027s holding his breath?\" Panic starts to fill my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this long.\" We swim to the edge of the pool but there is nothing but our clothes and the flat rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him, \"Do you think he thought something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"We were swimming. We weren’t doing anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s close to me, too close. I look down at my breasts and shake my head, \"Look away. I\u0027m going to get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his face in the other direction. I climb out and pull on my shirt. The dark t-shirt covers me. When I pull my pants up, I see him watching. I point, \"I said look away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"You took too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my gaze, \"Hurry up. It\u0027s getting dark and the teenagers come to mess around when the sun goes down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"Maybe I wanna mess around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw my arms in the air, \"What\u0027s your deal? You\u0027re messing around with Star already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"You don’t even like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"That’s not fair. I don’t even know her. It doesn’t matter, she\u0027s my sister and your brother and I are… well you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe splashes water at me, \"What, Em? What are you two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my boyfriend, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"I love how weird you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and leave him there. I stomp up the path. I get halfway when Will walks down to meet me. He still looks angry. I swallow, \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folds his arms across his huge chest, \"You sent a lady with a baby to hit on me, so you could sneak off and skinny dip with my brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw drops. I realize how the two look like they could be related. A nervous giggle leaves my lips, \"It\u0027s not what it looks like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJakes comes up the trail behind me. I could hear him from a mile. He stands too close, dripping wet still. Will\u0027s eyes lift to meet him directly behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" he asks Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having a swim, trying to tempt your girlfriend to wrestle naked with me. You know, regular shit.\" The tone in Jake’s voice is mocking. He\u0027s angry about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill clenches his jaw, \"Why don\u0027t you go see where your girlfriend is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, you want to fuck her again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s face flinches. Jake nudges me as he walks past us. My heartbeat rages inside of me. I can see the truth on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God,\" I feel instantly sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel hot tears flooding my eyes, \"Oh God, it was since we met, wasn’t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a wide birth but he grabs my arm, \"Baby, it\u0027s not what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rip my arm from his grip but he grabs me hard. I slip, dropping my boots and bow and quiver. I drop to my knees in the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see his hands shaking. He wants to grab me and shake me and make me listen but he doesn’t. He drops to his knees too and starts picking up my stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was when you were at the breeder farm,\" his voice is hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and plug my ears with my dirty fingers, \"I don’t want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my hand roughly, \"It was a mistake. I knew it then. I drank way too much. I thought you were gone forever. It was a mistake. I never imagined in a million years, you would get out. I knew you wouldn’t leave without Anna. I\u0027ve seen inside of those places. I knew what I was sending you there for. I let you go there so my baby sister wouldn’t die alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my hands from his, \"But you lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he talks it looks like his words taste bad, \"I never wanted to do it. I was sleeping in my tent and she came. I never wanted her like that. I felt sick after what I\u0027d seen done to her at the farms, and I did the same thing. I used her. I never loved her. It makes me sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you lied. You lied about having sex, with my sister.\" The words taste bad for me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down, shaking his head, \"I didn’t think you\u0027d understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my quiver and bow and boots roughly, \"Well I don’t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up, \"Babe, don’t leave me. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl at him, \"I need you to finish the job I have to do. I can\u0027t leave you. I have to kill Marshall and my dad.\" He swallows, looking hopeful, but I cut him off, \"But me and you, that’s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stomp past him. He grabs at me. I pull an arrow, dropping the boots and quiver at the same moment. I pull back and release, grazing his shoulder with the tip. He cries out. I grab another arrow and run up the hill. He\u0027s up and after me, I turn and pull it back hard. He walks up to my arrow with blood dripping down his shoulder, \"We aren’t over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod my head, \"We are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes are ice, \"Then release the arrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Don’t make me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans into it further. My arms and hands are burning. I release the tension, dropping my arm and the arrow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans into me more, \"If you need time to get past this, fine. But I\u0027m not playing around. I love you. You have my whole heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, looking down, \"Will, you don’t have a heart. You\u0027re just like every other man out there, except Bernie and Jake. And I\u0027m not even sure about Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away and walk up the hill with my bow. I don’t even go back for my quiver and my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb into the tent me and Anna used last time and curl into the blankets. She comes in a minute later and snuggles into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know now don’t you?\" she whispers into my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod sniffling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least nobody died, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. She is so much like Bernie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggle into her and listen as the music starts up at the fire. I hear Jake and a girl singing. Anna starts snoring, which doesn\u0027t make much sense, since she can\u0027t make other noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hear the sound of our tent zipper. I sit up, ready for a fight but it\u0027s just Will. He drops my boots and quiver and climbs in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and point at the door, \"Go.\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear me out, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crawls to me, not listening at all. He lays down on my pillow, \"I fucked up so bad. I know we weren’t together at the time and you liked Jake a lot. I didn’t think I stood a chance with you. I made such a mistake, kissing you in the woods that day, when we first met. I just had to. I don’t know why. I came off as a smug ass. That’s not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t want to hear this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I liked you instantly. You know how they say love at first sight? I think I had that. There you were, with that big wolf, and that mean scowl, and a surly teenager. You were savage and crazy, but at the same time, the most loyal person I\u0027d ever met. You were ready to die for the people you were looking for. And then, when you said you knew where my family was, I nearly kissed you then. You were ready to die for my family. I acted like a dick. I saw your face when you saw Jake, and I was pissed. I knew he\u0027d gotten there before me and he was the better man. He deserved you and I didn’t. I fucked up.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-39.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
