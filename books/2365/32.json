On this night he was watching Rigoletto at the San Francisco Opera House and enjoying every minute of it. He was seated in a box with Lauren Harrison and her father. In the lobby of the opera house during intermission, Alex Harrison had introduced him to a large number of friends. \"This is my future son-in-law and a brilliant doctor, Ken Mallory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing Alex Harrison\u0027s son-in-law was enough to make him a brilliant doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the performance, the Harrisons and Mallory went to the Fairmont Hotel for supper in the elegant main dining room. Mallory enjoyed the deferential greeting that the mattre d\u0027 gave to Alex Harrison as he led them to their booth. From now on, I\u0027ll be able to afford places like this, Mallory thought, and everyone is going to know who I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they had ordered, Lauren said, \"Darling, I think we should have a party to announce our engagement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good idea!\" her father said. \"We\u0027ll make it a big one. What do you say, Ken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warning bell sounded in Mallory\u0027s mind. An engagement party would mean publicity. I\u0027ll have to set Kat straight first. A little money should take care of that. Mallory cursed the stupid bet he had made. For a mere ten thousand dollars, his whole shining future might now be in jeopardy. He could just imagine what would happen if he tried to explain Kat to the Harrisons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the way, I forgot to mention that I\u0027m already engaged to a doctor at the hospital. She\u0027s black... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr: Do you want to hear something funny? I bet the boys at the hospital ten thousand dollars I could fuck this black doctor... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr: / already have one wedding planned... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he thought, I\u0027ll have to find a way to buy Kat off-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were looking at Mallory expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory smiled. \"A party sounds like a wonderful idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren said enthusiastically, \"Good. I\u0027ll get things started. You men have no idea what it takes to give a party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Harrison turned to Mallory. \"I\u0027ve already started the ball rolling for you, Ken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gary Gitlin, the head of North Shore Hospital, is an old golf buddy of mine. I talked to him about you, he doesn\u0027t think there will be any problem about having you affiliated with his hospital. That\u0027s quite prestigious, you know. And at the same time, I\u0027ll get you set up in your own practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory listened, filled with a sense of euphoria. \"That\u0027s wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, it will take a few years to build up a really lucrative practice, but I think you should be able to make two or three hundred thousand dollars the first year or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo or three hundred thousand! My God! Mallory thought. He makes it sound like peanuts. \"That ... That would be very nice, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Harrison smiled. \"Ken, since I\u0027m going to be your father-in-law, let\u0027s get off this \u0027sir\u0027 business. Call me Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I\u0027ve never been a June bride,\" Lauren said. \"Is June all right with you, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear Kat\u0027s voice saying: Don\u0027t you think we should set a date? I thought maybe June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory took Lauren\u0027s hand in his. \"That sounds great.\" That will give me plenty of time to handle Kat, Mallory decided. He smiled to himself. I\u0027ll offer her some of the money I won getting her into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a yacht in the south of France,\" Alex Harrison was saying, \"Would you two like to honeymoon on the French Riviera? You can fly over in our Gulfstream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA yacht. The French Riviera. It was like a fantasy come true. Mallory looked at Lauren. \"I\u0027d honeymoon anywhere with Lauren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Harrison nodded. \"Well, it looks like everything is settled.\" He smiled at his daughter. \"I\u0027m going to miss you, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not losing me, Father. You\u0027re gaining a doctor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Harrison nodded. \"And a damn good one. I can never thank you enough for saving my life, Ken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren stroked Mallory\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027ll thank him for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ken, why don\u0027t we have lunch next week?\" Alex Harrison said. \"We\u0027ll pick out some decent office space for you, maybe in the Post Building, and I\u0027ll make a date for you to see Gary Gitlin. A lot of my friends are dying to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you might rephrase that, Father,\" Lauren suggested. She turned to Ken. \"I\u0027ve been talking to my friends about you and they\u0027re eager to meet you, too, only I\u0027m not going to let them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested in anyone but you,\" Mallory said warmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they got into their chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, Lauren asked, \"Where can we drop you, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hospital. I\u0027ve got to check on a few patients.\" I He had no intention of seeing any patients. Kat was on I duty at the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren stroked his cheek. \"My poor baby. You work I much too hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory sighed. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. As long as I\u0027m helping people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Kat in the geriatric ward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Kat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in an angry mood. \"We had a date last night, Ken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m sorry. I wasn\u0027t able to make it, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the third time in the last week. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was becoming a boring nag. \"Kat, I have to talk to you. Is there an empty room around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought for a moment. \"A patient checked out of 315. Let\u0027s go in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started down the corridor. A nurse walked up to them. \"Oh, Dr. Mallory! Dr. Peterson has been looking for you. He - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I\u0027m busy.\" He took Kat by the arm and led her to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrived at the third floor, they walked silently down the corridor and went into Room 315. Mallory closed the door behind them. He was hyperventilating. His whole golden future depended on the next few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took Kat\u0027s hand in his. It was time to be sincere. \"Kat, you know I\u0027m crazy about you. I\u0027ve never felt about anyone the way I feel about you. But, honey, the idea of having a baby right now ... well ... can\u0027t you see how wrong it would be? I mean ...we\u0027re both working day and night, we aren\u0027t making enough money to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can manage,\" Kat said. \"I love you, Ken, and I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. All I\u0027m asking is that we put everything off for a little while. Let me finish my term at the hospital and get started in private practice somewhere. Maybe we\u0027ll go back East. In a few years we\u0027ll be able to afford to get married and have a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a few years\u0027? But I told you, I\u0027m pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, darling, but it\u0027s been what, now ... two months? There\u0027s still plenty of time to abort it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat looked at him, shocked. \"No! I won\u0027t abort it. I want us to get married right away. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a yacht in the south of France. Would you two like to honeymoon on the French Riviera? You can fly over in our Gulf stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already told Paige and Honey that we\u0027re getting married. They\u0027re going to be my bridesmaids. And I told them about the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory felt a cold chill go through him. Things were getting out of hand. If the Harrisons got wind of this, he would be finished. \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory forced a smile. \"I want to keep our private lives private.\" I\u0027ll get you set up in your own practice... . You should be able to make two or three hundred thousand dollars the first year or two. \"Kat, I\u0027m going to ask you this for the last time. Will you have an abortion?\" He was willing her to say yes, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kat ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t, Ken. I told you how I felt about the abortion I had as a girl. I swore I could never live through such a thing again. Don\u0027t ask me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was at that moment that Ken Mallory realized he could not take a chance. He had no choice. He was going to have to kill her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-32.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
