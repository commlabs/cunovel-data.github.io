{"id":96638,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t able to see Brandon until the following day at school, and I was so hungry to tell him the latest details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember those weird guys that I saw at the convenience store and the mall? They showed up near my house.\" We sat on the school\u0027s front steps as I told Brandon all about what had transpired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I had known what was going on at the mall,\" he said. \"I would have jumped out of the doctor\u0027s office and come right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had a good reason to be somewhere else. Is your grandmother all right?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should be asking if you are okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m okay.\" I smiled sweetly. \"What did the doctor say about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To beware of the full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. But then he grinned, and we both laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just her annual checkup,\" Brandon went on. \"I can\u0027t believe I wasn\u0027t there for you,\" he lamented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m fine. Just a bit shaken up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are these guys?\" he wondered. \"Why have they come to town? And why are they bothering you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of them said that they\u0027ve come for the Legend\u0027s Run Werewolf Fest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s a week away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But I might know why. I think they are werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" he asked with concern. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way one of them eyed Champ. Champ was barking and growling. Then Ryder stared at him, and Champ lay down as if he were ready for a nap. It\u0027s the same skill you\u0027ve had since you transformed. Nash did it to Apollo, too, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon turned away from me as if he was really hit by this news. \"There are more werewolves than just me and Nash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This can\u0027t have happened,\" Brandon said. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But I am convinced that they are werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This can\u0027t be happening,\" Brandon reiterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m freaking out, too,\" I conceded. \"And what if they aren\u0027t like you and Nash? You saw it - Nash isn\u0027t the same kind of werewolf you are. He\u0027s mean. These guys are rude by day - imagine what they\u0027d be like if they turn at night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have enough to deal with already.\" Brandon was clearly worried. \"This isn\u0027t fair. How can we handle everything at once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was overwhelmed, too. \"We\u0027ll have to think of something. They said they were looking for new friends. I think I know what they mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to me. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again. \"I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let anyone hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. But what if they want all of us? You can\u0027t be everywhere!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash will be taking the serum soon. Then at least he will hopefully be normal. But now you think there are more? I haven\u0027t got a cure for all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if that is what they\u0027re after. They seem like a gang. I think they might be searching for more members.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More werewolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.... They seemed so interested in me - and Ivy and Abby. I can\u0027t have my friends in jeopardy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do?\" he wondered, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should ask Nash to wait to take the cure in case we need help with these new werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t ask him that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I will,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can handle this alone. I can handle this alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure we have that choice. Dr. Meadows warned me - so if it isn\u0027t you or Nash...it might be - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of them?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was truly frightened. My eyes filled with tears. My whole life was so far out of hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to find them before the full moon,\" Brandon said just as first bell rang. After class, I caught up to Nash at his locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to you,\" I said hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me first,\" he said. \"I want to tell you and Brandon thank you. I\u0027ve been acting so strangely lately. I know it\u0027s the full moon approaching. But the only thing that is saving me from going crazy is knowing that I\u0027ll be able to take that serum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I want to talk to you about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. \"He doesn\u0027t have it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was relieved. But then his bright expression darkened. \"He\u0027s not going to let me have it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you just listen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Go ahead,\" he said impatiently. \"But I do want to say this: When I am normal, things can be right again between us. He\u0027ll still be a werewolf - with all the unpredictable events that go along with it. But you should be with someone you can count on. You deserve that, Celeste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your looking out for me,\" I said as sweetly as I could. \"But this isn\u0027t about us. You understand I am with Brandon - whether he is a werewolf or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes. \"A guy can try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to understand that.\" I wanted Nash to know where we stood - for now and the future - and do it in a kind and sympathetic way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes,\" he said. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I need your help this time. For me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Just tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something that happened in the last few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These guys that came to town - you might have heard about them from Ivy and Abby. They are here for the Werewolf Festival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they the creepers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. That\u0027s them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And I\u0027m afraid of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed at me earnestly. \"Me, Jake, and Dylan can straighten them out,\" he said. \"I have no problem kicking their - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can,\" Nash said, his chest puffed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But there is something else you can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t take the serum on the full moon,\" I said, looking at him with my eyes wide and pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you insane? Why would I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash, I think they might not be just regular guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what kind of guys are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they are werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was shocked. As if he couldn\u0027t comprehend any more werewolves other than him and Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him intently. \"And I think they are searching for others - girls - to join their pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get that in your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one guy - Ryder - stared down Champ like you did Apollo, like Brandon did in the wolf enclosure at the zoo. The only humans I\u0027ve seen who can do that are also werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can that be?\" he asked. \"More werewolves in town? I\u0027ve never even heard of this Ryder guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are from Huntington. And I think they want to try to turn me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Nash was the calm one, being helpful to me. \"You don\u0027t know for sure that they really are werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, Nash. I\u0027ve seen it with you and Brandon. I know what these guys are. And remember Dr. Meadows\u0027s prediction? If you aren\u0027t the one who is going to bite me, that means one of them is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027ll have to do something,\" he said. \"No one is going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt relieved by his protectiveness toward me and decided I could ask him the tough question. \"Will you delay taking the serum until the following full moon? I need you to be as fast and strong as they are so Brandon will not be all alone. You have to be on Brandon\u0027s side, as a werewolf, in case they try anything crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooted back and looked away. Then he leaned in again. \"I can help - and I will help. But as a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You won\u0027t wait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait. I have to be normal again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But can\u0027t you even at least think about it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hand on mine. \"I can do more as myself than I can as a werewolf, Celeste. I am a monster when I turn - uncontrollable. I still might be the one that would be biting you. I can\u0027t take that chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please do it for me,\" I begged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am - I\u0027m taking it for us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash, when have I ever asked you to do anything? How can you say no to this? It\u0027s only one more month!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are asking me to not be normal anymore. And now that I remember everything - I know what\u0027s in my heart. I can\u0027t be the one who hurts you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am asking you to do something for me. For once in your life not to leave me just sitting on the sidelines, helping you.\" I was so exasperated with his selfishness. \"Uh, Brandon was right. He can do this on his own. I was stupid to think you cared about anything but yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from Nash and stormed off. I could sense his bewilderment as I left him sitting alone, students staring at him as they walked down the stairs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-9.html","bookId":2150,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM"}
