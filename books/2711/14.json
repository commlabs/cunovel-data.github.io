It’s awkward singing them with him only a few feet away. When I wrote the lyrics the first time, he was playing his guitar but was a good two hundred yards away on his balcony. Still, though, as much as I tried to pretend I was writing them about Hunter at the time, I knew I was imagining Ridge singing them all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LITTLE BIT MORE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy don’t you let me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake you away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can live like you wanted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom place to place\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be your home\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can make our own\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuz together makes it pretty hard to be alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can have everything you ever wanted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe just a little bit more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a little bit more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis guitar stops, so naturally, I stop. I open my eyes, and he’s watching me with one of his expressionless expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take that back. This expression isn’t expressionless at all. He’s thinking. I can tell by the squint in his eyes that he’s coming up with an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances away in order to pick up his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge: Do you mind if I try something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: As long as you promise never again to propose a question by asking if I mind if you can try something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge: Nice try, but that made no sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, then look up at him. I nod softly, scared of what he’s about to “try.” He sits up on his knees and leans forward, placing both hands on my shoulders. I attempt to hold in my gasp, but it’s a failed attempt. I don’t know what he’s doing or why he’s getting so close to me, but holy crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is my heart spazzing out right now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes me until I’m flat on his mattress. He reaches behind him and picks up his guitar, then lays it on the other side of me. He lies down next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm down, heart. Please. Ridge has supersonic senses, and he’ll feel you beating through the vibrations of the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge scoots closer to me and by the way he’s hesitating, it makes me think he’s unsure if I’ll allow him any closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will. I absolutely will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s staring at me now, contemplating his next move. I can tell he’s not about to make a pass at me. Whatever he’s about to do is making him way more apprehensive than if he were just planning to kiss me. He’s eyeing my neck and chest as if he’s searching for a particular part of me. His eyes stop on my abdomen, pause, then fall back to his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Lord. What is he about to do? Put his hands on me? Does he want to feel me sing this song? Feeling requires touching, and touching requires hands. His hands. Feeling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge: Do you trust me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I don’t trust anyone anymore. My trust has been completely depleted this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge: Can you replenish your trust for about five minutes? I want to feel your voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inhale, then look at him—lying next to me—and I nod. He sets down his phone without breaking my gaze. He’s watching me as if he’s warning me to stay calm, but it’s having the exact opposite effect. I’m sort of panicked right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoots closer and slides his arm under the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he’s even closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow his face is hovering over mine. He reaches across my body and pulls the guitar flush against my side, bringing it closer to us. He’s still eyeing me with a look that seems intended to produce a calming effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t. It doesn’t calm me down at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers his head to my chest, then presses his cheek against my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, this is great. Now he definitely feels how spastic my heart is beating right now. I close my eyes and want to die of embarrassment, but I don’t have time for that, because he begins strumming the strings of the guitar next to me. I realize he’s playing with both hands, one from underneath my head and one over me. His head is against my chest, and I can feel his hair brush my neck. He’s pretty much sprawled across me in order to reach his guitar with both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my dear sweet baby Jesus in a wicker basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does he expect me to sing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to calm down by regulating my breathing, but it’s hard when we’re positioned like this. As usual when I miss an intro, he seamlessly starts the song over again from the beginning. When he reaches the point where I come in, I begin singing. Sort of. It’s really quiet, because I’m still waiting for air to find its way back into my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the first few lines, I find a steadiness to my voice. I close my eyes and do my best to imagine I’m simply sitting up on his bed right now the way I have been for the last hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll bring my suitcase\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou bring that old lamp\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can live by the book\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we can never go back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling the breeze\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever felt so right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll watch the stars until they turn into light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can have everything you’ve ever wanted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe just a little bit more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a little bit more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finishes the last chord but doesn’t move. His hands remain stilled on his guitar. His ear remains firmly pressed against my chest. My breaths are heavier now that I’ve just sung an entire song, and his head rises with each intake of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs a deep sigh, then lifts his head and rolls onto his back without making eye contact with me. We sit in silence for a few minutes. I’m not sure why he’s being so unresponsive, but I’m too nervous to make any sudden movements. His arm is still underneath me, and he’s making no effort to remove it, so I’m not even sure if he’s finished with this little experiment yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m also not sure I’d even be able to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney, Sydney, Sydney. What are you doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI absolutely, positively, do not want to be having this reaction right now. It’s been a week since I broke up with Hunter. The very last thing I want—or even need—is to develop a crush on this guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I’m thinking that may have happened before this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilt my head and look at him. He’s watching me, but I can’t tell what his face is trying to convey. If I had to guess, I’d say he’s thinking, Oh, hey, Sydney. Our mouths sure are close together. Let’s do them a favor and close this gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes drop to my mouth, and I’m incredibly impressed with my telepathic abilities. His full lips are slightly parted as he quietly takes in several slow, deep breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can actually hear him breathing, which surprises me, because that’s another of his sounds that he keeps complete and total control over. I like that he can’t seem to control it right now. As much as I claim to want to be unattached from guys and independent and strong, the only thing I’m thinking is how much I wish he would take complete and total control over me. I want him to dominate this situation by rolling on top of me and forcing that incredible mouth onto mine, rendering me completely dependent on him for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone receives a text, interrupting my clearly overactive imagination. Ridge closes his eyes and turns to face the opposite direction. I sigh, knowing he didn’t even hear the text, so turning away was of his own accord. Which means I’m feeling pretty awkward right now for just having that rich internal dialogue sweep through my mind. I reach behind my head and feel around until I find my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter: Are you ready to talk yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. Way to ruin the moment, Hunter. I was hoping that after days of avoiding his texts and phone calls, he would finally get a clue. I shake my head and text him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Your behavior is bordering on harassment. Stop contacting me. We’re done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop with the guilt trip, Ridge. You didn’t do anything wrong. You aren’t doing anything wrong. Your heart is beating like this simply because you’ve never felt anyone sing before. It was overwhelming. You had a normal reaction to an overwhelming event. That’s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are still closed, and my arm is still underneath her. I should move it, but I’m still trying to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I really want to hear another song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might be making her uncomfortable, but I have to get her to push through her discomfort, because I can’t think of any other situation where I’ll be able to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Can I play another one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s holding her phone, texting someone who’s not me. I wonder if she’s texting Hunter, but I don’t peek at her phone, as much as I want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney: Okay. The first one didn’t do anything for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. I think it did a little too much, in more ways than I’d like to admit. I’m almost positive it was also obvious to her by the end of the song, with the way I was pressed against her. But feeling her voice and what it was doing to all the other parts of me was way more important than what she was doing to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I’ve never “listened” to anyone like that before. It was incredible. I don’t even know how to describe it. I mean, you were here, and you were the one singing, so I guess you don’t really need me to describe it. But I don’t know. I wish you could have felt that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney: You’re welcome, I guess. I’m not really doing anything profound here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I’ve always wanted to feel someone sing one of my songs, but it would be a little awkward doing this with one of the guys in the band. Know what I mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, then nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I’ll play the one we practiced last night, and then I want to play this last one again. Are you okay? If you’re tired of singing, just tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney: I’m good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lays down her phone, and I reposition myself against her chest. My entire body is battling itself. My left brain is telling me this is somehow wrong, my right brain is wanting to hear her sing again, my stomach is nowhere to be found, and my heart is punching itself in the face with one arm and hugging itself with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might never have this opportunity again, so I wrap my arm over her and begin playing. I close my eyes and search for the beat of her heart, which has slowed down some since the first song. The vibration of her voice meets my cheek, and I swear my heart flinches. She feels the way I imagined a voice would feel during a song but multiplied by a thousand. I focus on how her voice blends with the vibration of the guitar, and I’m in complete awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to “hear” the range of her voice, but it’s hard without using my hands to feel it. I pull my hand away from the guitar and stop playing. Just like that, she stops singing. I shake my head no and motion a circle in the air with my finger, wanting her to keep singing even though I’m no longer playing the chords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice picks back up, and I keep my ear pressed firmly to her chest while I lay my palm flat against her stomach. Her muscles clench beneath my hand, but she doesn’t stop singing. I can feel her voice everywhere. I can feel it in my head, in my chest, against my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relax against her and listen to the sound of a voice for the very first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arm around Maggie’s waist and pull her in closer. I can feel her struggling beneath me, so I pull her even tighter. I’m not ready for her to go home yet. Her hand smacks my forehead, and she’s lifting me off her chest as she attempts to wiggle out from beneath me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll onto my back to let her off the bed, but instead, she’s slapping my cheeks. I open my eyes and look up to see Sydney hovering over me. Her mouth is moving, but my vision is too fogged over to see what she’s trying to say. Not to mention that the strobe light isn’t helping. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/maybe-someday/page-14.html","bookId":2711,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
