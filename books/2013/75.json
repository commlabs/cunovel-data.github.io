Kechra guard his flanks. He is the charging crest of a river of blood, and he shall flood these lands. And even as the Letherii drown in it, so shall we.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You cheated the death night, Kraysos, and so you still fear dying.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Masarch’s other side, Theven snorted. ‘The bledden herb had lost most of its potency. It took neither of us through the night. I screamed to the earth, Masarch. I screamed and screamed. So did Kraysos. We do not fear what is to come.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hadralt was killed by his own warriors,’ Masarch said. ‘From behind. This does not bode well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are wrong,’ Theven said. ‘Redmask’s words have turned them all. I did not think such a thing would be possible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I suspect we will be saying that often,’ noted Kraysos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We should walk down, now,’ said Masarch. ‘We are his first warriors, and behind us now there are tens of thousands.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheven sighed. ‘The world has changed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will live a while longer, you mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young warrior glanced across at Masarch. ‘That is for Redmask to decide.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar rode at the Atri’Preda’s side as the troop made its way down the trader track, still half a day from Drene’s gates. The soldiers at their backs were silent, stoking anger and dreams of vengeance, no doubt. There had been elements of Bluerose cavalry stationed in Drene since shortly after the annexation of Bluerose itself. As far as Brohl Handar understood, the acquisition of Bluerose had not been as bloodless as Drene had been. A complicated religion had served to unite disaffected elements of the population, led by a mysterious priesthood the Letherii had been unable to entirely exterminate. Reputedly some rebel groups still existed, active mostly in the mountains lining the western side of the territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the old Letherii policy of transferring Bluerose units to distant parts of the empire continued under Edur rule, certainly suggesting that risks remained. Brohl Handar wondered how the newly appointed Edur overseer in Bluerose was managing, and he reminded himself to initiate contact with his counterpart-stability in Bluerose was essential, for any disruption of Drene’s principal supply route and trading partner could prove disastrous if the situation here in the Awl’dan ignited into full-out war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You seem thoughtful, Overseer,’ Bivatt said after a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Logistics,’ he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If by that you mean military, such needs are my responsibility, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your army’s needs cannot be met in isolation, Atri-Preda. If this conflict escalates, as I believe it will, then even the Factor cannot ensure that shortages will not occur, particularly among non-combatants in Drene and surrounding communities.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In all-out war, Overseer, the requirements of the military always take precedence. Besides, there is no reason to anticipate shortages. The Letherii are well versed in these matters. Our entire system of transport was honed by the exigencies of expansion. We possess the roads, the necessary sea lanes and merchant vessels.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There nonetheless remains a chokepoint,’ Brohl Handar pointed out. ‘The Bluerose Mountains.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot him a startled glance. ‘The primary eastward trade goods through that range are slaves and some luxury foodstuffs from the far south. Bluerose of course is renowned for its mineral wealth, producing a quality of iron that rivals Letherii steel. Tin, copper, lead, lime and fire-rock, as well as cedar and spruce-all in abundance, while the Bluerose Sea abounds with cod. In return, Drene’s vast farms annually produce a surplus harvest of grains. Overseer, you appear to have been misinformed with respect to the materiel demands in question. There will be no shortages-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps you are right.’ He paused, then continued, ‘Atri-Preda, it is my understanding that the Factor has instituted extensive trafficking of low-grade weapons and armour across the Bluerose Mountains. These weapons are in turn sold to the Awl, in exchange for land or at least the end of dispute over land. Over four hundred broad-bed wagonloads have been shipped thus far. Although the factor holds the tithe seal, no formal acknowledgement nor taxation of these items has taken place. From this, I can only assume that a good many other supplies are moving to and fro across those mountains, none with official approval.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Overseer, regardless of the Factor’s smuggling operations, the Bluerose Mountains are in no way a chokepoint when it comes to necessary supplies.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-75.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
