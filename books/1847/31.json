I have a lot of work to do. I’ve fallen way behind fooling around with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both on our feet by that time, having a good old-fashioned Mexican standoff. I didn’t have a damn thing to say and neither did he. We just stared at each other until he finally broke the silence. “I’m not giving up on this relationship, Zoe. That’s the bottom line. If I have to camp outside in your secretary’s office with a sleeping bag and a box of Twinkies, so be it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t hold the laugh in. “Oh, so now I’m a joke, Zoe?” I laughed harder until the tears starting rolling down my cheeks and I was holding my stomach. The fact of the matter was what he said was hilarious, but the situation wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regained my composure because he was truly getting pissed. “Quinton, I’ll call you. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my ass on the edge of my desk. “Tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why tomorrow? Why can’t I see you this evening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I really do have a lot of work backed up on me, and tonight Jason and I are having some friends over for dinner.” The workload was true, but the dinner was a lie. I had something else in mind for that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, fine. I’ll leave, but I better hear from you tomorrow, Zoe, or else!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or else what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or else I’ll come back, throw your ass over my shoulder, and carry you out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both giggled at that one. “You’ll hear from me. I promise.” I don’t know why I forgave his ass. I guess it’s hard to blame someone for going astray when you’re married your damn self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s seal that promise with a kiss, and then I’ll believe you.” We started kissing, and one kinky thing led to another. Five minutes later, I pushed the speak button on the intercom and told my secretary to take an early lunch. Then Quinton fucked me on top of my desk, and we devoured each other for lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I left work that evening, after calling Jason and telling him I had to meet one of my distributors to talk business, I made a beeline for Tyson’s apartment. I was feenin’ for his ass big-time. I simply loved the way he was rough with me that first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had just gotten home from the auto garage where he worked as a mechanic when I got there. He was covered with motor oil and grease and looked sexy as all hell to me. I was taking things to the extreme, having fucked Quinton on my desk earlier that day and now getting ready to fuck someone else before driving home to my husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyson was happy to see me and told me to hop in the shower with him. I stripped down to nothing and did justthat. He made me prop my leg up on the edge of the tub so he could eat my pussy, and then I sucked his dick before he held me up against the wall with my legs straddled around his waist and fucked me rough just like I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got out the shower, and I told him what had been on my mind that whole day and the reason I was really there. “Tyson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to try something real freaky!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened; he gawked at me and said, “Word? Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dunno,” I replied because I really didn’t have a well-thought-out answer. “I was just going to leave it up to you. You seem like a man who knows how to turn a sistah out the right way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, yeah, if that’s what you want.” He paced around the bed naked while I propped myself up on a pillow so I could admire the view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he said, “Look, if you’re really down for this, I have an idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to let all my inhibitions go and threw caution to the wind. “Cool! I’m down for whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy, why the hell did I say that? Less than five minutes Tyson had me tied to his bed butt-naked on my stomach with a blindfold on. I was just ass out and had no choice but to be down for whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lubricated my rear like a Corvette and then took it literally. Much to my surprise, the way he did it was painless. I realize now it was all in my head, and because I didn’t have time to let fear build up, I took it in the ass without all the psychotic fears going on. He took his time with me, and when it was all in, he worked me just like he did with vaginal sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyson came, and we were lying there with his soft dick still inside me when there was a loud knocking at the door. “Tyson, open this damn door! You fuckin’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebastard!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” I turned my head toward the door but couldn’t see for jack because of the blindfold. “Who is that woman banging on your door?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he whispered was, “Shhhhhhhhhh, she’ll go away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Untie me right now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe covered up my mouth with my hand, and I was pissed. “Just be quiet, Zoe. I’m not answering the door. That ho’s crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tyson, I know your ass is in there with some bitch! Open the damn door, now!” He stayed on top of me, his dick in my ass, trying to prevent me from squirming. “You ain’t nuttin’ but a lying, cheating, male tramp! Just wait till your ass comes out that bitch! I got something for that ass!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she left—at least, we thought she did. He got off me, removed the blindfold, and untied me. I hurriedly got dressed. I didn’t need yet another lover that was fucking someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zoe, she’s my ex. I’vebeenfinished with her skank ass.” I didn’t need another lame explanation either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever!” I got fully dressed and started looking for my keys. “She’s not my problem, Tyson! She’s yours!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong again! She was my problem. He walked me outside and came to find out the heifer had cut all my tires and scratched the wordBITCHon the side panel of my car with her keys. She was long gone, and good thing she was, because I would’ve been going down the river for homicide that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople sitting out on their stoops were having a goodlaugh, saying, “Oh shit!” “Damn, must be some good dick!” and “That’s what your ass gets for fucking around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into Tyson’s place to call the auto club. I couldn’t believe this shit was happening. How in the world was I going to cover my ass on this one? Like they say though, where there’s a will . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI instructed the tow truck driver to haul the car to my regular service garage near my house, all the way on the other side of town. He was pissed but had no choice, since that was one of the benefits of having the gold plus plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter telling Tyson to kiss my black ass, I hopped into the cab of the truck with the driver, cursing under my breath the whole way to the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to make it look good, so I called Jason from my cell phone when we were almost there and told him the car had been vandalized outside the restaurant downtown where I had met a distributor to discuss business. I told him to pick me up at the garage in ten minutes. The tow truck driver, an old countrified hick, was staring at me when I closed out the call. I gave him a glare and told him, “Mind your own fucking business!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason was already there when we pulled up at the garage, talking to our mechanic. The expression on his face when he saw the car, which had to be towed on a flatbed since all four tires were flat, was definitely one for the books. After asking me fifty questions, all to which I answered, “I have no idea. It just happened,” he decided he was just elated I wasn’t harmed in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, we made love more intensely than we ever had. He started out by coming in the bathroom while I was taking a bath, rolling up his sleeves, and washing my back. I almost fainted from that show of affection alone. Then he dried me off, carried me to bed, and gave memore time and attention than he ever had before. It still wasn’t great sex, but it was a sign that maybe there was hope for us yet. I didn’t ask him for oral sex and heaven knows anal sex was out the freakin’ question. I was just glad that, for once, he made me feel like he desired me as much as I did him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echapternineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of the way Jason made love to me the night of my brush-with-death experience (according to him), I decided to throw myself headfirst into my marriage. I had messed up big-time, but the bottom line was, I still loved my husband more than life itself, and he was the only man I ever truly wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI planned the ultimate romantic evening for that Friday. I asked my mother, who had already gone far and beyond her duties as a grandmother, to stay with the kids overnight so I could kidnap Jason and attempt to turn his ass out. She agreed to stay over, and I picked up Jason at his office. We were sharing the Land Rover, since the Mercedes was still in the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought I was picking him up just to go home and do the regular dinner with the kids, followed by watching a couple of sitcoms and the news-before-bed routine. When he saw I was headed in the opposite direction from our house, he demanded to know, “Where are we going?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/addicted/page-31.html","bookId":1847,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:39:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:39:27 PM"}
