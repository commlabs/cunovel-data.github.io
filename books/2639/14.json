Luther spilled his guts, and by the time he finished Riley Albritton was roaring with laughter. \"It\u0027s Luther,\" Riley said to someone in the background, probably Doris. \"Blair just called. She\u0027ll be home tonight.\" And with that, Doris or whoever it was broke into hysterics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther wished he hadn\u0027t called. \"Help me out here, Riley,\" he pleaded. \"Can you guys stop by?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, bud. We\u0027re going to the MacIlvaines for dinner. They invited us a bit earlier, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Luther said and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang immediately. It was Nora, her voice as edgy as Luther\u0027d ever heard it. \"Where are you?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m in the kitchen. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sitting in traffic on Broad, near the mall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you going to the mall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I couldn\u0027t park at the District, couldn\u0027t even get in off the street. I\u0027ve bought nothing. Do you have a tree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, a real beauty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you decorating it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have Perry Como crooning \u0027Jingle Bells\u0027 in the background while I\u0027m sipping eggnog and trimming our tree. Wish you were here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you called anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the Lairds and Albrittons, neither can make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve called the Pinkertons, Harts, Malones, and Burklands. They\u0027re all busy. Pete Hart laughed at me, the bore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll beat him up for you.\" Spike was knocking on the door. \"I gotta get busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you\u0027d better start calling the neighbors,\" she said, her hyper voice faltering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To invite them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in a million years, Nora. I\u0027m hanging up now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No word from Blair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s on an airplane, Nora. Call me later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpike\u0027s borrowed wagon was a red Radio Flyer that had seen its better years. With one look, Luther deemed it too small and too old, but they had no choice. \"I\u0027ll go over first,\" he explained, as if he knew exactly what he was doing. \"Wait five minutes, then bring the wagon over. Don\u0027t let anyone see you, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s my forty bucks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther handed him a twenty. \"Half now, half when the job is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the Trogdon home through the side door of the garage, and felt like a burglar for the first time in memory. When he opened the door to the house, an alarm beeped for a few seconds, very long seconds in which Luther\u0027s heart froze and his entire life and career flashed before him. Caught, arrested, convicted, his license revoked, banished by Wiley Beck, disgraced. Then it stopped, and he waited another few seconds before he could breathe. A panel by the rear door said things were Clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a mess. The house was a landfill with debris strewn everywhere, clear evidence of another successful visit by Ole St. Nick. Trish Trogdon would choke her husband if she knew he\u0027d given Luther the keys. In the living room, he stopped and stared at the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was well known on Hemlock that the Trogdons took little care in decorating their tree. They allowed their children to hang anything they could find. There were a million lights, strands of mismatched garlands, tacky ornaments by the boxload, red and green icicles, even strings of popcorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora will kill me, Luther thought, but he had no choice. The plan was so simple it had to work. He and Spike would remove the breakable ornaments, and the garlands, and for sure the popcorn, lay them all on the sofa and chairs, ease the tree out of the house with lights intact, haul it over to Luther\u0027s, and dress it with real decorations. Then, at some point in the near future, Luther and perhaps Spike would strip it again, haul it across the street, put the Trogdon junk back on it, and everybody would be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the first ornament and it shattered into a dozen pieces. Spike showed up. \"Don\u0027t break anything,\" Luther said, as he cleaned up the ornament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we getting in trouble for this?\" Spike asked. \"Of course not. Now get to work. And fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later the tree was stripped of anything breakable. Luther found a dirty towel in the laundry, and lying flat on his stomach, under the tree, he managed to work the metal tree stand onto the towel. Spike leaned in above him, gently shoving the tree to one side, then the other. On hands and knees, Luther managed to slide the tree toward Spike, across the wood floor, across the tile of the kitchen, down the narrow hall to the laundry, where the branches scraped the walls and dead spruce needles trailed behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making a mess,\" Spike said, helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll clean it later,\" said Luther, who was sweating like a sprinter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tree, of course, was wider than the door to the garage, as all trees are. Spike pulled the wagon close. Luther grabbed the trunk of the tree, lifted it with a strain, swung, the bottom through the door and pulled the whole thing through. When it was sitting safely in the garage, Luther caught his breath, hit the garage door opener, and managed a smile at Spike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so brown?\" the kid asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile vanished as Luther was reminded of the cruise he wouldn\u0027t be taking. He looked at his watch-twelve-forty. Twelve-forty and not a single guest for the party, no food, no Frosty, no lights strung anywhere, no tree, as yet, but one on the way. It seemed hopeless at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0027t quit, old boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther strained again and lifted the tree up. Spike shoved the wagon under, and of course the metal tree stand was wider than the Radio Flyer. Luther got it balanced, though, and watched it for a moment. \"You sit here,\" he said, pointing to a tiny spot in the wagon and under the tree. \"Keep it from tipping over. I\u0027ll push.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think this\u0027ll work?\" Spike said, with great suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street, Ned Becker had been minding his own business when he saw the tree disappear from the Trogdons\u0027 front window. Five minutes passed, and the tree reappeared in the open garage, where a man and a kid were wrestling with it. He looked harder, and recognized Luther Krank. Watching every move, he called Walt Scheel on a portable phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Walt, Ned here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas, Ned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas, Walt. Say, I\u0027m watching the Trogdons\u0027 house, and it appears as if Krank has lost his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s stealing their Christmas tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther and Spike began their way down the Trogdon driveway, which had a slight decline to the street. Luther was behind the wagon, hanging on, letting it roll slightly. Spike clutched the trunk of the tree, terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScheel peeked out his front door, and when he saw the theft with his own eyes, he punched the number for the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, this is Walt Scheel, Fourteen eighty-one Hemlock. There\u0027s a burglary under way, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here. At Fourteen eighty-three Hemlock. I\u0027m watching it in progress. Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrogdon\u0027s tree made it across Hemlock to the other side, right in front of the Becker house, where now in the front window Ned, his wife, Jude, and his mother-in-law were watching. Luther negotiated a right turn with the handle, and began pulling the wagon toward his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to sprint before anyone saw him, but Spike kept telling him to take it slow. Luther was afraid to look around, and he didn\u0027t believe for a second that he was going unnoticed. When he was almost to his driveway, Spike said, \"Cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther wheeled around just as the patrol car slowed to a stop in the middle of the street, lights flashing but no siren. Two officers jumped out as if it were a SWAT mission,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther recognized Salino with the large stomach, then young Treen with the thick neck. The same two who\u0027d stopped by hawking calendars for the Police Benevolent Association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Krank,\" Salino said with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you going with that?\" asked Treen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To my house,\" Luther said, pointing. He\u0027d come so close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027d better explain,\" said Salino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, Wes Trogdon over there let me borrow his Christmas tree. He left town an hour ago, and me and Spike here were just moving it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther turned and looked behind him, down at the wagon, at the narrow gap where Spike had been. Spike was gone, nowhere to be seen on Hemlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, a kid down the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalt Scheel had a seat on the fifty-yard line. Bev was resting, or trying to. His laughter got so loud that she came to see what was the matter. \"Pull up a chair, honey, they\u0027ve caught Krank stealing a tree.\" The Beckers were howling too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got a report that a burglary was in progress,\" said Treen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no burglary. Who called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Mr. Scheel. Whose wagon is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Spike\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you stole the wagon too,\" said Treen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve stolen nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to admit, Mr. Krank, it looks very suspicious, Salino said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, under normal circumstances, Luther might be forced to say that the entire scene was a bit unusual. But Blair was getting closer by the minute, and there was no time to back down. \"Not at all, sir. I borrow Trogdon\u0027s tree all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better take you in for questioning,\" Treen said, and unsnapped a pair of handcuffs from his belt. The sight of the silver cuffs sent Walt Scheel to the floor. The Beckers were having trouble breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Luther went weak at the knees. \"Come on, you can\u0027t be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in the backseat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther sat low in the back, thinking of suicide for the first time in his life. The two cops in the front seat were chatting on the radio, something about finding the owner of the stolen property. Their lights were still swirling, and Luther wanted to say so much. Let me go! I\u0027ll sue! Turn off the damned lights! Next year I\u0027ll buy ten calendars! Just go ahead and shoot me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Nora came home now, she\u0027d file for divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kirby twins were eight-year-old delinquents from the far end of Hemlock, and for some reason they happened by. They walked close to the car, close to the rear window, and made direct eye contact with Luther, who squirmed even lower. Then the Bellington brat joined them and all three peered in at Luther as if he\u0027d killed their mothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpike came running, followed by Vic Frohmeyer. The officers got out and had a word with him, then Treen shooed the kids away and released Luther from the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got keys,\" Vic was saying, and Luther then remembered that he did indeed have the keys to Trogdon\u0027s. What a moron!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know both these men,\" Frohmeyer continued. \"This is no burglary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cops whispered for a moment as Luther tried to ignore the stares from Vic and Spike. He glanced around, half-expecting to see Nora wheel into the drive and have a stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the tree?\" Salino asked Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he says Trogdon loaned it to him, then that\u0027s the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay, Salino said, still sneering at Luther as if he\u0027d never seen a guiltier criminal. They slowly got in the car and drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Luther said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you doing, Luther?\" Vic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m borrowing their tree. Spike\u0027s helping me move it. Let\u0027s go, Spike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout further interruption, Luther and Spike rolled the tree up the driveway, into the garage, and grappled with it until it was sitting rather nicely in the front window. Along the way they left a trail of dead needles, red and green icicles, and some popcorn. \"I\u0027ll vacuum later,\" Luther said. \"Let\u0027s check the lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. It was Nora, more panicked than before. \"I can\u0027t find a thing, Luther. No turkey, no ham, no chocolates, nothing. And I can\u0027t find a nice gift either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gifts? Why are you shopping for gifts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Christmas, Luther. Have you called the Yarbers and Friskis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he lied. \"Their lines were busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep calling, Luther, because no one is coming. I\u0027ve tried the McTeers, Morrises, and Warners, they\u0027re all busy. How\u0027s the tree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpike plugged in the lights and the tree came to life. They attacked the nine boxes of decorations without a care as to what went where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street, Walt Scheel watched them through binoculars. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skipping-christmas/page-14.html","bookId":2639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM"}
