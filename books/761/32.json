A grate Company of Guests assembled at Mt Vernon to celebrate Gen\u0027l Washington\u0027s Birthdaye. In the Morning the Gentlemenn went a Fox hunting, but their Sport was marred by the Pertinacity of some Motion Picture menn who persewd them to take Fillums and catchd the General falling off his Horse at a Ditch. In the Evening some of the Companye tooke Occasion to rally the General upon the old Fable of the Cherrye Tree, w\u0027ch hath ever been imputed an Evidence of hys exceeding Veracity, though to saye sooth I never did believe the legend my self. \"Well,\" sayes the General with a Twinkle, \"it wolde not be Politick to denye a Romance w\u0027ch is soe profitable to my Reputation, but to be Candid, Gentlemenn, I have no certain recollection of the Affaire. My Brother Lawrence was wont to say that the Tree or Shrubb in question was no Cherrye but a Bitter Persimmon; moreover he told me that I stoutly denyed any Attacke upon it; but being caught with the Goods (as Tully saith) I was soundly Flogged, and walked stiffly for three dayes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was glad to heare the Truth in this matter as I have never seen any Corroboration of this surpassing Virtue in George\u0027s private Life. The evening broke up in some Disorder as Col Fairfax and others hadd Drunk too freely of the Cock\u0027s Taile as they dub the new and very biting Toddy introduced by the military. Wee hadd to call a chirurgeon to lett Blood for some of the Guests before they coulde be gott to Bedd, whither they were conveyed on stretchers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3202/87480.html","bookId":761,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:00:31 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:00:31 AM"}
