She is the gay one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan shrugged. \"Travis justâ€¦he\u0027s always confused about women. You should go for him. He\u0027d enjoy your locaness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni smacked Juan again. \"Get out! Really?\" She smiled at the thought of being even a little alluring to Travis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah. Stop hitting me. I\u0027m driving.\" Juan pointed to the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\" Jenni was grinning hard now. \"Well, Katie is gay, so he has to know that isn\u0027t going to happen. So, maybe he\u0027ll look my way. I need makeup. And maybe a cute top.\" Jenni thought for a moment. \"Think we\u0027ll get to kill zombies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mind just goes all over the place, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan pulled into a nearly empty parking lot outside of what had probably been a very \"modern\" building in the Seventies, but could now be safely classified as an atrocity of architecture. Only two cars were in the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street was a nice park. There were no houses nearby, so it was easy to look around and see that the area was pretty clear of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just keep smart, Loca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni nodded and slid out of the truck. She flicked the safety off her rifle and walked slowly toward the main entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first obstacle to their expedition was in plain view once they got close enough. The library had a set of glass double doors with a small foyer between them. Trapped inside of them was an old man, dead, hungry, and beating on the interior door. It was kind of funny that he still clung to his library book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants in,\" Jenni observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possible survivors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan walked over and peered past the old man. \"Can\u0027t see anything but a card catalog up against the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Survivors then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. If they had food in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man became aware of them and turned. He hissed when he saw them and instantly started banging on the door to the outside. Surprisingly, it wasn\u0027t locked and slowly opened under his weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot it, Loca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni waited until the man managed to stagger outside and fired one shot, neatly taking off the top of his head and shattering the glass door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan looked down at the zombie\u0027s book. \"Better Sex After 60,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked. She broke into wild laughter. \"Oh, shit. That is funny. He probably got here early to turn it in before his buddies saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey became aware of three anxious faces looking at them over the top of the card catalog. They were drawn, a little pinched, but live faces. The heavy piece of library furniture was pushed out of the way and a woman unlocked the inner door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank God! Juan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belinda!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan hugged the woman tightly and slipped into the library. \"Everyone okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni sized up Belinda. She had long black hair, amber eyes, and a tiny frame. She was obviously Hispanic and very pretty. The other woman was older, blond, and very short and stout. The third person was a young teenage girl with red hair and a spray of freckles across her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God someone came for us,\" the blond woman exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gretchen, good to see you alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same here, Juan,\" the stout woman answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda locked the door behind them. \"We\u0027ve been here since it started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were almost out of food,\" the teenager said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re here now,\" Jenni said with a smile. She felt a little weird about Belinda, but liked feeling like the rescuer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord, we\u0027ve been eating snacks out of the vending machines. We\u0027re almost out,\" Gretchen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got locked in when Mr. Marsters showed up with a bad bite. He said someone bit him as he was stopped at a stoplight. We tried to help him, but he died,\" Belinda explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had heard about them coming back and we took no chances and were carrying him out when he did come back,\" Gretchen added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We almost didn\u0027t get away from him. He tripped and fell and that is when we managed to lock the door,\" Belinda finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni studied her a bit longer. She was fairly sure that librarians were not supposed to be attractive or sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan quickly explained about the fort, the situation, and all they had endured. Gretchen kept clasping her hands and saying, \"Dear sweet Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teenager just seemed dazed. Belinda kept hugging Juan, which really annoyed Jenni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni wasn\u0027t sure she liked any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there are no doctors or nurses in the fort?\" Gretchen asked in horror after Juan was done with his story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Clinic got wiped out right away. That\u0027s why we need books,\" Juan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda clasped her hands over her mouth and tears welled in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook it off and said, \"Okay. Give us the list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan rummaged around in the pocket of his worn jeans and pulled it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda took it and immediately scanned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, we\u0027ll divide it up, load up the book carts, and get out of here,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni tried not to frown at her. Who had put her in charge anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut being the good sport she was, Jenni trudged along behind Gretchen, pushing a book cart while it got loaded up with what looked like a bunch of really boring books. Juan went with Belinda and the teenager collected all the remaining candy from the vending machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni was almost disappointed when they got out to the truck and there were no zombies in sight. She was feeling edgy and irritable and wanted to shoot something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all squeezed into the truck. Belinda sat next to Juan with the teenager on her lap. Gretchen squeezed in next and Jenni ended up crammed in last, almost on top of Gretchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip back was even more boring than the trip out. Again she saw some zombies trapped in houses, beating on windows, but none broke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of Mikey, sighed, and felt even more like shooting stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the fort, the ladies were helped up over their defenses and into the construction site while Juan loaded up the old pallet Travis had built with the books while Jenni and others stood watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she went over the wall, Juan behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Loca, we\u0027re safe and sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big fucking deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan looked at her and frowned. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni just wrinkled her nose at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get to kill anything on the way back. At all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan started to laugh. \"Yeah, but you\u0027re back and okay. So you can go flirt with Travis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni considered this for a moment, but it didn\u0027t seem quite as alluring as before. \"Oh, yeah. I guess I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time to come out of the straight closet, chica.\" Juan mussed up her hair with one hand and strode off to join Belinda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni just scowled after him. She stomped her foot once and stormed off to pout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. The Terrible World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni walked out of the new gate cautiously, her rifle in her hands, safety off, ready to fire. Bill walked with her, also sweeping his gaze over the abandoned street. Curtis was right behind them, looking very nervous. This was his first time out of the fort and he was already sweating profusely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni had been asked to accompany the former cops on a search and rescue expedition. Either Juan had talked up her skills and craziness to grandiose proportions or her actions in the fort had made her seem crazy, yet competent. Or maybe it was a combination of both. But it did amuse her that they wanted her to tag along, because they knew she had no issue about killing the zombies. Unfortunately, there were those who did seem to have issues with killing their former townspeople. Already on one rescue mission, someone\u0027s aversion to killing their zombified grandmother had resulted in one death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction workers attempted to shut the gate behind them, but there were a lot of teeth jarring screeches and a lot of swearing. Juan had told Jenni that there had been some issues with the gate and obviously this was true. Hopefully, they would have it fixed by the time they got back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her efforts to not be annoyed, Jenni was having trouble dealing with Juan. It was all about Belinda and she hated it bothered her so much. It became clear that Juan\u0027s real reason for the library excursion was to hopefully save Belinda. And since she was one of the town\u0027s librarians, everyone knew her, which annoyed Jenni to no end. Since Belinda had arrived, they dynamics had changed again. Juan was constantly acting like a total idiot around Belinda, trying to act all smooth and sophisticated and if Jenni even tried to pop a joke in his direction, he\u0027d get annoyed. Though she was utterly loath to admit it, she missed their banter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strode quickly toward the mini-bus they had begun to use during the rescue missions. The fort population was slowly growing and the number of men and women was slowly evening out. There were at least a dozen children now and Peggy\u0027s son had plenty of other kids to play with. At times Jenni felt annoyed with their presence. It was hard to see other children alive and well when hers had died so quickly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-47.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
