{"id":71878,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eBigman\u0027s blaster was ready. He might have shot unerringly, but a blaster would not have left much behind. Dead men tell no tales and dead enemies explain no mysteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pursued with catlike patience, cutting down the distance between them, following the light, trying to estimate the nature of the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blaster always ready, Bigman moved to make first contact. First, radio! His fingers set the controls quickly for general local transmission. The enemy might have no equipment to receive that on the wave lengths Bigman could deliver. Unlikely, but possible! Very unlikely and barely possible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it didn\u0027t matter. There was always the alternative of a light blaster bolt against the wall. It would make his point clearly enough. A blaster carried authority and had a plain way of speaking that was understood in any language anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, his tenor voice carrying all the force it could muster, \"Stop, you! Stop where you are and don\u0027t turn around! There\u0027s a blaster beaded in on you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman flashed on his suit-light, and in its glare the enemy froze. Nor did he make any effort to turn around, which was proof enough for Bigman that he had received the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Now turn around. Slowly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure turned. Bigman kept his right hand in the path of his suit-light. Its metal sheath was clamped tightly about the large-caliber blaster. In the glow of the light, its outline was comfortingly clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"This blaster is fully charged. I\u0027ve killed men with it before, and I\u0027m a dead shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy obviously had radio. He was obviously receiving, for he glanced at the blaster and made a motion as though to raise a hand to block off the blaster\u0027s force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman studied what he could see of the enemy\u0027s suit. It looked quite conventional (did the Sirians use such familiar models?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said curtly, \"Are you keyed in for radio transmission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was sudden sound in his ears and he jumped. The voice was a familiar one, even under the disguising distortion of the radio; it said, \"It\u0027s Peewee, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever in his life had Bigman needed greater self-control to keep from using his blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was, the weapon leaped convulsively in his hand and the figure facing him leaned quickly to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Urteil!\" yelled Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis surprise turned to disappointment. No Sirian! Only Urteil!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the sharp thought: What was Urteil doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil said, \"It\u0027s Urteil all right. So put away the bean-shooter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That gets put away when I feel like it,\" said Big-man. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mines of Mercury are not your private property, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While I have the blaster they are, you fat-faced cobber.\" Bigman was thinking hard and, to a certain extent, futilely. What was there to do with this poisonous skunk? To take him back to the Dome would reveal the fact that Lucky was no longer in the mines. Bigman could tell them that Lucky had lingered behind, but then they would become either suspicious or concerned when Lucky failed to report. And of what crime could he accuse Urteil? The mines were free to all, at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, he could not remain indefinitely pointing a blaster at the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Lucky were here, he would know-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as though a telephathic spark had crossed the vacuum between the two men, Urteil suddenly said, \"And where\u0027s Starr, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" said Bigman, \"is nothing you have to worry about.\" Then, with sudden conviction, \"You were following us, weren\u0027t you?\" and he shoved his blaster forward a little as though encouraging the other to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the glare of Bigman\u0027s suit-light, the other\u0027s glassite-hidden face turned downward slightly as though to follow the blaster. He said, \"What if I were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain there was the impasse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"You were going along a side passage. You were going to swing in behind us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said... What if I were?\" Urteil\u0027s voice had almost a lazy quality about it, as though its owner were thoroughly relaxed, as though he enjoyed having a blaster pointed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil went on. \"But where\u0027s your friend? Near here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know where he is. No need for you to worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I insist on worrying. Call him. Your radio is on local transmission or I wouldn\u0027t hear you so well... Do you mind if I turn on my fluid jet? I\u0027m thirsty.\" His hand moved slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" said Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman watched tensely. He did not expect a weapon to be activated by chest control, but the suitlight could be suddenly raised to blinding intensity, or-or... Well, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Urteil\u0027s fingers finished their motion while Bigman stood irresolute, and there was only the sound of swallowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scare you?\" asked Urteil calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman could find nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil\u0027s voice grew sharp. \"Well, call the man. Call Starr!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the impact of the order, Bigman\u0027s hand began a movement and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil laughed. \"You almost adjusted radio controls, didn\u0027t you? You needed distance tranmission. He\u0027s nowhere near here, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No such thing,\" cried Bigman hotly. He was burning with mortification. The large and poisonous Urteil was clever. There he stood, the target of a blaster, yet winning the battle, proving himself master of the situation, while with every passing second Bigman\u0027s own position, in which he could neither shoot nor lower his blaster, leave nor stay, grew more untenable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWildly the thought gnawed at him: Why not shoot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he knew he could not. He would be able to advance no reason. And even if he could, the violent death of Senator Swenson\u0027s man would make tremendous trouble for the Council of Science. And for Lucky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only Lucky were here...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePartly because he wished that so ardently, his heart leaped as Urteil\u0027s light lifted slightly and focused beyond him, and he heard Urteil say, \"No, I\u0027m wrong after all and you\u0027re right. Here he comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman whirled. \"Lucky... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his right mind, Bigman would have waited calmly enough for Lucky to reach them, for Lucky\u0027s arm to be on his shoulder, but Bigman was not quite in his right mind. His position was impossible, his deske for a way out overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had time only for that one cry of \"Lucky\" before going down under the impact of a body fully twice as massive as his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few moments he retained the grip on his blaster, but another arm was tearing at his hand, strong fingers were wrenching and twisting his. Bigman\u0027s breath was knocked out of him, his brain was whirling with the suddenness of the attack, and his blaster went flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight lifted from him, and when he turned to struggle to his feet Urteil was towering over him and Bigman was staring into the muzzle of his own blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have one of my own,\" said Urteil, grimly, \"but I think I\u0027d rather use yours. Don\u0027t move. Stay that way. On hands and knees. That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever in his life had Bigman so hated himself. To be tricked and hoodwinked this way. He almost deserved death. He would almost rather die than ever have to face Lucky and say, \"He looked behind me and said you were coming so I turned... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said in a strangled voice, \"Shoot, if you have the nerve for it. Shoot, and Lucky will track you down and see to it that you spend the rest of your life chained to the smallest, coldest asteroid ever used as a prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky will do that? Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will because you\u0027ll tell me where he is. And tell me, too, why he came down to the mines in the first place. What\u0027s he doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To find Sirians. You heard him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To find comet gas,\" growled Urteil. \"That senile fool, Peverale, may talk Sirians, but your friend never believed any of it. Not even if he only has the brains you do. He came down for another reason. You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To save your miserable life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not enough reason for me,\" said Bigman, and he rose to his feet and took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil moved backward till he was leaning against the wall of the tunnel. \"One more motion and I\u0027ll blast you with pleasure. I don\u0027t need your information very badly. It will save time, but not much. If I spend more than five minutes with you, it\u0027s a waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now let me tell you exactly what I think. Maybe it will teach you that you and your tin hero, Starr, are fooling nobody. Neither one of you is good for anything more than tricks with force-knives against an unarmed man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman thought gloomily: That\u0027s what\u0027s griping the cobber. I made him look like a jackass in front of the boys, and he\u0027s waiting for me to crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re going to do all that talking,\" he said, squeezing as much contempt into his voice as he could manage, \"you might as well shoot. I\u0027d rather be blasted than talked to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t race for it, little fellow, don\u0027t race for it. In the first place, Senator Swenson is breaking the Council of Science. You\u0027re just an item, a tiny one. Your friend Starr is just another item, and not a much bigger one. I\u0027m the one who\u0027s going to do the breaking. We\u0027ve got the Council where we want it. The people of Earth know it\u0027s riddled with corruption, that its officers waste the taxpayers\u0027 money and line their own pockets- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a filthy lie,\" broke in Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll let the people decide that. Once we puncture the phony propaganda the Council puts out, we\u0027ll see what the people think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You try that. Go ahead and try!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We intend to. We\u0027ll succeed too. And this will be exhibit number one: you two in the mines. I know why you\u0027re here. The Sirians! Huh! Starr either put Peverale up to telling the story, or he just took advantage of it. I\u0027ll tell you what you two are doing down here. You\u0027re faking the Sirians. You\u0027re setting up a Sirian camp to show people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I chased them off singlehanded,\u0027 Starr will say. \u0027I, Lucky Starr, big hero.\u0027 The sub-etherics make a big deal out of it and the Council calls off its Project Light on the sly. They\u0027ve milked it for all it\u0027s worth, and they\u0027re getting out with their skins__ Except that they won\u0027t be because I\u0027ll catch Starr in the act and he\u0027ll be so much mud under shoe and so will the Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman was sick with fury. He longed to tear at the other with his bare hands, but somehow he managed to hold himself in leash. He knew why Urteil was talking as he was. It was because he man didn\u0027t know as much as he pretended. He was trying to get more out of Bigman by making him blind-mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low voice, Bigman tried to turn the tables. \"You know, you putrid cobber, if anyone ever punctured you and let out the comet gas, your peanut-sized soul would show itself clear. Once they let the rot out of you, you\u0027d collapse to nothing but a loose sack of dirty skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil shouted, \"That\u0027s enough... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Bigman shouted over him, his high-pitched voice ringing. \"Shoot, you yellow pirate. You showed yellow at the dinner table. Stand up to me, man to man, with bare fists and you\u0027ll show yellow again, bloated as you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman was tense now. Let Urteil act in rash haste now. Let Urteil aim on impulse and Bigman would jump. Death was probable, but there would be a chance...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Urteil seemed only to stiffen and grow colder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t talk, I\u0027ll kill you. And nothing will happen to me. I\u0027ll claim self-defense and make it stick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with Lucky, you won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll have his own troubles. When I\u0027m through with him, his opinions won\u0027t mean a thing.\" The blaster in Urteil\u0027s hand was steady. \"Are you going to try to run for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From you?\" Bigman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s up to you,\" said Urteil coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman waited, waited without saying a word while Urteil\u0027s arm grew stiff and Urteil\u0027s headpiece dropped slightly as though he were taking aim, though at point-blank range he could not miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman counted the moments, trying to choose the one in which to make his desperate jump for life as Lucky had when Mindes had similarity aimed at him. But here there was no second party to tackle Urteil as Bigman had tackled Mindes on that occasion. And Urteil was no panicky, mind-sick Mindes. He would laugh and aim again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman\u0027s muscles tensed for that final jump. He did not expect to live for more than five more seconds, perhaps. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-big-sun-of-mercury-lucky-starr-4/page-9.html","bookId":1757,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM"}
