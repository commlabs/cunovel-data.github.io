We form synchronized partnerships naturally,and although they are hardly noticeable to some,they are quite tangible to others.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We have always relied on emotional contact and signalsfrom our parents, peers, teachers and friends toguide us through our lives. We are influenced by theiremotional feedback, their gestures and their way ofdoing things. When your mother or father sat a certainway, you would do the same; if a cool friend or a moviestar walks a certain way, you might adopt a similar gait.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We learn by aligning ourselves with the signals otherpeople send us. They impress their way of being on us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We synchronize what we like about them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e People with common interests have natural rapport.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The reason you get along so well with your close friendsis that you have similar interests, similar opinions andmaybe even similar ways of doing things. Sure, you willoften find plenty to differ on and argue about, but essentiallyyou are very much like each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We human beings are social animals. We live in com29munities. It\u0027s far more \"normal\" and even logical for peopleto get along with one another than it is for them toargue, fight and not get along. The irony is that societyhas conditioned us to be afraid of each other—to set upboundaries between ourselves and others. We live in asociety that pretends to find its unity through love butin actuality finds it through fear. The media scare us halfto death with headlines and advertisements continuallytelling us of earthquakes and airplane crashes and askingus if we have enough insurance, are we too fat, toothin, does the smoke detector work and what aboutthose high funeral expenses? Natural rapport is a primerequirement for our sanity, our evolution and, indeed,our survival.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28310.html","bookId":253,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:54:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:54:48 AM"}
