Fixed smiles locked on their faces, they glance at each other before Christie, unsure, shrugs and quietly answers, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabrina smiles, takes this as a cue and agrees. \"No, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the two of them for a minute before recrossing my legs and sighing, very irritated: \"Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce \u0026amp; Pierce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard of it?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother long pause. Finally Sabrina breaks the silence. \"Is it connected with Mays... or Macy\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause before asking, \"Mays?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks about it for a minute then says, \"Yeah. A shoe outlet? Isn\u0027t P \u0026amp; P a shoe store?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristie stands up, surprising me, and moves over to admire the stereo. \"You have a really nice place here... Paul,\" and then, looking through the compact discs, hundreds upon hundreds of them, stacked and lined up in a large white-oak shelf, all of them alphabetically listed, \"How much did you pay for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing up to pour myself another glass of the Acacia. \"Actually, none of your business, Christie, but I can assure you it certainly wasn\u0027t cheap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the kitchen I notice Sabrina has taken a pack of cigarettes out of her handbag and I walk back into the living room, shaking my head before she can light one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no smoking,\" I tell her. \"Not in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles, pauses slightly and with a little nod slips the cigarette back into its box. I\u0027m carrying a tray of chocolates with me and I offer one to Christie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Varda truffle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares blankly at the plate then politely shakes her head. I move over to Sabrina, who smiles and takes one, and then, concerned, I notice her wineglass, which is still full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to get drunk,\" I tell her. \"But that\u0027s a very fine chardonnay you\u0027re not drinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place the tray of trues on the glass-top Palazzetti coffee table and sit back in the armchair, motioning for Christie to get back on the couch, which she does. We sit here silently, listening to the Les Miserables CD. Sabrina chews on the truffle thoughtfully and takes another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to break the silence again myself. \"So have either of you been abroad?\" It hits me almost immediately what the sentence sounds like, how it could be misinterpreted. \"I mean to Europe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them are looking at each other as if some secret signal is passing between them, before Sabrina shakes her head and then Christie follows with the same head movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next question I ask, after another long silence, is, \"Did either of you go to college, and if so, where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response to this question consists of a barely contained glare from each of them, and so I decide to take this as an opportunity to lead them into the bedroom, where I make Sabrina dance a little before taking off her clothes in front of Christie and me while every halogen bulb in the bedroom burns. I have her put on a Christian Dior lace and charmeuse teddy and then I take off all my clothes - except for a pair of Nike all-sport sneakers - and Christie eventually takes off the Ralph Lauren robe and is buck naked except for an Angela Cummings silk and latex scarf, which I knot carefully around her neck, and suede gloves by Gloria Jose from Bergdorf Goodman that I bought on sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the three of us are on the futon. Christie is on all fours facing the headboard, her ass raised high in the air, and I\u0027m straddling her back as if I was riding a dog or something, but backward, my knees resting on the mattress, my dick half hard, and I\u0027m facing Sabrina, who is staring into Christie\u0027s spread-open ass with a determined expression. Her smile seems tortured and she\u0027s wetting her own lips by fingering herself and tracing her glistening index finger across them, like she\u0027s applying lip gloss. With both my hands I keep Christie\u0027s ass and cunt spread open and I urge Sabrina to move in closer and sniff them. Sabrina is now face level at Christie\u0027s ass and cunt, both of which I\u0027m fingering lightly. I motion for Sabrina to move her face in even closer until she can smell my fingers which I push into her mouth and which she sucks on hungrily. With my other hand I keep massaging Christie\u0027s tight, wet pu**y, which hangs heavy, soaked below her spread, dilated ass**le.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smell it,\" I tell Sabrina and she moves in closer until she\u0027s two inches, an inch, away from Christie\u0027s ass**le. My dick is standing straight up now and I keep jerking myself off to keep it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lick her cunt first,\" I tell Sabrina and with her own fingers she spreads it open and starts lapping at it like a dog while massaging the clit and then she moves up to Christie\u0027s ass**le which she laps at in the same way. Christie\u0027s moans are urgent and uncontrolled and she starts pushing her ass harder into Sabrina\u0027s face, onto Sabrina\u0027s tongue, which Sabrina pushes slowly in and out of Christie\u0027s ass**le. While she does this I watch, transfixed, and start rubbing Christie\u0027s clit quickly until she\u0027s humping onto Sabrina\u0027s face and shouts \"I\u0027m coming\" and while pulling on her own ni**les has a long, sustained orgasm. And though she could be faking it I like the way it looks so I don\u0027t slap her or anything. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-73.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
