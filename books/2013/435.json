But, since you abjure all aspects of humour, anything I might consider and then observe with the word “funny” is obviously something you would not understand.’ Tehol then leaned slightly forward. ‘But wait, that’s just it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What nonsense are you-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s why I am, after all, much smarter than you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad smiled. ‘Indeed. Please, do explain yourself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why, without a sense of humour, you are blind to so much in this world. To human nature. To the absurdity of so much that we say and do. Consider this, a most poignant example: a mob approaches, seeking my head because I stole all their money, and what do you do to appease them? Why, throw them all the money you’ve stolen from them! And yet, it’s clear that you were completely unaware of just how hilarious that really is-you made your decision unmindful of what, eighty per cent of its delicious nuances. Ninety per cent! Ninety-three per cent! And a half or just shy of a half, but more than a third but less than… oh, somewhere close to a half, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad waggled a finger. ‘Incorrect, I’m afraid. It is not that I was unmindful. It is that I was indifferent to such nuances, as you call them. They are, in fact, entirely meaningless.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, you may have a point there, since you seem capable of being appreciative of your own brilliance despite your ignorance. But let’s see, perhaps I can come up with another example.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are wasting your time, Tehol Beddict. And mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am? It didn’t seem you were very busy. What is so occupying you, Invigilator? Apart from anarchy in the streets, economic collapse, invading armies, dead agents and burning horses, 1 mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was involuntary, as Karos Invictad’s eyes flicked down to the puzzle box. He corrected himself-but too late, for he saw a dawning realization in Tehol’s bruised face, and the man leaned yet farther forward in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s this, then? Some magic receptacle? In which will be found all the solutions to this troubled world? Must be, to so demand all of your formidable genius. Wait, is something moving in there?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The puzzle is nothing,’ Karos Invictad said, waving one bejewelled hand. ‘We were speaking of your failings.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol Beddict leaned back, grimacing. ‘Oh, my failings. Was that the topic of this sizzling discourse? I’m afraid I got confused.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Some puzzles have no solution,’ Karos said, and he could hear how his own voice had grown higher-pitched. He forced himself to draw a deep breath, then said in a lower tone, ‘Someone sought to confound me. Suggesting that a solution was possible. But I see now that no solution was ever possible. The fool did not play fair, and I so dislike such creatures and could I find him or her I would make an immediate arrest, and this entire building would echo with the fool’s screams and shrieks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros paused when he saw Tehol frowning at him. ‘What is it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nothing. Funny, though.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Invigilator reached for his sceptre and lifted it from the desktop, pleased as ever with the solid weight of the symbol, how it felt in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Okay, not funny. Sorry I said anything. Don’t hit me with that thing again. Please. Although,’ Tehol added, ‘considering it’s the symbol of your office, hitting me with it, while somewhat heavy-handed, is nevertheless somewhat… funny.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am thinking of giving you over to the citizens of Letheras,’ Karos said, glancing up to gauge how the man would react to that statement. And was surprised to see the fool smiling again. ‘You think I jest?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never. Obviously.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you would enjoy being torn apart by the mob?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I doubt it. But then, I wouldn’t be, would I? Torn apart, I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, and why not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because, not only do I have more money than you, Invigilator, I am-unlike you-entirely indifferent regarding who ends up owning it. Hand me over, by all means, sir. And watch me buy my life.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad stared at the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol wagged a broken finger. ‘People with no sense or appreciation of humour, Invigilator, always take money too seriously. Its possession, anyway. Which is why they spend all their time stacking coins, counting this and that, gazing lovingly over their hoards and so on. They’re compensating for the abject penury everywhere else in their lives. Nice rings, by the way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros forced himself to remain calm in the face of such overt insults. ‘I said I was thinking of handing you over. Alas, you have just given me reason not to. So, you assure your own Drowning come the morrow. Satisfied?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-435.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
