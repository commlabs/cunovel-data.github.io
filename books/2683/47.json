Conrad?\" Pause. \"Conrad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad continues to stare at Fitz, and as I\u0027m leaving he says, \"Has anybody realized that our drummer is the most lucid person in this band?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking up Lafayette unable to shake off the feeling of being followed and stopping on the corner of East Fourth I catch my reflection superimposed in the glass covering of an Armani Exchange ad and it\u0027s merging with the sepia-toned photo of a male model until both of us are melded together and it\u0027s hard to turn away but except for the sound of my beeper going off the city suddenly goes quiet, the dry air crackling not with static but with something else, something less. Cabs lumber by silently, someone dressed exactly like me crosses the street, three beautiful girls pass by, each maybe sixteen and eyeing me, trailed by a thug with a camcorder, the muted, dissonant strains of Moby float from the open doors of the Crunch gym across the street where on the building above it a giant billboard advertises in huge black block letters the word TEMPURA. But someone\u0027s calling \"Cut!\" and the noise from the construction site of the new Gap behind me and the beeper going off-for some freaky reason it\u0027s the number of Indochine-moves me toward a phone booth where before dialing I imagine a naked Lauren Hynde striding toward me in a suite at the Delano with a deeper sense of purpose than I can muster. Alison picks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to make a reservation,\" I say, trying to disguise my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got something I want to tell you,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I gulp. \"Y-you used to be a man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison knocks the phone on a hard surface. \"Oh sorry, that\u0027s my call-waiting.
