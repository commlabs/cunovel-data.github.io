Transfixed, she stared at her own name, written in the scholarly script Mother Ambrose had made her practice and perfect. The abbey! Suddenly, she could not, would not, believe God was actually letting this happen to her. Surely, during her long years at Belkirk abbey, God must have noticed her piety and obedience and devotion… well, at least her attempt to be obedient, pious, and devoted. \"Please God…\" she repeated wildly, over and over again. \"Don\u0027t let this happen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen—\" Stefan Westmoreland\u0027s bold voice slashed through the hall, echoing off the stone walls. \"A toast to the duke of Claymore and his new bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis new bride … the words reverberated dizzily in Jenny\u0027s brain, jarring her from her recollections of the past weeks. She looked around in a dazed panic, not certain whether her reverie had lasted seconds or minutes, and then she began to pray again:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please God, don\u0027t let this happen to me…\" she cried in her heart one last time, but it was too late. Her widened eyes were riveted on the great oaken doors that opened into the hall to admit the priest for whom everyone was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friar Benedict,\" her father loudly proclaimed as he stood at the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s breath stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has sent us word he is unwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart began to hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the wedding cannot be performed until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny tried to step back, away from the table, but the room was suddenly beginning to spin, and she couldn\u0027t move. She was going to faint, she realized with horror. And the person nearest to her was Royce Westmoreland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Aunt Elinor let out a cry of dismay as she recognized Jenny\u0027s plight, and she rushed forward, shamelessly jostling startled clansmen aside with her elbows. An instant later, Jenny found herself wrapped in a fierce hug, a parchment cheek pressed to hers, an achingly familiar voice bubbling in her ear. \"Now, now, babe, take a deep breath, and you\u0027ll feel right as can be in a moment,\" the voice crooned. \"Your Aunt Elinor is here now, and I\u0027ll take you upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world tilted crazily, then suddenly righted itself. Joy and relief poured through Jenny as her father addressed the company in the hall:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Twill only be a day\u0027s delay,\" he boomed, his back turned to the English. \"Friar Benedict is only mildly afflicted, and the good man promises to leave his pallet and come here on the morrow to perform the ceremony, no matter how ill he may still be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny turned to leave the hall with her aunt, and she stole a quick glance at her \"betrothed\" to see his reaction to the delay. But the Black Wolf seemed not to know she was there. His narrowed gaze was trained on her father, and though his expression was as inscrutable as a sphinx, there was a cold, speculative look in his eyes. Outside, the storm that had been threatening all day suddenly whipped itself into a frenzy, and lightning split the sky, followed by the first ominous, primitive boom of thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However,\" her father continued, turning to address the entire hall without ever actually looking at the English on his right, \"the feasting will take place as planned this eve. \u0027Tis my understanding from the emissary of King Henry that most of you wished to return to England at once on the morrow; however, I fear you may have to remain an extra day, since our roads aren\u0027t fit for English travel when the storms come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA babble of voices burst out on both sides of the room. Ignoring the stares aimed at her, Jenny walked with her aunt through the crowded hall, straight to the stairs that led up two stories to her bedchamber. To sanity and solace. To a reprieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the heavy oaken door of her bedchamber closed behind her, Jenny turned into Aunt Elinor\u0027s arms and wept unashamedly with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, there now, my kitten,\" said her mother\u0027s elderly aunt, patting Jenny\u0027s back with her small hand, and talking in the eager, disjointed, determined way that was so much a part of her, \"There\u0027s no doubt in my mind that when I didn\u0027t arrive yesterday or the day before, you gave up and thought I wasn\u0027t coming to be with you. \u0027Tis true, is it not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing back her tears, Jenny leaned back slightly in her aunt\u0027s fond embrace and nodded sheepishly. Ever since her father had suggested Aunt Elinor accompany Jenny to England, Jenny had been concentrating on that as the only joy on her gloomy, frightening horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCupping Jennifer\u0027s tear-streaked face in her palms, Aunt Elinor went on with bright determination. \"But I am here now, and I\u0027ve talked with your father this morn. I\u0027m here and I\u0027ll be with you every day from now on. Won\u0027t that be nice? We\u0027ll have lovely times together. Even though you\u0027ll needs be married to that Englishman and reside with him, beast that he is, we\u0027ll forget him altogether and go about the way we used to do, before your father banished me to the dower house at Glencarin. Not that I blame him, for I do chatter so, but I fear it\u0027s worse now than ever, for I\u0027ve been deprived so long of loved ones who I can talk with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked at her, a little dazed from her aunt\u0027s long, breathless speech. Smiling, she wrapped the small lady in a tight hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated at the long table on the dais, oblivious to the din of three hundred people dining and drinking around and below her, Jenny stared fixedly across the hall. Beside her, their elbows nearly touching, sat the man to whom the betrothal contract had bound her as irrevocably as the formal wedding ceremony which would follow tomorrow. For the last two hours that she\u0027d been forced to sit beside him, she\u0027d felt his icy gaze on her only thrice. It was as if he couldn\u0027t stand the sight of her and was only waiting to get her in his clutches so that he could begin making her life a hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA future of verbal attacks and physical beatings loomed before her, for even among the Scots it was not uncommon for a husband to beat his wife if he felt she was in need of discipline or encouragement. Knowing that, and knowing the temper and reputation of the angry, cold man beside her, Jenny was certain her life would be filled with misery. The tightness in her throat that had nearly choked her all day almost cut off her breath now, and she tried valiantly to think of something to look forward to in the life she\u0027d be forced to lead. Aunt Elinor would be with her, she reminded herself. And someday—someday soon, considering her knowledge of her husband\u0027s lustful nature—she\u0027d have children to love and care for. Children. She closed her eyes briefly and drew a painful breath, feeling the tightness slowly lessen. A baby to hold and cuddle would be something to look forward to. She\u0027d cling to that thought, she decided. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-60.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM"}
