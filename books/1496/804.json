It’s \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e family!” As she glared at him angrily, her flush deepened. Despite how muddled her thoughts were, she still felt humiliation and anger rising up inside of her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, she was currently pinned by Bai Xiaochun, and was very displeased at being touched in such a way. Second of all, she was coming to the realization that something strange was going on. Her thinking was too clouded. Furthermore, if she focused on an issue, it seemed that she would instantly make a decision about it and stick obstinately to that decision no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How could this be happening? It’s not that complicated of a situation. How come I didn’t get what was going on…?” Mistress Red-Dust was really starting to feel suspicious. In all her years of cultivation, she had never experienced anything like this before. All of a sudden, she thought back to the technique her father the giant ghost king had encouraged her to cultivate. However, merely thinking about the technique suddenly caused her thoughts to grow murkier, and her heart to feel more obstinate….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It was definitely father….” she thought, gritting her teeth. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Bai Xiaochun looked into her phoenix-like eyes, and suddenly felt his heart seize as surely as if a tiny hand had grabbed it. He swallowed hard, thinking about how Mistress Red-Dust’s body wasn’t bad at all. Furthermore, the way her cheeks flushed when she was angry made her even more attractive than usual.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMistress Red-Dust was fundamentally beautiful, and to see her confused and out of sorts only enhanced that beauty. All of a sudden, his heart began to race.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was something different about Mistress Red-Dust. Hou Xiaomei tended to glare, and Song Junwan was soft on the outside but filled with dangerous thorns. But Mistress Red-Dust was like a beautiful serpent that you just wanted to reach out and touch to see what would happen….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“She’s more of a vixen than Junwan!” he thought, gasping slightly. He immediately tried to get himself under control, but it was difficult considering that he was laying on top of her. Furthermore, although she wasn’t struggling as fiercely as she had been before, she was still moving here and there in a way that caused his heartrate to increase by the moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Ai, what powerful demon magic! Well, whatever. I, Bai Xiaochun, cannot let the Miao Clan patriarch outdo me in being willing to sacrifice. I guess I just need to put this demoness in her place!” Heart bursting with righteous intentions, he placed his right hand… onto her chest, just below her collarbone… and pushed down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Time to get put into place, demoness!” he shouted righteously. The fact that Bai Xiaochun was pushing his hand down onto her chest at first caused Mistress Red-Dust’s jaw to drop. Then she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Get your hands off me!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“So, the demoness dares to fight back!” he said grimly. “Good! Excellent! Just watch and see how I put you in your place!” For the sake of righteousness, he then placed his other hand onto her chest and pushed down….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a death wish, Bai Hao?!?!” she yelled, her rage burning to incomprehensible heights.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe corpse troopers stood around them, no expressions on their faces whatsoever as they watched the struggling man and woman whom they had surrounded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a charming scene that, if any random passerby happened to glance at without understanding the circumstances, would seem like….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the charming scene didn’t last for very long. Perhaps it was because Mistress Red-Dust was being upset in a way that she never had been before, or perhaps it was some other reason. In either case, the sealing which had been placed onto her suddenly shattered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen her cultivation base erupted with power, Bai Xiaochun immediately leaped away from her and backed up. As for Mistress Red-Dust, her eyes shone with cold light as she lunged forward to try to grab him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThunderous booming sounds filled the air, as well as a screaming wind. Bai Xiaochun shrieked as he fled, and Mistress Red-Dust chased him, her hair flying around crazily, and her face covered with a murderous look.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m gonna kill you, Bai Hao!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Men, stop this demoness!” Immediately, the previously stiff-faced corpse troopers leaped to intercept Mistress Red-Dust, their murderous auras seething.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMistress Red-Dust’s rage seemed to have increased her battle prowess quite a bit, and she managed to send quite a few corpse troopers flying out of her way. However, the silver-armored trooper was still a match for her, and before long, it was to her frustration and anger that she realized she couldn\u0027t get past him. Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun was encircled by a ring of corpse trooper bodyguards, who were escorting him further and further away from her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy this point, Bai Xiaochun was blushing a bit, and realized that, considering the level of his own willpower, he shouldn’t have acted like that just now. Apparently, Mistress Red-Dust’s demon magic was just too powerful. Unwilling to admit that openly, though, he said, “What are you doing, Zimo? I was trying to help you! Um… it’s obvious that you were ensorcelled by some demon magic! I was just trying to get rid of it!” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” Mistress Red-Dust retorted furiously. She was so angry she couldn’t even come up with words to speak. She simply hovered in the air, staring at Bai Xiaochun behind his protective ranks of corpse troopers, and gnashed her teeth angrily.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a bit guilty, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat. Flustered, he began to babble a bit. “Um… look, this was just a misunderstanding. What were we just talking about? Oh, right. You said that it wasn’t \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e family it was \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e family…. Zimo, you’re being to standoffish. Come on. Your family, my family. It\u0027s the same thing!” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMistress Red-Dust glared at him coldly, but was aware that she had instigated the situation. Furthermore, it was just as Bai Xiaochun said: the Proclamation of Universal Grace did take the Giant Ghost King into consideration. However, when she thought of the humiliation which had just occurred, she couldn’t suppress her fury.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJust as she was about to begin shouting again, her expression flickered, and she looked up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s pupils constricted as he did the same. Up above, the air was distorting, and soon, a dark, shadowy figure stepped out of thin air.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a black cloak that covered even his face. From the perspective of Bai Xiaochun and Mistress Red-Dust, he looked like little more than a black shadow!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis face was impossible to make out, and he was surrounded by inky darkness that seemed to be part of him, and him of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis man was none other than… the Grand Heavenmaster’s most trusted aide, the previous inspections commissioner, Hei Ming!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mistress Red-Dust realized it was Hei Ming, she was clearly taken aback. As for Bai Xiaochun, he took a deep breath as he realized that… the moment he had been waiting for had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo one could see Hei Ming’s expression. The only things anyone could see were his eyes, deep within the hood of his cloak. And yet, they didn’t contain even a hint of emotion. After studying the Inspections Manor for a moment, he ignored Mistress Red-Dust and focused on Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Give me the command medallion,” he said in the most sinister of voices, a voice which made the Inspections Manor seem to descend into the depths of winter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMistress Red-Dust’s expression flickered, and Bai Xiaochun stood there quietly for a moment. Although it was no surprise that the inspections commissioner medallion was being taken away from him, he was still very nervous. And yet, he was also confident in being able to make it through the coming trouble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePulling the medallion out, he looked down at it for a moment, then tossed it out in front of him. It immediately became a streak of violet light that shot toward Hei Ming.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHei Ming caught the command medallion and put it away. Then he spoke yet again in that sinister voice of his.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me, Bai Hao. The Grand Heavenmaster is awaiting an explanation!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he turned and flew up toward the imperial palace. Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and quickly reviewed the preparations he had made for this moment. Then, he flew up after Hei Ming.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMistress Red-Dust watched all of this happen, and although she was still angry with Bai Xiaochun, she also felt hesitation in her heart. After they left, she pulled out a transmission jade slip.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere were quite a few messages from the giant ghost king in the jade slip, but Mistress Red-Dust wasn’t in the mood to check any of them. Instead, she sent an urgent message.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Father, Hei Ming took away Bai Hao’s inspections commissioner medallion. Then he led him away….”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBack in Giant Ghost City, the Giant Ghost King was sitting there anxiously. According to his original plan, he was supposed to have brainwashed Mistress Red-Dust a bit after she came out of secluded meditation. Instead, she had headed toward Bai Xiaochun with murderous intentions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had sent her several urgent messages, but she was completely focused on her own desires, and had ignored him. The Giant Ghost King was left with no other option than to smile wryly and sigh. But then, he got a message back, and after he saw it, his eyes began to shine brightly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Hao is not the type of person who makes decisions rashly…. I wonder what secret weapon he has up his sleeve?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-801\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-803\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-802","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
