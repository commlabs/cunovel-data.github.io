She dreamed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout stars brighter than she\u0027d ever seen and starclouds shimmering in colors like the northern lights. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edreamed about sending an astronomical telegram to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to register her claim for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ediscovering a new supernova. About being the firstto see it with her wonderful new eyes, eyes thatshe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaw in a mirror-were all pupil, like an owl\u0027s or a cat\u0027s....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the dream changed and she was an owl, swooping down in a dizzying rush from a hollow Douglas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efir. She seized a squirrel in her talons andfelt a surge of simple joy. Killing felt so natural. All she had to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo was be the best owl she could be, and grab food with her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then a shadow fell over her from somewhereabove. And in the dream she felt a terrible sick real\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eization-that even hunters could be hunted. And that something was after her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke up disoriented-not as towhere shewas, but as to who she was. Mary-Lynnette or a hunter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeing chased by something with white teeth in themoonlight? And even when she went downstairs, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t shake off the sick feeling from her dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Mark said. \"Is that breakfast or lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both,\" Mary-Lynnette said, sitting down on the family room couch with her two granola bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark was watching her. \"So,\" he said, \"have you been thinking about it, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette tore the wrapper off a granola bar with her teeth. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Youknow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette did know.

She ought to be sick to her stomach at just the thought of killing, of drinking blood from a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewarm body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she was scared.

She stood up abruptly. \"If we\u0027re going over there, we\u0027d better get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoving,\" she said. \"It\u0027s almost one o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sisters and Ash were waiting at Burdock Farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Mark can sit in the front with me,\" MaryLynnette told Jade, not looking at Ash. \"But I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t think you\u0027d better bring the cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cat goes,\" Jade said firmly, getting in. \"OrI don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette put the car in gear and pulled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they came in sight of the small duster of buildings on Main Street, Mark said, \"And there it is,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edowntown Briar Creek in all its glory.

Then she got out and looked casually across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd Akers was there with his father, the sheriff and Vic Kimble was there with his father.

And I\u0027m sure you\u0027reright-humans can have names likeours,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoo. Sometimes it gets confusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some bizarre reason Mary-Lynnette\u0027s mind wasstill on wood. \"You know, I don\u0027t see why you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ename yourselves after trees. I thought wood was dangerous for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is-,and that makes it powerful. Tree names are supposed to be some of the most powerful\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enameswe have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was coming out of the general store. Immediately Mary-Lynnette turned around and looked for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t see him in the empty gas station, butshe heard something-something she realized she\u0027dbeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehearing for several minutes. Hammering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, let\u0027s go around back,\" she said, alreadywalking, not waiting for Ash to reach them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestreland Rowan went with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy was around back. He was hammering a long board across a broken window. There wereshards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof thick, greenish-tinted glass all over the ground. Light brown hair wasfalling in his eyes ashe struggled to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehold the board steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" What happened?\" Mary-Lynnettesaid. She moved automatically to hold the right end of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboard in place for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up at her, making a grimace of reliefas he let go of the board. \"Mary-Lynnette-thanks. Hang\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon a sec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached into his pocket for nails and began driving them in with quick, sure blows of the hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"I don\u0027t know what happened.Somebody broke it last night. Made a real mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night seems to have been a busy night,\" Kestrel said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy glanced back at the voice. And then ... his hands went still, poised with the hammer and nail. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas looking at Kestrel, and at Rowan beside her,looking a long time. At last he turned to MaryLynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand said slowly, \"You need more gas already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-no. No.\" I should have siphoned some out,Mary-Lynnette thought. Nancy Drew would defi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enitely have thought of that. \"I justit\u0027s been knocking a lotthe engine-and I thought you could lookat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit-under the hood-since you didn\u0027t last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncoherent and pathetic, she decided in the silencethat followed. And Jeremy\u0027s dear brown eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill searching her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Mary-Lynnette,\" he said-not sarcastically, but gently. \"As soon as I get finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, hecan\u0027t be a vampire. And so what am I doing here, lying to him, suspecting him, when he\u0027s only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eever been nice to me? He\u0027s the type to help old ladies, not kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSssssss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started as the feral hiss tore through the silence. It came from behind her, and for one horrible instant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe thought it was Kestrel. Then she saw thatJade and Mark had rounded the comer, and that Tiggy was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efighting like a baby leopard in Jade\u0027s arms. The kitten was spitting and clawing, black fur standing on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jade could get a better grip, he climbed up her shoulder and leaped, hitting the ground running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Tiggy! \"Jade shrieked. She took off after him, silvery blond hair flying, agile as a kitten herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkfollowed, ricocheting off Ash who was just comingaround the comer himself. Ash was knocked into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethegas station wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that was fun,\" Kestrel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mary-Lynnette wasn\u0027t really listening. Jeremywas staring at Ash-and his expression gave Mary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynnette coldchills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ash was staring back with eyes as green as glacier ice. Their gazes were locked in something like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einstantaneous, instinctive hatred. Mary-Lynnette felt a quiver of fear for Jeremy-but Jeremy didn\u0027t seem\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafraid for himself. His muscles were tight and he looked ready to defend himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, deliberately, he turned away. Turned hisback on Ash. He readjusted the board-and MaryLynnette did what she should have done in the beginning. She looked at his hand. The ring on his index\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinger glinted gold, and she could just make out the black design on the seal. A tall duster of bell-shaped flowers. Not an iris,not a dahlia, not a rose. No-there was only one flower\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan had mentioned that this could possiblybe. It grew wild around here and it was deadly poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoxglove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette felt hot and sick. Her hand began to tremble on the board she was holding. She didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to move, but she couldn\u0027t stay here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry-1 have to get something-\" The words came out in a painful gasp. She knew everyone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasstaring at her. She didn\u0027t care. She let go of the board and almost ran away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept going until she was behind the boardedup windows of the Gold Creek Hotel. Then she leaned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagainst the wall and stared at the place where town ended and the wilderness began. Motes of dust\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edanced in the sunlight, bright against a dark background of Douglas fir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m so stupid. All the signs were there, right in front of my face. Why didn\u0027t I seebefore? I guess because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary-Lynnette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette turned toward the soft voice. She resisted the impulse to throw herself into Rowan\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earms and bawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be okay in just a few minutes. Really. It\u0027s just a shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary-Lynnette ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just-it\u0027s just that I\u0027ve known him so long.It\u0027s not easy to picture himyou know. But I guess it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust goes to show you. People are never what they seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary-Lynnette-\" Rowan stopped and shook her head. \"Just what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Him.Jeremy. Of course.\" Mary-Lynnette took abreath. The air felt hot and chokingly dusty. \"He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit. He really did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?Because he\u0027s a werewolf. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause and Mary-Lynnette suddenly felt embarrassed. She looked around to make sure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody was in earshot, and then said more quietly,\"Isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan was looking at her curiously. \"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-you said black foxglove is for werewolves. And that\u0027s foxglove on his ring. How did you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just sensed it. Vampire powers are weaker insunlight, but Jeremy isn\u0027t trying to hide anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sure is,\" Mary-Lynnette said bitterly. \u0027 I should have sensed it. I mean ... he\u0027s the only person\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein town who was interested in the lunar eclipse. And the way he moves, and his eyes ... and he livesat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMad Dog Creek, for God\u0027s sake. I mean, that land\u0027s been in his family for generations.And\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Mary-Lynnette gave a sudden convulsive sniffle-\"people say they\u0027ve seen the Sasquatch around there. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebig hairy monster, half person and half beast. Now, what does that sound like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan was standing quietly, her expression grave-but her lips were twitching. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s vision\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblurred and wetness spilled onto her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" Rowan put a hand on her arm. \"I\u0027mnot laughing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was a nice guy,\" Mary-Lynnettesaid, turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still think he is,\" Rowan said. \"And actually,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally, you know, it means he didn\u0027tdo it.\" \"The fact that he\u0027s a nice guy?\" \"The fact that he\u0027s a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette turned back.\" What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see,\" Rowan said, \"werewolves are different. They\u0027re not like vampires. They can\u0027t drink a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle blood from people and then stop without doing anyreal harm. They kill every time they hunt-because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey have to eat.\"Mary-Lynnette gulped, but Rowanwent on serenely. \"Sometimes they eat the whole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanimal,but they always eat the internal organs, theheart and liver. They have to do it, the same way that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires need to drink blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that means ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t kill Aunt Opal. Or the goat. They wereboth intact.\" Rowan sighed. \"Look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerewolves and vampires traditionally hate each other. They\u0027ve been . rivals forever, and lamia think of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewerewolves as sort of-lower class. But actually a lot of them are gentle.They only hunt to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Mary-Lynnette said hollowly. Shouldn\u0027t shebe happier about this? \"So the guy I thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas nice just has to eat the odd liver occasionally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary-Lynnette, you can\u0027t blame him. How can I explain? It\u0027s like this: Werewolves aren\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople whosometimes turn into wolves. They\u0027re wolves who sometimes look like people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they still kill,\" Mary-Lynnette said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but onlyanimals.The law is very strict aboutthat. Otherwise humans catch on in no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVam pires can disguise their work by making it look like a cut throat, but werewolf kills are\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunmistakable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Great.\" I should be more enthusiastic, Mary-Lynnette thought. But how could you ever re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eally trust someone who was a wolf behind their eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might admire them the way you admire a sleek and handsome predator, but trust them ...no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before we go back-we may have a problem,\"Rowan said. \"If he realizes that you recognized his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ering, he may know we\u0027ve told you about you know.\" She glanced around and lowered her voice. \"The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette understood. \"Oh, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.
