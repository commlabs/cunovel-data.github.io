DANGER THREATENS BILL STURDY.","content":"It is my intention to pass rapidly over the time which intervened between the events which have been described, and the arrival of the Bouncing Betsey at Rio Janeiro. Nothing happened of sufficient interest to call for record.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for our hero and Bill Sturdy, their position was, unquestionably, more agreeable and less disturbed by incidents than before. This was not owing to any change in the feelings of the captain and mate, but in consequence of the iniquitous compact into which they had entered. They felt secure of ultimate vengeance; they could, therefore, afford to wait. Indeed, they felt that they should be more likely to secure the end they had in[238] view if, for the present, they should so act as to lull asleep any suspicions which might be entertained of their agency in the affair after it was over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Bill Sturdy was not deceived. He determined to keep his \"weather-eye open,\" as he expressed it, and be on the lookout for squalls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So the time passed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a bright, tropical day. The thick garments which all had worn on leaving port were laid aside, and every one was dressed in light and thin attire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We shall probably reach Rio to-morrow, Mr. Randall,\" observed the captain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; if the present wind holds, there can be no doubt of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And the little plan which we have been contemplating need no longer be delayed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Randall smiled acquiescence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The wind held favorable, and the next evening saw them in port.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The captain and mate went on shore, leaving the vessel in charge of the second mate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We have nothing to do with the motions of the captain, but will follow Randall, who, never backward in ill-doing, at once set about the execution of his scheme.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Having been in the city before, he was well[239] acquainted with localities, and therefore was able to direct his steps at once to that quarter where he felt he was most likely to meet the man he was in quest of.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He entered a low drinking-saloon, and ordered a glass of liquor, partly to gratify his taste, partly that while drinking he might have leisure to look about him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a low, square room, dark and unsightly, frequented evidently by the lowest ranks only. At this time there was but one man present besides Randall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This man was tall, low-browed, with shaggy black eyebrows, and a face on which villainy was stamped in Nature\u0027s plainest and most ineffaceable characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s a man,\" thought the mate, \"that will serve my turn, and, to judge from his looks, will be troubled by no unnecessary scruples on the subject.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile, the other, lifting his eyes from the glass, had observed his close scrutiny, and chose to take offence at it. He rose from his seat, and, advancing towards Randall, observed, in a menacing tone, \"It appears to me, se?or, that you are impertinent.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Randall understood the language in which this was spoken, and coolly inquired, \"How so?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [240]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have been staring at me as if you had some particular object in it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So I have,\" returned the mate, in the same tone as before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Explain yourself, se?or, and if, as I mistrust, you mean to insult me, I will make you better acquainted with my good knife,\" and he tapped the knife significantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is an acquaintance which I do not court,\" said Randall, shrugging his shoulders. \"But it appears to me that it is not well talking without something to moisten the throat. I shall be happy to have you drink with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I beg your pardon, se?or, for my suspicions, which, I see, were wrong. I see that you are a gentleman. Henceforth I will treat you as such.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I thought you would learn to know me better,\" said Randall, filling both glasses; \"let me drink to our better acquaintance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both sat down very amicably. The glass had made them friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should like to ask your advice on a certain point,\" said Randall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will give it with pleasure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have an enemy—a deadly foe—whom I detest. What would you do if you were in my place?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [241]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You say he is your deadly foe?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would give him a passport to another world. That is my advice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you would feel no compunctions?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No more than if I were crushing a spider.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will own, then,\" said Randall, \"that I have thought of this, but it is difficult for me to act in the matter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then hire another to do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, if I could only find some brave man who would undertake the job.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would engage him to do it for me, if——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If we could agree upon the terms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You need seek no further for your man, then,\" said the stranger, gulping down another glass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How is that?\" asked Randall, pretending not to understand him fully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because, you see before you one who is willing to undertake it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly, there is no good reason.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now tell me about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [242]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"First, let us settle about the price to be paid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As you please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After some little discussion this was finally fixed at sixty dollars. For this paltry sum, added to the booty which he might find upon the person of his victim, this miserable man was willing to commit one of the worst of crimes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" continued the mate, \"I must give you some directions which will enable you to identify the person.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is he a sailor?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"On board what ship?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Bouncing Betsey.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lying where?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Randall indicated the wharf at which the vessel was moored.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now describe the man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is rather below the common height, broad-shouldered, extraordinarily strong; in fact such a Hercules that it will be well for you to take him by surprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This will make me equal with him,\" said the Brazilian, displaying his knife.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That and the darkness.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When shall I be likely to meet him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He will receive permission to come on[243] shore to-morrow night,\" said Randall. \"You must be hovering about the vessel, and watch the sailors as they come from the ship. When you see him, you will follow him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Trust me for that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And when all is over, and you furnish me evidence that you have done the deed, the money shall be yours.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I require a portion in advance. How do I know but you will play me false?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My good friend, I should expect, in that case, to become your victim. However, your request is reasonable. You shall have one third of the sum stipulated in advance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He placed twenty dollars in the hands of his companion, and, rising, paid his score. He then betook himself to the ship, and, on the arrival of Captain Brace, acquainted him with the result of his visit. The latter expressed great satisfaction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile Bill Sturdy and Charlie were speaking of the plan they had in view,—that of escaping from the ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Suppose,\" said Charlie, \"we cannot obtain permission to go on shore together.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I will come to the wharf at midnight, and you can leave your bunk unobserved and join me.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1752/51220.html","bookId":1128,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:10:45 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:10:45 PM"}
