Even Bex went quiet at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later I felt the van veer and slow and, all around us, the world got dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the van\u0027s interior light, Bex looked at me. \"Tunnel?\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me and whispered back, \"Zach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could answer, the tunnel lights flickered, and we were lost in total darkness as the driver yanked the wheel. Tires screeched. I grabbed on to the seat, felt the swerve of the Baxters on either side of me, and yet no one screamed or braced for a crash as we careened fast -too fast- toward the tunnel wall. In the darkness I felt my best friend\u0027s hand reach out and grasp my own, as suddenly, that wall in front of us parted, and the painter\u0027s van was swallowed up whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun in my seat, and through the van\u0027s dusty rear windows I saw the hidden door close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool,\" Bex whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a light at the end of the tunnel (literally). Everything grew brighter while the van slowed and the passage grew wider until the space we were in was anything but a tunnel anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to Baring Cross Station,\" a high voice said as the van door slid open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, Bex\u0027s mother\u0027s arm was around my waist; her father\u0027s hand was gripping mine, and the best and brightest part of Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service were staring, watching me climb out of the van as if I were the most interesting thing in that cavernous space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling must have been five stories high. Catwalks sprawled above, and more vans sat to my right, parked at strange angles. All around us, people ran, shouting orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were stainless-steel staircases, polished chrome risers and frosted-glass partitions everywhere. I couldn\u0027t help but think that it had been almost exactly a year since I\u0027d been escorted into another super-cool, super-secret underground facility, beneath D.C. had been because of a boy. (Or . . . more specifically . . . a boyfriend.) In London, it was because of a man. (Or . . . more specifically . . . a teacher.) The year before, I\u0027d known the trip was coming. This time nothing about the day was in any way routine. Last winter, my mother had taken me to that facility to answer questions. But this time I stood beside the Baxters, consumed by the thing I didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" a woman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he hurt you?\" a man with surgical gloves and a white coat wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the bloody hell did he get so close?\" another man snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitor\u0027s Gate,\" one woman answered. \"He came in through Traitor\u0027s Gate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he did,\" the man mumbled, and I tried to shake the words from my head. They were gibberish. Nonsense. Because \"he\" was Mr. Solomon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\" was one of the best spies I\u0027ve ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\" was my father\u0027s best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked past a massive wall of screen, images of the city flashed by so quickly it was a miracle anyone could see a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Satellite is up!\" a young man in horn-rimmed glasses yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me eyes on every tube entrance, every intersection, every airport. We\u0027re close people!\" an older woman cried. \"Let\u0027s not let him get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex\u0027s eyes found mine, and I knew what she was thinking: our teacher wouldn\u0027t have walked onto that bridge if he hadn\u0027t had a way of getting off; he wouldn\u0027t have come to London if he hadn\u0027t had a way of getting out; and when Joe Solomon doesn\u0027t want to be found, there\u0027s not a camera, satellite, or operative on earth who can see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baxter! A voice called from the catwalk above us. \"You have the girl, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex\u0027s father placed his arm around my shoulder. \"She\u0027s here. She\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man gestured to a metal door at the end of the catwalk. \"Then come this way,\" he told me, but Bex stepped closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll be happy to wait in there,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent looked at Mrs. Baxter, whose face was just as determined as her daughter\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going with her,\" Mrs. Baxter said. \"Cammie is our responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you should have thought about that before you took her bloody ice skating,\" the agent snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to say something in protest - to remind them that it wasn\u0027t the Baxters\u0027 fault -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhatever \"it\" was. But Mrs. Baxter\u0027s hand was on my shoulder, gently pushing me forward, telling me that the path I was on now was one I had to walk alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROS AND CONS OF SPENDING THE NIGHT IN A TOP SECRET ROOM OF A TOP SECRET FACILITY, BUT NO ONE WILL TELL YOU WHY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(A list by Cameron Morgan)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Turns out, top secret underground government facilities are an excellent place to warm up after ice skating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: The warming-up process includes no friends, no family, and absolutely no answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Sometimes it\u0027s nice having a moment alone to compose yourself after fairly traumatic (and totally confusing) experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: The \"moment\" stops being nice when it goes on for almost two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Three words - Extra. Credit. Essay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: Two words - No. Bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Knowing there are fifty operatives and at least two hundred cameras between you and the people trying to get you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: Realizing, you know even less about those people then you thought you did. A lot less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery good operative knows there are several reasons to keep someone waiting before questioning them. Sometimes you want to make them nervous; sometimes you want to let them think; sometimes you need to gather the facts; and sometimes talking to them isn\u0027t that important. But there was only one reason that occurred to me when I heard the door creak open and pulled my head and arms off of the cold steel table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is my mother here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed, and I turned to watch a man I\u0027d never seen before walk to the other side of the room. He was tall with black wavy hair and deep blue eyes, and as he spoke in his rich British accent, both the spy in me and the girl in me became instantly aware of the fact that I was drooling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, Cammie?\" he asked, but barely waited to hear my \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything you need? Water? Something to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened on the bridge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man chuckled softly. \"Well, that\u0027s what I was hoping you could tell me.\" He dropped a file onto the table between us and moved to the chair opposite me, but there was something about the gesture - the sound of his laugh - that felt strange to me. Nothing seemed that funny anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t hurt you?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Solomon is my teacher. He would never hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure we can\u0027t get you something? Some hot cocoa, maybe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want cocoa. I want to know why a six-person grab team just surrounded Joe Solomon. I want to know why one of the CIA\u0027s best operatives had to break me out of M16\u0027s protection to talk to me. I mean, we are on the same side, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the man\u0027s smile disappeared - faded in a flash. \"Oh, we know who our friends are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Because it seems -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened on the bridge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Joe Solomon say on the bridge?\" he gritted his teeth as he reworded his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It all happened so fast. I didn\u0027t really understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he laughed, and this time mumbled, \"Of course you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" I asked, but he didn\u0027t answer. \"You\u0027re MI6, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impressive,\" he said, but something in his tone told me he wasn\u0027t impressed at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you? Where are the Baxters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted in his seat and leaned forward. \"Thanks to the Baxters, half of London saw what happened today, which, in our business, is a bad thing. So the Baxters are a little tied up at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what was worse, that Bex\u0027s parents were in trouble because of me, or that the man across from me was talking to me like I was an outsider - a fraud. Sure, I am a sixteen-year-old girl-slash-operative-in-training get me wrong, the sixteen-year-old -girl part has come in seriously handy on occasion, but he was giving me the kind of look I\u0027ve come to expect from people who didn\u0027t know the truth about my school - and the man across from me was supposed to know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I thought he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um . . . just out of curiosity,\" I said, \"what level clearance do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What level of clearance do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man smirked, then said, \"High enough.\" Which wasn\u0027t really an answer, but I didn\u0027t think this was the time to say so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is everyone looking for Mr. Solomon?\" I asked. When the man leaned back in his chair, I leaned closer and searched his blue eyes. \"There\u0027s been some kind of mistake,\" I told him. \"Call the Gallagher Academy. Call my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Joe Solomon tell you on the bridge?\" the man snapped, but I barely heard the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother is Rachel Morgan, operative ID 145-23-6741. Headmistress of the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women. You have to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who your mother is,\" he stated calmly. \"Now tell me about Joe Solomon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the words wash over me, tried to find the center of my rage, of my fear, before I slowly whispered, \"The pigeons. Mr. Solomon told me to follow the pigeons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for him to laugh again, but this time he studied me. \"Does that mean anything to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a lesson you\u0027ve had? A cutout you\u0027ve used?\" he asked, then shook his head in frustration. \"A cutout is a go-between two spies might use to carry information between\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what a cutout is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the pigeons don\u0027t mean anything to you?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, thought back to the feeling of the cold wind on my face and the pressure of Mr. Solomon\u0027s hands on my arms, but it was his eyes that I saw most plainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened so quickly. He was scared. He wasn\u0027t himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s good reason for that,\" the man said without a hint of emotion. \"You don\u0027t know Joe Solomon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" I said flatly. \"There\u0027s been a mistake.
