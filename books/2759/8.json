{"id":84919,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e“I’ll bring you a beer,” Jacey tells me as she hands me a menu and eyes the wrapped gift that I set on the table next to me. “What will Brand want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A beer is fine,” I tell her as I look over the food selection. “Thanks, Sis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods as she leaves and I glance around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant is nice, although Madison doesn’t seem like the kind of person who would own a restaurant. At least she didn’t seem that way last night. Today, though, who knows? I think about it for a second, and vaguely remember Jacey telling me that Maddy inherited it from her parents. That would make more sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning slightly, I find her in my periphery. Her light blonde hair is easy to find. Whereas last night she was dressed like a runway model, today she’s wearing workout clothes—tiny tight shorts, a tiny shirt that leaves nothing to the imagination and tennis shoes. It’s strange as fuck. It’s like she’s done a complete about-face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo who is the real Madison? The sexy siren who wanted to go home with me last night or this tightly wound business owner?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she’s tightly wound during the day and a siren in the sack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems like something that I should make it my mission to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s sitting with her little group now: a gorgeous dark-haired woman and a muscular tattooed guy. She’s also purposely not looking at me, I can tell. Her shoulders are angled away from me and she’s laughing at everything her companions say, as if to show me what a good time she’s having.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no, I’m not egotistical for thinking that her behavior revolves around me. At this moment, her behavior is revolving around me. She’s as acutely aware of where I am in this room as I am of her. Every so often I can see her sneaking sideways glances at me. She’s probably wondering about the real me, just like I’m wondering about the real her. If she saw much of my episode last night, if it was bad, then she’s probably trying to figure me out right this minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I can’t remember what happened last night, there’s only one thing I can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProve to her that I’m not a pussy. Stare at her until she squirms in her seat, as she remembers exactly what we almost did last night, what she begged me to do. Show her that she doesn’t have the upper hand with me just because I can’t remember what I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning to myself, I switch seats so that I’m squarely facing her. And then I pointedly stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should prove entertaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flush hotly as I feel Gabriel’s stare burning into me from across the room. How in the name of all that is holy did I not notice that his last name was the same as Jacey’s when I looked at his driver’s license last night? That accident must’ve shaken me up even more than I realized. And why the hell is he staring at me? He’s acting like nothing happened last night at all, like he didn’t totally lose his shit. What am I supposed to do with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he’s very obviously trying to draw my attention, there’s no way in hell that I’m going to acknowledge it. I’d rather die before I give him the satisfaction of looking at him. Instead I concentrate even more on appearing like I’m having one hell of a good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my wineglass and take another sip, before I smile broadly at my brother-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, how do you like working for your grandpa? How often are you going to have to go to Hartford this summer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax pauses mid-bite and thinks about my question. As he does, he absently rubs my sister’s back with his free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At first I wondered what the hell I’d gotten myself into. There was no way I wanted to be surrounded by suits and ties every day. But then I settled in and found my place. I don’t have to wear a suit and tie because I own the fucking company. I’m still proving myself to my grandpa, but I think I’m gonna like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” I answer. “But I’m not going to like it when you guys move away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila rolls her eyes. “Mad, we’ve been through this a hundred times. It’s a two-hour plane ride. You can come see me and I’ll come see you. It’s not like we’re never going to see each other again. And hopefully you’ll be dating someone soon, so that will distract you. We’ve gotta figure out something to do with your personal life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow. “Oh, we do, huh? You’re going to have input on that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila laughs and pats Pax’s leg. “I’m good at relationships, apparently. I can help you with yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have a relationship,” I remind her. “That was your whole point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. We’re going to start with an easy one. Ethan Eldridge. I know for a fact that he’s single. I bumped into his mom at the library the other day. She said he’s been lonely because a lot of his old friends have moved away. So there you go. You can start by dating Ethan. He’ll be good practice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold up a spoon. “And it doesn’t matter to you that this spoon has more of a personality than he does?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax bursts out laughing, looking over at Ethan before he glances at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She has a point. Madison needs someone who can give her a run for her money. That guy… er, he doesn’t seem quite up to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila gives her husband a skeptical look. “Maybe. But Maddy has always picked guys that are too overbearing, too controlling. And then it ends in a disaster and Maddy’s pissed off at the world and at the male species in general. Maybe she needs to try out a guy like Ethan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all glance discreetly in Ethan’s direction, to find him scrolling quietly through his cell phone. He’s wearing a preppy watch, a preppy shirt, perfectly fitted khakis. He’s so neat and tidy that even his nails are buffed and cut to a neat square. Very neutral, very bland and vanilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBland and vanilla just aren’t me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax turns back around, shaking his head. “I don’t think he’s got it in him to handle Maddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my eyebrows. “He can’t handle me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax quickly backtracks. “That’s not exactly what I meant. You’re… shall we say… a little fierce. You need a guy with balls. You don’t need a guy whose balls are in your purse. Just sayin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha, so says the guy whose balls are in Mila’s handbag as we speak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila laughs as I give Pax an icy stare. He ignores it and my comment, while he chews on a piece of bread, totally unaffected by my glare or my accusation that my sister owns his testicles. I guess he’s secure enough in his manhood to not care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning my head slightly, I can see Gabriel’s dark shape from the corner of my eye and I almost flush again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout this entire conversation, his smoldering stare has burned holes into me. It’s so potent that it almost feels like it’s actually touching me. Finally I’m unable to resist and I glance at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares back at me, his eyes stormy and dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is he thinking? Is he remembering the accident? Or is he remembering how scorchingly hot last night was before the accident? I stare at his mouth and I can’t help but remember how it tasted last night before his meltdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoky, minty… like a man. I gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I die. Because with his gaze still connected to mine, he very purposefully slips his finger into his mouth, then pulls it out slowly, sucking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like he sucked the taste of me off his fingers last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. My. God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks explode into flame and his dark, dark eyes glimmer with amusement. I stare at him as I realize that he’s fucking with me. He’s purposely trying to remind me of last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corner of his lip twitches and I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that he thinks he won whatever little game he’s been playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEff him. Willing the color to drain away from my face, I give Gabriel my iciest stare, lift my nose into the air and turn back around to find Mila watching the interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s that?” she asks with extreme interest. I shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacey’s brother. I just met him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila raises her eyebrow. “You just met him?” She stares at me. “That seems doubtful. You keep staring at each other. You know him. Spill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl at my sister. “Why do you have to know me so well? I met him last night at a club in Chicago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila chokes on her drink of water. “Seriously? You met him at a club?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd without any shame at all, she spins around in her seat to stare at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel stares back at her with interest, then cocks an eyebrow at me. He’s sprawled out in his seat, his long legs casually relaxed. None of this is affecting him in the same way it is affecting me. It’s like he doesn’t care that what happened last night was disconcerting as hell. That pisses me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn around,” I hiss at Mila, yanking on her arm. “God. Do you have to be so obvious?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help it,” she says, without turning around. “How can I not look at the guy who has you all worked up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not worked up,” I answer between my teeth, tugging on her arm harder. “Don’t make me manhandle a pregnant woman because then Pax will kill me. Just turn around. God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally does as I ask, but she looks at me strangely. “What the hell, Maddy? Why are you so upset? It’s just Jacey’s brother, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a knowingness to her tone that makes me want to smack my sister, even if she is pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I answer firmly, ignoring her tone and resisting my urge to inflict bodily harm. “He’s just Jacey’s brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, in that case, I should go introduce myself. I mean, Jacey is our employee. It’s only polite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, Mila is out of her seat and across the room before I can stop her. She moves surprisingly fast for a pregnant girl. I’m left staring with my mouth open. Pax reaches over and snaps it closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She got you, Mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him. “Pax, I swear to God. One of these days I’m going to kill her. It’s gonna happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax just laughs, entirely unconcerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever. If you were going to kill her, you would have done it a long time ago. But you didn’t. Instead you protected her like a mama bear. So I have a hard time believing that you would ever harm a hair on her head. And now I’ve gotta go take a piss. Can you behave yourself out here alone? And by that, I mean can you stay out here without killing anyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and follow him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not staying out here,” I mutter when he looks back at me in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you’re not coming with me,” he grins. “It’s big, but I can hold it myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me half a second to realize what he meant, and what it is. I feel myself blush in spite of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, I’m surrounded by imbeciles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes one more time for good measure, then stalk back to my office. I can hear my brother-in-law laughing as I go, just as I can feel Gabriel’s dark gaze tracking every move I make. It’s freaking unnerving and I’m pissed at myself that I let him get to me like this. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-leave-beautifully-broken-2/page-8.html","bookId":2759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM"}
