{"id":13469,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. DEAN FINDS A CLEW.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Dean was inclined to agree with his companion. The story told by his uncle was so preposterous that it could be explained only on the hypothesis that the speaker\u0027s mind was unbalanced. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you fall out of the wagon, neighbor Dunham?\" asked Mr. Gould.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. I must have fainted.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you had fallen out you would have been hurt. Are you bruised anywhere?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I don\u0027t feel hurt.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s queer, Dean,\" said Mr. Gould, with a puzzled look. \"I can\u0027t make it out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think the robber must have taken me out of the buggy, and set me down under the tree.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"After taking your thousand dollars?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, it is hard that I should lose it. I was countin\u0027 on what I would do with it. I thought I would pay off the mortgage on my house.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who holds the mortgage?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Squire Bates.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again Dean and Mr. Gould exchanged looks.47 Neither put any confidence in the story told by the victim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Adin Dunham was invited to take a seat in the buggy, Dean resigning his place and sitting behind. So they reached home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go in, Dean, and tell your aunt what has happened, so that she needn\u0027t be frightened when she sees your uncle,\" said Mr. Gould.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean obeyed instructions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aunt,\" said Dean, \"you are not to be frightened, but uncle met with an accident. He isn\u0027t hurt!\" he added, noticing the quick look of alarm, \"but he says he has been robbed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Robbed! Has he lost the thousand dollars?\" exclaimed Mrs. Dunham in a trembling voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did he really have a thousand dollars?\" said Dean. \"I thought he might be under a delusion.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then he says he has lost it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Heaven help us to bear this terrible blow!\" ejaculated Mrs. Dunham, sinking into a chair. \"I wish he had taken you with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish so, too. I don\u0027t believe one robber would have been a match for us both.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here Adin Dunham entered the house. He looked ten years older than when he left it in the morning, and there was a vacant look in the eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wife!\" he said feebly, \"it\u0027s all gone! Some villain has robbed me of the thousand dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you, Adin, were you hurt? You look sick.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 48\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My head doesn\u0027t feel right. I think it\u0027s the shock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll get you some hot tea directly. You\u0027ll feel better after taking it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope so. Oh, Sarah, I didn\u0027t expect such a blow as this.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Try not to think of it now. Get well first, and then we\u0027ll see what we can do to find the robber.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know him now!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know who robbed you!\" said his wife, stopping short in her surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who was it? Any one livin\u0027 round here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was Squire Bates.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A terrible suspicion entered the mind of the poor wife. It was clear to her that her husband\u0027s mind was unhinged. As soon as she had a chance she went out to where Dean and Mr. Gould were standing in the yard.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did Mr. Dunham tell you who robbed him?\" she asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, aunt,\" answered Dean. \"He said it was Squire Bates.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He just told me so. What do you think of it, neighbor Gould?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think your husband is upset by his accident,\" answered Gould, cautiously. \"We\u0027ll wait and see what he says to-morrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess you\u0027re right.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see he fainted away, and it\u0027s likely he hasn\u0027t49 fairly come to. At first I thought it wasn\u0027t true about the thousand dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is true. He received it to-day from the new hotel company for some land he sold them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s too bad, Mrs. Dunham. I\u0027ll do my part towards finding out the villain that robbed your poor husband.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Uncle says he knew the squire by his teeth,\" said Dean, thoughtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They certainly are very peculiar teeth.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you ever know anyone else having such teeth?\" asked Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, except the squire\u0027s boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Brandon\u0027s teeth are just like his father\u0027s. But of course the thief wasn\u0027t Brandon.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look here, Dean,\" said Mr. Gould quickly, \"I hope you don\u0027t pay any attention to that foolish story of your uncle. He was thinking of Squire Bates, as he intended to pay him up the mortgage which he holds, and he naturally pictured him with the teeth which are his most prominent feature, so to speak. I don\u0027t fancy the squire myself, but I think he is in better business than disguising himself and robbing his neighbors.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No doubt you are right, Mr. Gould,\" said Dean; but in spite of his words, and absurd as he admitted the suspicion to be, he could not help dwelling upon his uncle\u0027s story.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day Adin Dunham kept his bed. The shock to his system was such that his strength gave away, and the doctor was summoned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 50\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Adin,\" said his wife, anxious to clear up her doubts as to his sanity, \"can you describe the man that robbed you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why should I describe him? You know how he looks as well as I do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How should I know, Adin?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was Squire Bates, I tell you. You know how he looks.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The poor woman went out of the room, and raised her apron to her eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Poor Adin is clean upset!\" she murmured. \"It isn\u0027t enough that he\u0027s lost his money, he must lose his mind too. Misfortunes never come singly, as my poor old father used to say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean,\" she continued when they were alone, \"your uncle still sticks to his story that Squire Bates robbed him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aunt Sarah,\" answered Dean gravely, \"a thousand dollars would tempt almost anybody!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean, you don\u0027t mean to hint that the squire would rob anybody!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know, aunt. A good many strange things happen in the world.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I begin to think you are as crazy as your uncle!\" said Mrs. Dunham almost angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Suppose neither of us should be crazy, aunt!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Dunham shook her head. She was surprised that so sensible a boy as Dean should give credence to the absurd delusion of her husband.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile Dean had come to a conclusion as to what to do. He would visit the place where the51 robbery took place—his uncle had described it so accurately that there would be no mistaking it—and see whether there was anything to be learned there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He found an opportunity the very next afternoon. He did not say anything to his aunt, for it would only have excited her unduly. Besides, he thought it very possible that he would have to return without any information, and might be laughed at.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a considerable walk to the place indicated, but he reached it in due time. He was afraid he would meet some one who would ask him his object, but it was a lonely spot, and only one team passed. He saw it in time to dodge into the woods, and so avoided questioning.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the team had passed on he came out to the road. He could see the exact position of the buggy at the time it was stopped by the robber, and he found the tree under which his uncle was placed in an unconscious condition.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have satisfied my curiosity,\" he said to himself, \"but that is all. I haven\u0027t got any information.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then his sharp eyes fell upon a small bright object on the ground about three feet from the tree. He pounced upon it eagerly and picked it up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a sleeve button, apparently gold. Just in the center was a black initial letter. This letter was B!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean\u0027s eyes lighted up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This may lead to something,\" he said to himself quietly, as he slipped the button into his pocket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81473.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:27:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:27:35 AM"}
