I mean eleven-thirty at Metro CC?\" I yell back up. \"What happened to ten o\u0027clock at Cafe Tabac?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA longish pause. \"She now says nine-thirty at Bowery Bar. That\u0027s the end of it, Victor.\" Then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What horrible thing do you want me to do?\" JD pauses. \"Victor, would this photo-if published-screw up this guy\u0027s relationship with a certain young model named Chloe Byrnes and a certain volatile club owner of... oh, let\u0027s just say, hypothetically, this club, whose name is Damien Nutchs Ross?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that isn\u0027t the problem.\" I pull JD closer and, surprised, he winks and bats his eyes and I have to tell him, \"Don\u0027t get any ideas.\" I sigh, breathe in. \"The problem is that a photo exists. A certain cretinous gossip columnist is going to run this photo, and if we think Princess Cuddles having a heart attack is bad... that\u0027s nothing.\" I keep looking over my shoulder, finally telling everyone, \"We have to go downstairs to check the magician. Excuse us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about Matthew Broderick?\" Peyton asks. \"What about the salads?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can have two!\" I shout as I whisk JD down the long steep ramp of stairs heading into the basement, the light getting dimmer, both of us moving carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJD keeps babbling. \"You know I\u0027m here for you, Victor. You know I put the stud back in star-studded. You know I\u0027ve helped pack this party to the rafters with desirable celebs. You know I\u0027ll do anything, but I can\u0027t help you on this because of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"JD. Tomorrow in no particular order I\u0027ve got a photo shoot, a runway show, an MTV interview with `House of Style,\u0027 lunch with my father, band practice. I even have to pick up my f**king tux. I\u0027m booked. Plus this dump is opening. I-have-no-time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, as usual I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" JD maneuvers down the stairs hesitantly. \"Now about the magician-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck it. Why don\u0027t we just hire some clowns on stilts and bus in an elephant or two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does card tricks. He just did Brad Pitt\u0027s birthday at Jones in L.A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did?\" I ask, suspicious. \"Who was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ed Limato. Mike Ovitz. Julia Ormond. Madonna. Models. A lot of lawyers and `fun\u0027 people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gets even colder as we near the bottom of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean,\" JD continues, \"I think comparatively it\u0027s pretty in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But in is out,\" I explain, squinting to see where we\u0027re heading. It\u0027s so cold our breath steams, and when I touch the banister it feels like ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying, Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out is in. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In is... not in anymore?\" JD asks. \"Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him as we descend the next flight of stairs. \"No, in is out. Out is in. Simple, non?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJD blinks twice, shivering, both of us moving farther down into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, out is in, JD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, I\u0027m really nervous as it is,\" he says. \"Don\u0027t start with me today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t even have to think about it. Out is in. In is out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, okay. In is out? Do I have that down so far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom, it is so cold that I\u0027ve noticed candles don\u0027t even stay lit, they keep going out as we pass, and the TV monitors show only static. At the foot of the stairs by the bar, a magician who looks like a young German version of Antonio Banderas with a buzz cut idly shuffles a deck of cards, slump-shouldered, smoking a small joint, drinking a Diet Coke, wearing ripped jeans and a pocket T, the back-to-basics look, exaggeratedly sloppy, the rows of empty champagne glasses behind him reflecting what little light exists down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Out is in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then what exactly is in?\" JD asks, his breath steaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out is, JD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So... in is not in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the whole p-p-point.\" It\u0027s so cold my biceps are covered with goose bumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then what\u0027s out? It\u0027s always in? What about specifics?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you need this defined for you, maybe you\u0027re in the wrong world,\" I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magician gives us the peace sign in a vague way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did Brad Pitt\u0027s party?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magician makes a deck of cards, the stool he\u0027s sitting on, one of my slippers and a large bottle of Absolut Currant disappear, then says \"Abracadabra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did Brad Pitt\u0027s party?\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJD nudges me and points up. I notice the massive red swastika painted onto the domed ceiling above us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-6.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
