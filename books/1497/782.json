The other party had too many experts. If he were to charge forcefully with all his strength, he would naturally be able to leave. However, that was on the precondition that he used the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ and killed a bunch of people. Once he used the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’, Xiao Yan would feel extremely weak. If any other situation occurred during this period, he would no longer have much ability to defend himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you done over on your side?” Xiao Yan’s eyes swept in all direction as he quickly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Yes. Yes… Yes.” Medusa nodded indifferently. She did not waste too much strength in dealing with Yan Luo Tian. It was actually so smooth that it had exceeded her expectations. However, it was worthy of his Dou Zong strength to allow that fellow to die when he was having the most fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should leave first. I will take care of things behind. If we delay a little longer, it is likely that the experts from the Gold Geese Sect will charge over.” Medusa turned her head and spoke to Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan hesitated for a moment before nodding. He did not say any unnecessary words as his body moved and charged out of the encirclement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa’s sudden appearance undoubtedly caused the Mulan Valley experts’ faces to become much uglier. After nearly a year of exchanging blows, they were extremely clear of just how powerful the former was. In the past, the three Mulan Elders were able to fight with her a little with the help of the ‘Three Beast Savage Skill’. Now that one of the three was missing, the Qi Method had completely lost its effect. It was undoubtedly impossible for them to rely on their strength at the peak of the Dou Huang class to exchange blows with Medusa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa’s pretty eyes indifferently swept over the two Mulan Elders. She clenched her delicate hand and a seven colored snake sword flashed and appeared. A fierce glow appeared in her eyes. Her body moved. It rushed toward the two people in a ghost-like manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop her! Quick...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expressions of the two Mulan Elders drastically changed when they saw Medusa’s action as they hurriedly cried out. They clearly understood that with the current strength of the both of them, it was impossible for them to be a match with Medusa. Having lost the ‘Three Beast Savage Skill’, they were just ordinary peak Dou Huangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding Mulan Valley’s experts hesitated for a moment after hearing the cry of the two Mulan Elders. After which, they could only grit their teeth and charge at Medusa. The Dou Qi within their bodies was unleashed to their limit as numerous sharp air tearing sounds appeared in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa’s face did not change even a little in the face of the attacks that were rushing over from all directions. Her hand formed a seal and a countless number of seven colored energy pillars surged out of her body. After which, they appeared like a countless number of enormous seven colored snakes as they rushed out and collided with the many attacks. Unceasing thunder-like explosions resounded over the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the energy explosion waves spread through the air, the faces of the weaker experts from the Mulan Valley turned pale, and they immediately hurried back in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe many experts that surrounded and attacked Medusa did not pose the slightest hindrance to her. The strength of a Dou Zong was indeed extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan undoubtedly appeared miserable when compared to her. In name, he might be able to fight with an elite Dou Zong by using all of his strength, but this was on the precondition that he must exhaust all his strength. Moreover, after the fight, he would enter a weakened state even if he was lucky to avoid serious injuries. Regardless of what kind of powerful Dou Skill Xiao Yan possessed, his actual strength was merely that of a one star Dou Huang. There was still an extremely large gap to a genuine elite Dou Zong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combined strength of all the experts from the Mulan Valley did not cause Medusa’s body to show any signs of slowing. Hence, after a couple of flashes, she appeared beside the two Mulan Elders, who were swiftly withdrawing. Her exquisitely bewitching face revealed a dense, cold expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of the two Mulan Elder changed when they saw Medusa charging through the hinderance of so many experts in such a swift manner. Their bodies moved back as they let out a sudden furious roar. Both of their hands immediately overlapped one another and a rich blood-colored energy agglomerated on their fists. An instant later, tyrannical blood-red wings were created and violently smashed toward Medusa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa moved her delicate hand as her gaze indifferently observed the two people who were struggling on the brink of death. It gently collided with the fists of the two people. Immediately, a seven colored energy poured out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrug! Grug! Grug! Grug! Grug! Grug! Grug! Grug! Grug!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis collision might have appeared gentle, but the bodies of the two Mulan Elders shook intensely. They appeared to have received a heavy blow as their bodies were dragged on the ground as they shot back. Fresh blood splattered wildly from their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without the ‘Three Beast Savage Skill,’ you aren’t people who can even last one exchange with this Queen!” Medusa could not help but coldly chuckle when she saw the two Mulan Elder’s miserable manner after merely one strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of the two Mulan Elders were shocked as their feet rubbed against the ground, forming a long scar. Their bodies had just stabilized when they split and fled without any prior agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA seven colored golden glow instantly arrived just as the two figures were about to move. It carried a sharp sword glow and penetrated the body of one of them, turning into a bloody arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the final Mulan Elder glanced toward the blood arrow that was shot. The shock in his heart became denser. He did not expect that they would be killed as easily as a chicken in Medusa’s hands despite their strength. The strength of a Dou Zong was indeed frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fleeing speed of that Mulan Elder suddenly increased with the urge of the shock within his heart. However, at this moment, his body abruptly stiffened. The trauma on his face also paused at this moment. He lowered his head slowly with some difficulty only to see a sharp sword tip being revealed, carrying the bright-red traces of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe life force in his eyes swiftly scattered as the fresh blood dripped down from the sword. Finally, the Mulan Elder’s body fell in front of the many stunned gazes around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seven colored snake sword in Medusa’s hand slowly disappeared. Her eyes were cold and indifferent as she slowly swept them around. Following the sweeping motion of her gaze, the surrounding experts from the Mulan Valley hurriedly withdrew with traumatized faces. In their hearts, Medusa was just like a fierce god who had just killed two experts at the peak of the Dou Huang class within a short couple of exchanges. This skill was really vicious…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa withdrew her gaze and lowered her body. She pulled off the Storage Ring on that Mulan Elder’s hand in front of the countless number of people. After which she slowly walked back and removed the Storage Ring from the other Elder. Only after doing this did she slowly ascend into the sky. Her body transformed into a ray of light that rushed out of the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a single expert from the Mulan Valley dared to stop Medusa as she walked off in an extremely arrogant manner. This was because they knew that they did not have the slightest ability to retaliate in the hands of an elite Dou Zong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mulan Valley had undoubtedly suffered terrible losses tonight. Through the hands of Xiao Yan and Medusa, blood flowed like river over the entire camp…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa was unhindered as she charged out of the camp. She saw Xiao Yan still in the air outside the camp. The latter had clearly sighed in relief when he saw her. He swiftly said, “Let’s hurry and leave. The experts from the Gold Geese Sect are about to arrive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa’s eyes drifted toward the western side when she heard his words. Numerous ray of lights filled with furious roars were swiftly rushing over from that direction. Clearly, the people from the Gold Geese Sect had discovered that their sect leader had already died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa slightly nodded. Her body moved and appeared beside Xiao Yan. She immediately extended her delicate hand and grabbed Xiao Yan’s wrist in front of Xiao Yan’s stunned eyes. The both of them seemed to be like falling stars in the sky as they rushed out of the city in a lightning-like manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the frightening aura of Medusa spreading, the experts who were guarding the city wall did not dare to act carelessly despite the great shock and anger in their hearts. Hence, they could only watch as the two rushed out of the city and disappeared into the distant night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA majestic aura suddenly spread from the middle of the city where the Poison Sect was located after Xiao Yan and Medusa left the city. However, after this aura discovered that it could not catch up with them, it could only ‘unwillingly’ withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo human figures slowly came to a stop in the night sky far from the city. They sighed in relief when they saw that there were no pursuers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan exhaled for a long time as a smile surfaced on his face. Tonight was really stimulating… the death of two elite Dou Zongs was sufficient to cause the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley to become crazy. In the future, they would likely no longer have the courage to come and attack the Jia Ma Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you alright?” Xiao Yan turned his head, and looked at Medusa, whose delicate hand was gently pushing away a thread of black hair that was on her forehead. His voice was soft as he asked and his concerned tone could not be hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as that Little Fairy Doctor doesn’t intervene, no one in the city can stop me.” Medusa shook her head slightly when she heard Xiao Yan’s words. Without realizing it, the coldness in her pretty eyes quietly disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled. He was just about to speak when a commotion was transmitted from the mountain forest below. A large number of human figures rose into the sky. At a glance, these were not their pursuers, but Hai Bodong’s group who had been lying in ambush here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHai Bodong’s group heaved a sigh of relief after having revealed themselves and seeing that Xiao Yan and Medusa were fine. The former smiled and asked, “How is it? We just saw that the city has turned chaotic and were just about to charge in to receive the both of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were successful. The final hidden danger had been completely removed.” Xiao Yan grinned and nodded as he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA joy that was difficult to hide surged onto the faces of Hai Bodong and the others when they heard this. They exchanged looks with each other and emitted a cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan also laughed when he saw that everyone was so excited. He took out the Storage Ring that he had stuffed in his breast pocket and placed with it a little. After which, he inserted his Spiritual Strength into it. He flipped his hand a moment latter and a scroll that was made of dense white beast bones appeared in it. Atop the beast bones were a couple of blood characters that appeared to be formed from fresh blood that flashed in a glaring manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three Beast Savage Skill!
