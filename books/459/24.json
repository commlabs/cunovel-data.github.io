Day of Leopardstown, frosty morning and road glistening like pewter, and the grass crackling underfoot, stiff with hoar. The little race-course at the foot of the mountains. Crowds stamping in the friendly cold. The horses jibbing, curving under their jockeys at the starting-wire. Flash of jockeys\u0027 colors, gold and green, red and white, all sorts of blue—sky, sea, St. Patrick\u0027s. The drop of the flag. The flying wedge of stretching mounts and huddled riders. Thunder of hoofs coming to jumps, hurdling, lightning spring and over, larruping canter toward the next, smack of crop, over, by Heaven! The hedge now and the five-barred gate, and the stretch toward the judges\u0027 stand. A mad cheering and the clanging of a great bell.

She wore a great frieze coat, like a man\u0027s, and a riding-hat, like a man\u0027s too. At a little distance she seemed like a boy in clothes too big for him, and as one came nearer, one noticed, between the collar and the brim of the hat, the sweet narrow neck and the hair gathered up like some very little girl\u0027s. There was something heart-pulling in it, like a child\u0027s curled fingers. And then she turned, and her face showed, pointed like a cub fox\u0027s. The cheeks flushed with the cold, the lips with a merry smile, her eyes with a deeper smile—there were so many there who knew her, and to whom O\u0027Conor was presented, including an Irish duchess, with a voice like a saw, who rasped; \"H\u0027 a\u0027 yo?\" and then wailed, \"My God! D\u0027 yo\u0027 ever see such a God-forsaken bunch o\u0027 mokes in all your life?\" And a tall, thin baronet who asked him was he one of the O\u0027Conors of Baltimore, to which he replied, no, that he was one of the O\u0027Conors of Forty-seventh Street and Seventh Avenue. \"Ah, yes! Ah, yes!\" There was a French cavalry officer buying horses in Ireland, a dark, thin man with a heavy mustache, who looked more like a New York plain-clothes policeman than a hero of Algiers.
