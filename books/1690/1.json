{"id":64280,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003eTHIS is a \u0027tall story\u0027 about devilry, though it has behind it a serious \u0027point\u0027 which I have tried to make in my Abolition of Man. In the story the outer rim of that devilry had to be shown touching the life of some ordinary and respectable profession. I selected my own profession, not, of course, because I think Fellows of Colleges more likely to be thus corrupted than anyone else, but because my own profession is naturally that which I know best. A very small university is imagined because that has certain conveniences for fiction. Edgestow has no resemblance, save for its smallness, to Durham - a university with which the only connection I have ever had was entirely pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn reducing the original story to a length suitable for this edition, I believe I have altered nothing but the tempo and the manner. I myself prefer the more leisurely pace-I would not wish even War and Peace or The Faerie Qyeene any shorter-but some critics may well think this abridgment is also an improvement. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/that-hideous-strength-space-trilogy-3/page-1.html","bookId":1690,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:05 AM"}
