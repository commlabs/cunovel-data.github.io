It\u0027s a weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is--\" he began in a stern voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, your house. And I\u0027m your daughter, and until I\u0027m on my own I\u0027ll live by your rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least you were paying attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been saying it to me since I was two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been sneaking out since you could walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, it won\u0027t happen again,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed him his soda that was sitting on the coffee table and gave him a good-night hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you had a good time at Aunt Libby\u0027s,\" he said. \"But I\u0027m also glad you\u0027re back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too, Dad. Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhausted, I crawled into bed without even removing my rain- dampened clothes. I switched off the Edward Scissorhands light on my nightstand and licked my lips. Alexander\u0027s kisses still lingered on my mouth. I curled up with my Mickey Malice plush, wishing I were holding Alexander instead. As I lay in bed, I tossed and turned. I couldn\u0027t wait for tomorrow\u0027s sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, I felt a presence stirring in the quiet. I glanced around, but all the shadows were from the furniture. I checked under my bed; even a bat couldn\u0027t squeeze between all the junk I had stashed underneath it. I opened my closet door, but the only clothes I found were on hangers or strewn on the floor. I tiptoed to my window and pulled back the curtain, looking out into our backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander?\" I saw a darkened figure walking away from the house, into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, my love,\" I said, pressing my hand to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned to bed and fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, I awoke with a jolt. Yesterday\u0027s events seemed like a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I rose in my stiffened clothes, I realized that those events were real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you still in your outfit from yesterday?\" my mom nagged when I entered the kitchen. \"Don\u0027t they talk about proper hygiene in health class?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my haggard eyes and stumbled to the bathroom. I peeled off my day-old clothes and stepped into the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm water flowed over my pale skin. My black nail and toe polish looked stark against the clear white tub and tile that surrounded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was back in Dullsville and Alexander was in his Mansion. We could finally live our lives together. But my boyfriend was a vampire and his nemesis had come to hunt him down. I\u0027d never thought Dullsville could be so, well, not dull!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whole life had changed in just a few days. For sixteen years I\u0027d been living the same monotonous existence. My greatest concern had been finding black nail polish in a pastel town. Now it was getting through a sun-filled day alone while Alexander slept peacefully in his Mansion. We wouldn\u0027t be able to go for afternoon bike rides, meet after school, or spend our weekend days hanging out. It was hard to imagine that I wouldn\u0027t ever be able to share sunlight with him. I was beginning to have doubts that I could handle this new world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a blast! I bought you this,\" I said, and handed Becky a package as we sat on the Evans Park swings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened a Hello Kitty journal. \"Cool. Thanks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have the best stores ever! And I went to a place called the Coffin Club. I met this weird guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Matt and I just went to the movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I tell you a secret, a super-duper colossal secret, do you promise not to tell anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I tell Matt?\" she asked eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt, Matt, Matt--who cared about Matt when I was bursting to tell her about my encounter with Jagger and the truth about Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we talking about Matt when I have the biggest news of a lifetime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you always talk about Alexander,\" she barked back. Her porcelain cheeks flushed ruby red. \"And I listen to you all the time. Just \u0027cause you went away and had exciting things happen doesn\u0027t mean I didn\u0027t, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised by Becky\u0027s outburst. It had been only a few days since she had hooked up with Matt, but if she felt for him half of what I felt for Alexander, I\u0027d have to understand her intensity. Becky had always been so mousy. Now that she had her own beau, she had become more confident. Our relationship had changed. We had never had anyone before but each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said, reluctantly. \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m glad you are going out with Matt. Someone as awesome as you should have an awesome boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Raven. Now, what were you going to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused, debating if she could handle the vampirey info.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Matt going to show up here again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"He\u0027s right behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I had my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Monster Girl, how\u0027s Monster Boy?\" a male voice called as I left the park. I glanced around to find Trevor in his red-and-white soccer uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I was done with you. Are you always going to be in my face?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you wear black I will be. Have you two made any Monster Babies yet?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but when we do, I\u0027ll be sure to name one after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked away, and Trevor continued to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do it? Play soccer, spend your daddy\u0027s money, and annoy people, all at the same time?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could do more than annoy you, if you\u0027d let me,\" he said, coyly fixing his green eyes on me. \"So that line isn\u0027t working on the cheerleaders anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Trevor had ever truly bothered me before, he was now just a pest given what I\u0027d recently been through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still think there\u0027s something fishy going on in that mansion,\" he said, unrelenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it a rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s strange that Alexander\u0027s never seen during the day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you weren\u0027t seen during the day. Besides, he\u0027s homeschooled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom told me she spotted that freaky butler man hanging out at the butcher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That is strange. The butler eats food. Who knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He requested \u0027the freshest, bloodiest meat you have.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you prefer they drink your blood?\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a life,\" I said. \"Maybe your mom should be paying attention to you more and gossiping less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave my mother--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t have time for you or your mother anymore. Maybe it\u0027s time you get a new best friend,\" I said, and walked away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-14.html","bookId":1867,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM"}
