{"id":44671,"no":5,"title":"Friday","content":"What do you think, Daddy? The English instructor said that my last\n\u003cbr\u003e paper shows an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. \n\u003cbr\u003e Those were her words. It doesn\u0027t seem possible, does it,\n\u003cbr\u003e considering the eighteen years of training that I\u0027ve had? The aim\n\u003cbr\u003e of the John Grier Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of)\n\u003cbr\u003e is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early\n\u003cbr\u003e age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hope that I don\u0027t hurt your feelings when I criticize the home\n\u003cbr\u003e of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become\n\u003cbr\u003e too impertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques. \n\u003cbr\u003e That isn\u0027t a very polite thing to say--but you can\u0027t expect me\n\u003cbr\u003e to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn\u0027t a young ladies\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e finishing school.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You know, Daddy, it isn\u0027t the work that is going to be hard in college. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the play. Half the time I don\u0027t know what the girls are\n\u003cbr\u003e talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one\n\u003cbr\u003e but me has shared. I\u0027m a foreigner in the world and I don\u0027t understand\n\u003cbr\u003e the language. It\u0027s a miserable feeling. I\u0027ve had it all my life. \n\u003cbr\u003e At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me. \n\u003cbr\u003e I was queer and different and everybody knew it. I could FEEL\n\u003cbr\u003e `John Grier Home\u0027 written on my face. And then a few charitable\n\u003cbr\u003e ones would make a point of coming up and saying something polite. \n\u003cbr\u003e I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the charitable ones most of all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum. I told\n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind\n\u003cbr\u003e old gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true\n\u003cbr\u003e so far as it goes. I don\u0027t want you to think I am a coward,\n\u003cbr\u003e but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home\n\u003cbr\u003e looming over my childhood is the one great big difference. \n\u003cbr\u003e If I can turn my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think,\n\u003cbr\u003e I might be just as desirable as any other girl. I don\u0027t believe\n\u003cbr\u003e there\u0027s any real, underneath difference, do you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e (Nee Jerusha.)\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59727.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
