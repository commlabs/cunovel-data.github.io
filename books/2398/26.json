It looked like Dr. Banerjee was skipping town, and with him, her last chance to find out the secret Nisha had died for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let herself into the Landrys’ house with Ethan’s key. As she pushed the door open, she wondered if she should have knocked instead. But inside, everything was dark and still. The sounds of a daytime talk show came from under Mrs. Landry’s closed bedroom door, and Emma sighed in relief. She hated to admit it, but running into Ethan’s mom—seeing the startled, nervous look in her mousy eyes—set her on edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma got a Coke Zero from the fridge and trudged to Ethan’s room. His bed was perfectly made, with hospital corners and everything, his plain white pillows stacked neatly at the top—she’d watched him make it that morning, his lip between his teeth in concentration. His OCD side was kind of adorable. She blushed a little as she settled onto the bed, thinking that she and Ethan had been cuddling here just a few hours earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePropping herself up against the headboard with some pillows, she pulled his laptop onto her legs. She chewed on the end of a lock of hair, then typed “Emma Paxton” into the search field—and regretted it almost immediately. The case was everywhere, and Emma herself was the star of the show. It was like a horrible, nightmare version of the headlines she used to write about herself—only now they were real. Rags to Riches, one news site proclaimed in enormous type, and underneath: Emma Paxton lived in squalor and dreamed of escape. How far would she go to get what she wanted? Every bad picture anyone had ever taken of her was now online, looking somehow sinister. She recognized Clarice’s house in several of them—Travis had obviously been snapping photos of her without her knowledge. One even showed her sleeping, her mouth open and her tank top’s spaghetti strap hanging off one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA website called On the Q-T had interviewed Clarice herself. Emma scrolled down the page, full of pictures of her old room and stories about how disturbed Emma had seemed. She told me she was working at a roller coaster, but I heard afterward that she was involved with some kind of exotic dance troupe. She used to flounce around here in short-shorts and halter tops, but I’m so naïve I didn’t realize what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma clicked through link after link, her heart sinking. Not one person seemed to even consider that she might be innocent. A task force called CIT—Coalition of Identical Twins—called her a monster and demanded her immediate arrest. Former classmates from Vegas, most of whom Emma didn’t remember ever talking to, portrayed her as a shady, calculating thug. Another blog interviewed Hollier students who swore up and down that they’d suspected her all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, someone at Hollier had put up a Sutton Mercer remembrance page, filled with pictures of Sutton, Elton John’s “Candle in the Wind” playing as background music. A guestbook was already filled with comments from Sutton’s classmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read the page over Emma’s shoulder. Would everyone talk about what a bully I’d been? Would they say I’d deserved what I got? Would anyone even miss me? But most of the comments were superficial. I will always remember how pretty she looked for Junior Prom, someone named wildcat_chick had posted. I had such a crush on her in eighth grade, another comment read, and Remember her sixteenth birthday party? That night made Hollier history! It seemed like no one really knew me underneath my shiny, popular exterior. Then again, I hadn’t exactly let many people see past that part of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma seemed to realize the same thing. She opened Twitter, certain that she would find something from Gabby and Lili. Sure enough, they’d been commenting on the whole situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@LILI_FIORELLO: Calling it now: It’s a prank. This is too crazy to be real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@GABBY_FIORELLO: Sutton Mercer wouldn’t let herself be taken out by some flimsy black market knock-off bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@LILI_FIORELLO: Joke is getting stale. Cross your heart and hope to die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, a few hours later, simply:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@GABBY_FIORELLO: Sutton, we love you and will miss you forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them had changed their user pictures to black squares. Emma’s heart ached. She knew Sutton and her friends had never been touchy-feely, but she also knew that below the surface, they cared deeply about one another. Then she suddenly realized: Gabby and Lili were twins, too. She wondered if they believed the rumors that Emma had killed her own sister. Maybe they were joining CIT at that very moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor hours Emma sat bent over the computer, reading story after story and searching for clues. When a car door slammed outside, Emma was shocked to see it was already three. Tiptoeing to the window that looked over the front of the house, she pulled aside a slat in Ethan’s Venetian blinds—and froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cop car had pulled into the driveway, and Ethan was getting out of the passenger door. He paused to say something to the officer in the front—Corcoran again. She recognized the buzzed auburn hair. Then Ethan nodded and walked toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met him in the entryway. He looked tired but calm, his backpack slung across one shoulder behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” she exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay.” He went to her, dropping his backpack on the floor next to him. As he straightened back up, she saw a scar on his temple she’d never noticed before, curving out from his hairline. She wanted suddenly to kiss it. “I went in willingly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s jaw fell open. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t just sit here and do nothing. They need to know you’re innocent.” He raised his hand and cupped her cheek in his palm. “I told them I was blindsided by the news that you were really Emma but that I didn’t care. I said that I love you, whoever you are—and that I believed you were innocent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis touch on her face made her feel momentarily light-headed. The chill that had swept across her skin when she saw the cop car was replaced by a warm tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan’s voice dropped low. “And I told them I’d seen Garrett running up to the canyon, the night Sutton died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. “Wait, what? If you saw Garrett the night of the murder, why didn’t you tell me earlier?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked from side to side, though they seemed to be completely alone in the hall. “I didn’t really. But it was the only way I could think of to get the cops to look at him more closely. You saw his car in the parking lot security stills, right? I may not have seen him, but he was out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ethan, do you realize how deep a hole you’re digging for yourself?” she hissed. “Don’t lie to the cops again—not for me. Isn’t it bad enough that I’ve been lying to everyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand dropped away from her cheek, and he looked down at his feet. “I’m sorry. I just—I thought it would help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door opened somewhere in the house, the quick patter of a local used-car commercial drifting through. Ethan glanced furtively into the hallway. After a moment there was the sound of a toilet flushing, and then the door closed again and the TV became muffled and distant once more. Mrs. Landry had retreated back to her cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma took a deep breath. Garrett had been in the canyon, after all. Maybe Ethan was right—now the cops had to look into Sutton’s ex. “You’re right,” she said, touching his shoulder. “Thank you. I’m sorry for snapping. I’m just so afraid that the cops are going to pull you into this, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Emma, I’d do anything for you. I want to keep you safe.” He stooped to unzip his backpack, and when he stood back up he shoved something in her hands. She looked down to see a burner cell phone, still in the package. “I also swung by Radio Shack and got this for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her weight. The box felt strangely heavy in her hands. “You’ve already spent so much money on me, Ethan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but you need a phone,” he said. “Now I’m just a call away. If you need me, I’ll come running.” He wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her close to him. The contact sent a warm glow through her body, and she hugged his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, I really need to catch up on my calculus,” he said, resting his forehead against hers. “But when I’m done, how about we grab some takeout and have a picnic? I know a great little spot just a few feet from here where the paparazzi will never find us. It’s right behind my house, in fact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “You mean your yard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve heard of it!” he teased. “Come on. You, me, the mood lighting of the citronella candle. The best tom kha gai in town . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m there,” she said, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I watched them, it was almost like my heart came unclenched for a moment. Even with all the madness in her life, my sister had found someone who really cared for her. When I saw the way he looked at her, it made me hope that someday, when this was all over, they would be able to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was glad they’d have each other when—if—that time came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEMMA PAXTON: MASTER OF DISGUISE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have a nice afternoon, miss.” A thin, white-bearded man wearing a flannel shirt and an apron handed Emma her bag of groceries and gave her a quizzical look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma tugged self-consciously at her skirt. It was Wednesday, and she was incognito again, in Mrs. Landry’s blonde wig, a denim jumper embroidered with butterflies, and a red turtleneck sweater she’d gotten at Goodwill. Plastic dime-store glasses completed the look—she was a dead ringer for the Sunday school teacher she’d had during her few weeks with the Morgans, a particularly pious foster family back in Nevada. She couldn’t believe it had come to this to just buy milk; but the reporters—or Garrett—could be anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exited the store and walked across the parking lot toward Ethan’s car, her shadow flickering across the asphalt at her feet. Next to the home improvement store was a Burger King, a line of cars stretching around the drive-through. Just as she dropped the groceries in the car, someone laid on his horn, impatient to make an order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she saw next made her stop in her tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis had just stepped out of the Burger King, a thirty-two ounce soft drink in his hand. He paused in the doorway, pulling a pair of cheap aviators down over his eyes, before slouching up the street in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma didn’t waste any time. Slamming the car door shut, she followed him on foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe area was a cheap commercial zone, lined with big-box stores and chain restaurants. A thin strip of weeds ran between the road and the sidewalk, dotted with overflowing trash cans. She walked slowly, letting Travis stay several feet ahead but keeping him in her line of sight. He wore a backward-facing baseball cap and saggy jeans hanging down almost off his butt. A wallet chain went from his belt loop to his back pocket. When he glanced behind him, she ducked into a crowd of people at a bus stop, trying to keep her face as bored as all the other commuters’ expressions. When she was sure he’d turned away, she followed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis passed an abandoned mechanics’ garage tagged with graffiti, then cut across the parking lot to a Days Inn Hotel. The pool shone behind the cast-iron gate, three small children in inflatable water wings squealing in the shallow end. Emma hung back and watched as Travis climbed the steps and let himself into one of the rooms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-minutes-in-heaven-the-lying-game-6/page-26.html","bookId":2398,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:03 AM"}
