{"id":20593,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. BAD ADVICE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Roswell pursued his way home with a general sense of discontent. Why should he be so much worse off than Richard Hunter, who had only been a ragged boot-black three years before? The whole world seemed to be in a conspiracy to advance Richard, and to keep him down. To think he should be only earning six dollars a week, while Dick, whom he considered so far beneath him, was receiving twenty, was really outrageous. And now he had pushed a low dependent of his into Baker\u0027s store where Roswell was obliged to associate with him! \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Certainly Roswell\u0027s grievances were numerous. But there was one thing he did not understand, that the greatest obstacle to his advancement was himself. If he had entered any situation with the determination to make his services valuable, and discharge his duties, whatever they might be, with conscientious fidelity, he would have found his relations with his employer much more agreeable and satisfactory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Crawford still kept the house in Clinton Place, letting nearly all the rooms to lodgers. In this way she succeeded in making both ends meet, though with considerable difficulty, so that she had not the means to supply Roswell with the spending money he desired. Her nephew, James Gilbert, Richard Huntley\u0027s predecessor as book-keeper, still boarded with her. It will be remembered by the readers of \"Fame and Fortune,\" that this Gilbert, on being questioned by Mr. Rockwell as to his share in the plot against Dick, had angrily resigned his position, thinking, probably, that he should lose it at any rate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It so happened that business was generally depressed at this time, and it was three months before he succeeded in obtaining another place, and then he was compelled to work for eight hundred dollars, or two hundred less than he had formerly received. This was a great disappointment to him, and did not help his temper much, which had never been very sweet. He felt quite exasperated against Dick, whom, very much against his wishes, he had seen the means of promoting to his own place. Indeed, on this point, he sympathized heartily with Roswell, whose dislike to Richard Hunter has already been shown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, mother,\" said Roswell, as he entered Mrs. Crawford\u0027s presence, \"I\u0027m getting tired of Baker\u0027s store.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t say so, Roswell,\" said his mother, in alarm. \"Remember how long it took you to get the place.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have to work like a dog for six dollars a week,\" said Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said his cousin, with a sneer, \"that\u0027s precisely the way you work. Dogs spend their time running round the street doing nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I have to work hard enough,\" said Roswell, \"but I wouldn\u0027t mind that so much, if I didn\u0027t have to associate with low match boys.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean, Roswell?\" asked his mother, who did not understand the allusion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Baker hired a new boy to-day, and who do you think he turns out to be?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not that boy, Ragged Dick?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, you don\u0027t think he would give up Cousin James\u0027 place, where he gets a thousand dollars a year, to go into Baker\u0027s as boy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who was it, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He used to be a ragged match boy about the streets. Dick Hunter picked him up somewhere, and got him a situation in our store, on purpose to spite me, I expect.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the reader is aware, Roswell was mistaken in his supposition, as Mark obtained the place on his own responsibility.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The boot-black seems to be putting on airs,\" said Mrs. Crawford.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, he pretends to be the guardian of this match boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the boy\u0027s name?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mark Manton.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If I were Mr. Baker,\" said Mrs. Crawford, \"I should be afraid to take a street boy into my employ. Very likely he isn\u0027t honest.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish he would steal something,\" said Roswell, not very charitably. \"Then we could get rid of him, and the boot-black would be pretty well mortified about it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027ll be found out sooner or later,\" said Mrs. Crawford. \"You may depend on that. You\u0027d better keep a sharp lookout for him, Roswell. If you catch him in stealing, it will help you with Mr. Baker, or ought to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This would have comforted Roswell more, but that he was privately of opinion that Mark was honest, and would not be likely to give him any chance of detecting him in stealing. Still, by a little management on his part, he might cause him to fall under suspicion. It would of course be miserably mean on his part to implicate a little boy in a false charge; but Roswell was a mean boy, and he was not scrupulous where his dislike was concerned. He privately decided to think over this new plan for getting Mark into trouble.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Isn\u0027t dinner ready, mother?\" he asked, rather impatiently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It will be in about ten minutes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m as hungry as a bear.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can always do your part at the table,\" said his cousin unpleasantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know why I shouldn\u0027t. I have to work hard enough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are always talking about your hard work. My belief is that you don\u0027t earn your wages.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think it was a pity if I didn\u0027t earn six dollars a week,\" said Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come, James, you\u0027re always hard on Roswell,\" said Mrs. Crawford. \"I am sure he has hard times enough without his own relations turning against him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n James Gilbert did not reply. He was naturally of a sarcastic turn, and, seeing Roswell\u0027s faults, was not inclined to spare them. He might have pointed them out, however, in a kindly manner, and then his young cousin might possibly been benefited; but Gilbert felt very little interest in Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Immediately after dinner Roswell took up his cap. His mother observed this, and inquired, \"Where are you going, Roswell?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m going out to walk.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why don\u0027t you go with your cousin?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n James Gilbert had also taken his hat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He don\u0027t want to be bothered with me,\" said Roswell, and this statement Gilbert did not take the trouble to contradict.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why can\u0027t you stay in and read?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I haven\u0027t got anything to read. Besides I\u0027ve been cooped up in the store all day, and I want to breathe a little fresh air.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was reason in this, and his mother did not gainsay it, but still she felt that it was not quite safe for a boy to spend his evenings out in a large city, without any one to look after him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell crossed Broadway, and, proceeding down Eighth Street, met a boy of about his own age in front of the Cooper Institute.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How long have you been waiting, Ralph?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not long. I only just came up.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I couldn\u0027t get away as soon as I expected. Dinner was rather late.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have a cigar, Roswell?\" asked Ralph.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said Roswell, \"I don\u0027t mind.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll find these cigars pretty good. I paid ten cents apiece.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see how you can afford it,\" said Roswell. \"Your cigars must cost you considerable.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t always buy ten-centers. Generally I pay only five cents.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, that mounts up when you smoke three or four in a day. Let me see, what wages do you get?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Seven dollars a week.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s only a dollar more than I get,\" said Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know one thing, it\u0027s miserably small,\" said Ralph. \"We ought to get twice what we do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"These shop-keepers are awfully mean,\" said Roswell, beginning to puff away at his cigar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But still you always seem to have plenty of money. That\u0027s what puzzles me,\" said Roswell. \"I\u0027m always pinched. I have to pay my mother all my wages but a dollar a week. And what\u0027s a dollar?\" he repeated, scornfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Ralph, \"my board costs me all but a dollar. So we are about even there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you pay your board out of your earnings?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have to. My governor won\u0027t foot the bills, so I have to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Still you seem to have plenty of money,\" persisted Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I look out for that,\" said Ralph Graham, significantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I don\u0027t see how you manage. I might look out all day, and I wouldn\u0027t be any the better off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps you don\u0027t go the right way to work,\" said his companion, taking the cigar from his mouth, and knocking off the ashes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I wish you\u0027d tell me the right way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, the fact is,\" said Ralph, slowly, \"I make my employer pay me higher wages than he thinks he does.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see how you can do that,\" said Roswell, who didn\u0027t yet understand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ralph took the cigar, now nearly smoked out, from his mouth, and threw it on the pavement. He bent towards Roswell, and whispered something in his ear. Roswell started and turned pale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But,\" he said, \"that\u0027s dishonest.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hush!\" said Ralph, \"don\u0027t speak so loud. Oughtn\u0027t employers to pay fair wages,—tell me that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But if they don\u0027t and won\u0027t, what then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I do. We must help ourselves, that is all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But,\" said Roswell, \"what would be thought of you if it were found out?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s plenty of clerks that do it. Bless you, it\u0027s expected. I heard a man say once that he expected to lose about so much by his clerks.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I think it would be better to pay good wages.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So do I, only you see they won\u0027t do it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How much do you—do you make outside of your salary?\" asked Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"From three to five dollars a week.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think they\u0027d find you out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t let them. I\u0027m pretty careful. Well, what shall we do this evening? There\u0027s a pretty good play at Niblo\u0027s. Suppose we go there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I haven\u0027t got money enough,\" said Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I\u0027ll pay for both to-night. You can pay another time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right!\" said Roswell, though he did not know when he should have money enough to return the favor. They crossed to Broadway, and walked leisurely to Niblo\u0027s Garden. The performance lasted till late, and it was after eleven when Roswell Crawford got into bed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82475.html","bookId":322,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:52:29 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:52:29 AM"}
