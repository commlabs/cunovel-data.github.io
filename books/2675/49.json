Her heart was in her throat as she withdrew a long blade and then noiselessly moved from the kitchen to the archway leading to the living area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the air from the air conditioner, all Cassie could hear was the crazy knocking of her heart accompanied by her own shallow breathing. But someone was inside, she knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers clamped around the knife’s hilt so tightly that they began to ache. She gazed over the counter, into the darkened living room and thought she spied movement, a darker shadow in the surrounding umbra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hardly dared breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was her cell phone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to call 9-1-1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashed on the cell hooked to her charger it on the night stand in her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo far. She’d have to pass by the living area again and now the intruder knew she was onto him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic rose. Who was inside? What did he want? Why was he here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink, Cassie, think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet out. Get out, now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she could just get around the corner of the kitchen, to the front hall where she could hit the switch and race out the door . . . Oh, God, were those eyes staring back at her, reflecting the barest of light filtering in from the living room window? She didn’t wait to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenaline firing her blood, she tore around the refrigerator, her feet landing on the tile of the small entry. Clutching the butcher knife in one hand, she flipped on the lights in the foyer with the other, and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unlocked door. She knew she’d thrown the bolt before heading to bed. Oh, God, oh, God, oh God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling fixtures flashed on. Bright light nearly blinded her. Holding the knife in front of her with both hands, she fell back a step onto the porch but saw no one in the apartment. No malicious figure appeared. No killer with murderous intent showed himself. For a second she thought she’d imagined it all, that her nightmare had confused her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here she was, standing on her porch, butcher knife in hand feeling like a complete idiot and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the eyes, peering out of the open closet door. Unblinking. Near the floor. Glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart stopped as she tried to imagine what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn animal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“SSSSssss,” the black creature hissed, back arching, teeth showing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick as a lightning bolt, the black fur ball shot by her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost laughed. How ludicrous that she was standing on her front porch in her night shirt, a huge knife clutched in her hands, when all her fears had been about a stupid cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, for the love of St. Peter. Really? An animal of less than twenty pounds had instilled the fear of God in her? Caused her to arm herself? Sent her into panic mode and probably shaved a year off her life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are crazy, Cassie!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSagging against the doorjamb, noticing the sky lightening to the east, she was berating herself for being such a fool when she remembered that she’d locked her apartment. When she’d gone out earlier in the day, and then before she’d turned in for the night. She recalled throwing the dead bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how had the neighbor’s cat ended up inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooseflesh rose on her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new fear slithered through her as she examined the door and found no forced entry. But the cat had gotten in somehow . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt probably snuck in behind you when you weren’t looking, then it hid in a dark corner until the sound of the tree branch woke you up and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was she kidding? The cat had not sneaked unnoticed into the apartment and the door had been locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to pull the door shut when she heard a car’s engine start about a block away from the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had someone been watching?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat turned to sand as the car passed on the street in front of the main house, headlights illuminating the drive for a second as it passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad someone been inside her home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the cat followed whoever it was inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, how did they get in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was racing, trying to figure it out, trying to stay rational, when all of her instincts were to panic. Inside the apartment again, she threw the deadbolt then placed a chair under the door knob and checked all the windows. Shut tight and latched. There was no back door, just the one entrance to her unit. So how . . . ? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-49.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
