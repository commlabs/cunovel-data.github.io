They would say he found it, when in truth what he\u0027d done was trip over what was left of Arnette Gantrey. Either way, the end was the same, and Bobby Lee would live with that wide white face floating into his dreams for a long time to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he hadn\u0027t broken up with Marvella Truesdale-again-the night before, he\u0027d have been hunkered over his desk in English lit, trying to twist his brain into coping with Shakespeare\u0027s Macbeth, instead of dropping his line into Gooseneck Creek. But this last fight in his rocky eighteen-month romance with Marvella had worn him down. Bobby Lee\u0027d decided to take himself a day off, to rest and reflect. And to teach that sharp-tongued Marvella that he wasn\u0027t no pussy-whipped wimp, but a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men in Bobby Lee\u0027s family had always ruled the roost-or pretended to. He wasn\u0027t about to break the tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt nineteen, Bobby Lee was long past grown. He was six one and gawky with it, the filling-out years still to come. But he had big, workingman\u0027s hands, like his father\u0027s, on the ends of long skinny arms, and his mother\u0027s thick black hair and luxuriant lashes. He liked to wear that hair slicked back in the style of his idol, James Dean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Lee considered Dean a man\u0027s man, one who wouldn\u0027t have tolerated book learning any more than Bobby Lee did. If it had been up to him, he\u0027d have been working full-time in Sonny Talbot\u0027s Mobile Service Station and Eatery instead of hacking his way through twelfth grade. But his mama had other notions, and nobody in Innocence, Mississippi, liked to cross Happy Fuller if they could help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappy-whose childhood name was appropriate enough since she could smile beauteously as she sliced you off at the knees-hadn\u0027t quite forgiven her eldest boy for being held back twice in school. If Bobby Lee\u0027s mood hadn\u0027t been so low, he wouldn\u0027t have risked hooking a day, not with his grades already teetering. But Marvella was the kind of girl who pushed a man-a man\u0027s man-into doing rash and reckless things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Bobby Lee dropped his line into the sulky brown waters of Gooseneck Creek and hunched in his faded denim jacket against the raw air. His daddy always said when a man had powerful things on his mind, the best cure was to take himself down to the water and see what was nibbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter if you caught anything, it was the being there that counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn women,\" Bobby Lee muttered, and peeled his lips back in a sneer he\u0027d practiced long hours in the bathroom mirror. \"Damn all women to hell and back again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t need the grief Marvella handed out with both pretty hands. Ever since they\u0027d done the deed in the back of his Cutlass, she\u0027d been picking him apart and trying to put him back together her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t sit right with Bobby Lee Fuller, no indeedy. Not even if she made him dizzy with love when they weren\u0027t scrapping. Not even if she had those big blue eyes that seemed to whisper secrets just for him when they passed each other in the crowded hallways of Jefferson Davis High. And not even if, when he got her naked, she near to fucked his brains out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he loved her, and maybe she was smarter than he was, but he\u0027d be damned if she was going to tug him along like a pig on a rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Lee settled back among the reeds along the skinny creek fed by the mighty Mississippi. He could hear the lonesome whistle from the train that was heading down to Greenville, and the whisper of the damp winter breeze through the limp reeds. His line hung slack and still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing nibbling this morning was his temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he\u0027d just take himself down to Jackson, shake the dust of Innocence off his shoes, and strike out for the city. He was a good mechanic-a damn good one-and figured he could find work with or without a high school diploma. Shitfire. You didn\u0027t need to know nothing about some fag named Macbeth, or obtuse triangles and the like, to fix a dinky carburetor. Down to Jackson he could get himself a job in a garage, end up head mechanic. Hell, he could own the whole kit and kaboodle before too long. And while he was at it, Marvella I-told-you-so Truesdale would be back in Innocence, crying her big blue eyes red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he\u0027d come back. Bobby Lee\u0027s smile lit his tough, good-looking face and warmed his chocolate eyes in a way that would have made Marvella\u0027s heart flutter. Yeah, he\u0027d come back, with twenty-dollar bills bulging in his pockets. He\u0027d cruise on back into town in his classic \u002762 Caddy-one of his fleet of cars-duded up in an Italian suit, and richer than the Longstreets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there would be Marvella, thin and pale from pining away for him. She\u0027d be standing on the corner in front of Larsson\u0027s Dry Goods, clutching her hands between her soft, pillowy breasts, and tears would be streaming down her face at the sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when she fell at his feet, sobbing and wailing and telling him how sorry she was for being such an awful bitch and driving him away from her, he might-just might-forgive her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fantasy lulled him. As the sun brightened to ease the stinging air and danced lightly on the dun-colored water of the creek, he began to contemplate the physical aspects of their reunion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d take her to Sweetwater-having purchased the lovely old plantation from the Longstreets when they\u0027d fallen on hard times. She\u0027d gasp and shiver at his good fortune. Being a gentleman, and a romantic, he\u0027d sweep her up the long, curving stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Bobby Lee hadn\u0027t been above the first floor in Sweetwater, his imagination shifted into high gear. The bedroom he carried the trembling Marvella into resembled a hotel suite in Vegas, which was Bobby Lee\u0027s current idea of class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy red draperies, a heart-shaped bed as big as a lake, carpet so thick he had to wade through it. Music was playing. Something classic, he thought. Bruce Springsteen or Phil Collins. Yeah, Marvella got all gooey over Phil Collins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he\u0027d lie her down on the bed. Her eyes would be wet as he kissed her. She\u0027d be telling him again and again what a fool she\u0027d been, how much she loved him, how she was going to spend the rest of her life making him happy. Making him her king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he\u0027d run his hands down over those incredible white, pink-tipped breasts, squeezing just a little, the way she liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer soft thighs would spread apart, her fingers would dig into his shoulders while she made that growly sound back in her throat. And then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis line tugged. Blinking, Bobby Lee sat up, wincing a little when his jeans bunched against the bulge at his crotch. Distracted by the hard-on, he flicked the fat fish out of the water, where it wriggled in the silvering sun. With his hands clumsy and slippery with arousal, he thumped his catch into the reeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagining himself about to pop it to Marvella had him tangling his line in the reeds. He hauled himself up, swearing a little at his carelessness. Since a good fishing line was as valuable as the fish it caught, Bobby Lee waded into the reeds and began to set it to rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe perch was still flopping. He could hear its wet struggles. Grinning, he gave the line a quick tug. It resisted, and he muttered a half-hearted oath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked a rusted Miller can aside, took another step into the high, cool grass. He slipped, his foot sliding on something wet. Bobby Lee Fuller went down on his knees. And found himself face-to-face with Arnette Gantrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer look of surprise mirrored his-wide eyes, gaping mouth, white white cheeks. The perch lay quivering with its last breaths beneath her naked, mutilated breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw she was dead-stone dead-and that was bad enough. But it was the blood, frosty pools of it, soaking into the damp ground, turning her limp, peroxided hair into something dark and crusty, drying hideously from where it had spilled out of dozens of jagged holes in her flesh, necklacing her throat where a long, smiling gash spread-it was the blood that forced the harsh, animal sounds out of him and had him scrambling back on his hands and knees. He didn\u0027t realize the sounds came from him. But he did realize that he was kneeling in her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Lee struggled to his feet just in time to lose his breakfast grits all over his new black Converse Chucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving his perch, his line, and a good portion of his youth in the bloody reeds, he ran for Innocence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-1.html","bookId":2411,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}
