The conversation with Tam still bounced around in his head. Let go. It wasn’t nearly so easy. And yet, something had lifted from him in speaking with his father. Let go. There seemed a depth to Tam’s words, one far beyond the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand shook his head. He couldn’t afford to waste time on such thoughts. The Last Battle . . . it had to claim his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been able to draw close without drawing attention, he thought, fingering the deerhorn-hilted dagger at his belt. It seems to be true. The Dark One can’t sense me when I carry this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could move against the Dark One, he had to do something about the Seanchan. If what Thom said was true, Mat might be the key. The Seanchan had to join the Dragon’s Peace. If they did not . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is an expression I remember\", a soft voice said. \"Consternation. You do it so well, Rand al’Thor\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned toward Moiraine. Beyond her, on the table in his tent, maps that Aviendha had sent by messenger showed positions where his army could gather in the Blight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoiraine stepped up beside Rand. \"Did you know that I used to spend hours in thought, trying to discover what that mind of yours was conjuring? It is a wonder I did not pull every hair from my head in frustration\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a fool for not trusting you\", Rand said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. A soft laugh, the laugh of an Aes Sedai who was in control. \"You trusted me enough. That was what made it all the more frustrating that you would not share\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand breathed in deeply. The air here at Merrilor was sweeter than in other places. He had coaxed the land here back to life. Grass grew. Flowers budded. \"Tree stumps and men\", he said to Moiraine. \"The Two Rivers has both, and one is about as likely to budge as the other\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps that is too harsh\", Moiraine said. \"It was not merely stubbornness that drove you; it was a will to prove to yourself, and to everyone else, that you could do this on your own\". She touched his arm. \"But you cannot do this on your own, can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand shook his head. He reached up to Callandor; strapped on his back, touching it. The sword’s final secret lay bare to him now. It was a trap, and a clever one, for this weapon was a sa’angreal not for just the One Power, but for the True Power as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had thrown away the access key, but on his back he carried something so very tempting. The True Power, the Dark One’s essence, was the sweetest thing he had ever touched. With Callandor; he could draw it forth in strength such as no man had ever before felt. Because Callandor lacked the safety measures of most other angreal and sa’angreal, there was no telling how much of the Powers it could draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is again\", Moiraine murmured. \"What are you planning, Rand al’Thor, Dragon Reborn? Can you finally let go enough to tell me?\" He eyed her. \"Did you set this entire conversation up to pull that secret from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think very highly of my conversational abilities\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An answer that says nothing\", Rand said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\", Moiraine said. \"But might I point out that you did it first in deflecting my question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand thought back a few steps in the conversation, and realized he’d done just that. \"I’m going to kill the Dark One\", Rand said. \"I’m not just going to seal up the Dark One, I’m going to end him\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you had grown up while I was away\", Moiraine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only Perrin grew up\", Rand said. \"Mat and I have simply learned to pretend to be grown up\". He hesitated. \"Mat did not learn it so well\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dark One is beyond killing\", Moiraine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can do it\", Rand said. \"I remember what Lews Therin did, and there was a moment . . . a brief moment . . . It can happen, Moiraine. I’m more confident that I can do that than I am that I could seal the Dark One away\". That was true, though he had no real confidence that he could manage either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions. So many questions. Shouldn’t he have some answers by now? \"The Dark One is part of the Wheel\", Moiraine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The Dark One is outside the Pattern\", Rand countered. \"Not part of the Wheel at all\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course the Dark One is part of the Wheel, Rand\", Moiraine said. \"We are the threads that make up the Pattern’s substance, and the Dark One affects us. You cannot kill him. That is a fool’s task\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been a fool before\", Rand said. \"And I shall be one again. At times, Moiraine, my entire life—all that I’ve done—feels like a fool’s task. What is one more impossible challenge? I’ve met all the others. Perhaps I can accomplish this one too\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tightened her grip on his arm. \"You have grown so much, but you are still just a youth, are you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand immediately seized control of his emotions, and did not lash back at her. The surest way to be thought of as a youth was to act like one. He stood straight-backed, and spoke softly. \"I have lived for four centuries\", he said. \"Perhaps I am still a youth, in that all of us are, compared to the timeless age of the Wheel itself. That said, I am one of the oldest people in existence\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoiraine smiled. \"Very nice. Does that work on the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. Then, oddly, he found himself grinning. \"It worked pretty well on Cadsuane\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoiraine sniffed. \"That one . . . Well, knowing her, I doubt you fooled her as well as you assume. You may have the memories of a man four centuries old, Rand al’Thor, but that does not make you ancient. Otherwise, Matrim Cauthon would be the patriarch of us all\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat? Why Mat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is nothing\", Moiraine said. \"Something I am not supposed to know. You are still a wide-eyed sheepherder at heart. I would not have it any other way. Lews Therin, for all of his wisdom and power, could not do what you must. Now, if you would be kind, fetch me some tea\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Moiraine Sedai\", he said, immediately starting toward the teapot over the fire. He froze, then looked back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him slyly. \"Merely seeing if that still worked\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never fetched you tea\", Rand protested, walking back to her. \"As I remember, I spent our last few weeks together ordering you around\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you did\", Moiraine said. \"Think about what I said regarding the Dark One. But now I ask you a different question. What will you do now? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-109.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
