Who knew the Crown gave such hearty rewards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Aidan left him at the dock, her father had had second thoughts and reported Fraser to the constable. And though the law hadn’t given two figs for the safety of some farmer’s daughter, they were quite interested in the tale of someone trading men for goods so as to avoid the Crown’s taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he’s out of my hair,” she said, “and finally managing on his own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And in a flat close to his favorite Aberdeen tavern.” He saw a shadow cross her brow—guilt? melancholy?— and he chucked her chin. “Don’t worry for your father. Nor for us. What we got was reward enough,” he said, referring to the bounty both he and Angus had received for their part in stopping Fraser and Captain Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus had felt guilty about the whole matter—Aidan got the impression the man liked to keep a low profile— and so had given Elspeth a half-dozen sheep, two of which were breeding, in addition to pledging his help with their rebuilding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And besides,” he added, cupping her cheek, “all this bounty means I can be alone with you. Until a bairn comes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, knowing as well as he with what diligence they’d been working on that matter. She placed her hand over his. “Oh, husband, how glad I am that you came home, to Scotland, and not some other, more distant shore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re my home.” He removed the lamb from her lap, pulling Elspeth onto his instead. “And we have so much to start anew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lamb cried, standing unsteadily on spindly legs. Elspeth cooed and petted it, a smile in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Aidan eyed the creature, he saw something else, and said with a sniff, “I don’t like Angus giving you all these sheep. The man gives you too many gifts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot him a startled look. “Never before has Angus thought to give me a thing in his life!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm-hm.” He grabbed her hand and kissed her wrist. His wife had no idea just how appealing she could be to a man. Especially now with a bloom in her cheeks, and in her fetching new gown. But it was time for her to pay attention to him. He began to kiss up her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a playful squeeze, her mind clearly still on the sheep. “We need to name them all. Aphrodite perhaps,” she said, studying the wee lamb, now looking amusingly bereft. Elspeth giggled. “She does have such very long lashes. Very comely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuzzling her neck, he seated her more firmly in his lap. His intentions were unmistakable. “You’re the only Aphrodite,” he told her, kissing up her throat, along her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes caught, and he saw his intent matched in her gaze. The rest of the world—their farm, their cares— everything fell away, until it was just the two of them. Aidan reached around to untie her spectacles. Pulling them off, he marveled at how lovely her eyes were. How wise, and sweet, and all-seeing. “You’re the only goddess here. And you’re mine.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-own-clan-macalpin-2/page-54.html","bookId":2657,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:43 AM"}
