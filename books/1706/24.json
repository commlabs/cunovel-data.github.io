Well, if instead of spinning the rope, they shake it up and down, they generate loopy waves that travel along the length of the rope, back and forth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if the girls shake it just right, the waves appear to stop moving back and forth. The rope takes on a single curved shape and holds it. You\u0027ve seen that? Well, that\u0027s a standing wave. It reflects back and forth in perfect synchronization so it doesn\u0027t seem to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And these explosives do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. In nature, standing waves are incredibly powerful. They can shake a suspension bridge to pieces. They can shatter a skyscraper. The most destructive effects of earthquakes are caused by standing waves generated in the crust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Brewster\u0027s got these explosives amp;set in a row amp;for a hundred miles? Isn\u0027t that what Bolden said? A hundred miles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And I think there\u0027s no question what he intends. Our friend Brewster is hoping to fracture the ice for a hundred miles, and break off the biggest iceberg in the history of the planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah stuck her head in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner said, \"Did you find a computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"There\u0027s nothing there. Nothing at all. No sleeping bag, no food, no personal effects. Nothing but a bare tent. The guy\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner swore. \"All right,\" he said. \"Now, listen carefully. Here\u0027s what we are going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO WEDDELL STATION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:22 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" Jimmy Bolden said, shaking his head. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t allow that, Dr. Kenner. It\u0027s too dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it dangerous?\" Kenner said. \"You take these two back to the station, and I\u0027ll follow Brewster\u0027s snowtracks until I meet up with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir, we all stay together, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy,\" Kenner said firmly, \"we\u0027re not going to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With all due respect, sir, you don\u0027t know your way around this part of the world amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forget, I am an IADG inspector,\" Kenner said. \"I was resident in Vostok Station for six months in the winter of \u002799. And I was resident in Morval for three months in \u002791. I know exactly what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, I don\u0027t know amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call back to Weddell. The station chief will confirm it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sir, if you put it that way amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Kenner said firmly. \"Now get these two people back to base. Time is wasting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, if you\u0027ll be all right amp;\" Bolden turned to Evans and Sarah. \"Then I guess we go. Mount up, folks, and we\u0027ll head out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin minutes, Evans and Sarah were jouncing along on the ice, following behind Bolden\u0027s snowtrack. Behind them, Kenner was driving parallel to the line of flags, heading east. Evans looked back just in time to see Kenner stop, get out, check one of the flags briefly, then get back in again and drive on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolden saw it, too. \"What is he doing?\" he said in an anxious tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just looking at the unit, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He shouldn\u0027t be getting out of his vehicle,\" Bolden said. \"And he shouldn\u0027t be alone on the shelf. It\u0027s against regulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah had the feeling Bolden was about to turn back. She said, \"I can tell you something about Dr. Kenner, Jimmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to make him mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Jimmy. You don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well amp;okay then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove on, climbing a long rise, descending on the other side. Brewster\u0027s camp was gone, and so was Kenner\u0027s snowtrack. Ahead lay the vast white field of the Ross Ice Shelf, stretching away to the gray horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hours, folks,\" Bolden said. \"And then a hot shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first hour passed uneventfully. Evans started to fall asleep, only to be jolted awake by the sharp movements of the vehicle. Then he would drift off again, his head nodding until the next shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was driving. He said to her, \"Aren\u0027t you tired?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not at all,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was now low on the horizon, and obscured by fog. The landscape was shades of pale gray, with almost no separation between land and sky. Evans yawned. \"Want me to take over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a good driver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thinking she had a definite bossy side, despite her charm and her beauty. She was the kind of woman who would want to control the remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you want the remote,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\" She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was irritating in a certain way, he thought, that she did not take him seriously as a man. At least, not as a man she could be interested in. In truth, she was a little too cool for his taste. A little too ice blond. A little too controlled, beneath that beautiful exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio clicked. Bolden said, \"I don\u0027t like this weather coming in. We better take a shortcut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What shortcut?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only half a mile, but it\u0027ll save twenty minutes on our time. Follow me.\" He turned his snowtrack left, leaving the packed snow road, and heading off onto the ice fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Sarah said. \"Right behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good work,\" Bolden said. \"We\u0027re still an hour from Weddell. I know this route, it\u0027s a piece of cake. Just stay directly behind me. Not to the left or right, but directly behind, you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a matter of minutes, they had moved several hundred yards from the road. The ice there was bare and hard, the treads of the snowtracks scratching and squeaking as they crossed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re on ice now,\" Bolden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t be long now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans was looking out the window. He could no longer see the road. In fact, he wasn\u0027t sure anymore in which direction it lay. Everything now looked the same. He felt anxious suddenly. \"We\u0027re really in the middle of nowhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowtrack slid laterally a little, across the ice. He grabbed for the dashboard. Sarah immediately brought the vehicle back under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez,\" Evans said, clinging to the dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a nervous passenger?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad we can\u0027t get some music. Is there any way to get music?\" she asked Bolden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should,\" Bolden said. \"Weddell broadcasts twenty-four hours. Just a minute.\" He stopped his snowtrack, and walked back to their stopped vehicle. He climbed up on the tread and opened the door, in a blast of freezing air. \"Sometimes you get interference from this,\" he said, and unclipped the transponder from the dash. \"Okay. Try your radio now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah fiddled with the receiver, twisting the knob. Bolden walked back to his red cab, carrying the transponder. His diesel engine spit a cloud of black exhaust as he put the snowtrack in gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they\u0027d be a little more ecologically minded,\" Evans said, looking at the exhaust as Bolden\u0027s snowtrack chugged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting any music,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" Evans said. \"I don\u0027t care that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove another hundred yards. Then Bolden stopped again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolden climbed out of his vehicle, walked to the back of it, and looked at his own treads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was still fiddling with the radio. Punching the buttons for the different transmission frequencies, she got bursts of static for each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure this is an improvement,\" Evans said. \"Just let it go. Why have we stopped, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Sarah said. \"He seems to be checking something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Bolden turned and looked back at them. He didn\u0027t move. He just stood there and stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we get out?\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio crackled and they heard \"is Weddell CM to401. Are you there, Dr. Kenner? Weddell CM toKenner. Can you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Sarah said, smiling. \"I think we finally got something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio hissed and sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"just found Jimmy Bolden unconscious inmaintenance room. We don\u0027t know who isout there withbut it\u0027s not\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit,\" Evans said, staring at the man in front of them. \"That guy\u0027s not Bolden? Who is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but he\u0027s blocking the way,\" Sarah said. \"And he\u0027s waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud crack! from beneath them. Inside the cab, the sound echoed like a gunshot. Their vehicle shifted slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw this,\" Sarah said. \"We\u0027re getting out of here, even if I have to ram the bastard.\" She put the snowtrack in gear, and started to back away from the vehicle in front of them. She shifted, starting the snowtrack forward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother crack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go!\" Evans said. \"Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack! Crack! Their vehicle lurched beneath them, tilted sideways at an angle. Evans looked out at the guy pretending to be Bolden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the ice,\" Sarah said. \"He\u0027s waiting for our weight to break through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ram him!\" Evans said, pointing ahead. The bastard was making some hand gesture to them. It took him a moment for Evans to understand what it meant. Then he got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was waving goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah stomped on the accelerator and the engine rumbled forward, but in the next moment the ground gave way completely beneath them, and their vehicle nosed down. Evans saw the blue-ice wall of a crevasse. Then the vehicle began to tumble forward, and they were encased for an instant in a world of eerie blue before they plunged onward into the blackness below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHEAR ZONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:51 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah opened her eyes and saw a huge blue starburst, streaks radiating outward in all directions. Her forehead was icy cold, and she had terrible pain in her neck. Tentatively, she shifted her body, checking each of her limbs. They hurt, but she could move all of them except her right leg, which was pinned under something. She coughed and paused, taking stock. She was lying on her side, her face shoved up against the windshield, which she had shattered with her forehead. Her eyes were just inches from the fractured glass. She eased away, and slowly looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark, a kind of twilight. Faint light coming from somewhere to her left. But she could see that the whole cab of the snowtrack was lying on its side, the treads up against the ice wall. They must have landed on a ledge of some kind. She looked upwardthe mouth of the crevasse was surprisingly close, maybe thirty or forty yards above her. It was near enough to give her a burst of encouragement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext she looked down, trying to see Evans. But it was dark everywhere beneath her. She couldn\u0027t see him at all. Her eyes slowly adjusted. She gasped. She saw her true situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowtrack had tumbled into the narrowing crevasse, and wedged itself sideways within the crevasse walls. The treads were against one wall, the roof of the cab against the other, and the cab itself was suspended over the inky downward gash. The door on Evans\u0027s side hung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans was not in the cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had fallen out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened. There was nothing. No sound or movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the realization hit her: She was alone down there. A hundred feet down in a freezing crevasse, in the middle of a trackless ice field, far off the road, miles from anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she realized, with a chill, that this was going to be her tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoldenor whoever he washad planned it very well, Sarah thought. He had taken their transponder. He could drive a few miles, drop it down the deepest crevasse he could find, and then go back to the base. When the rescue parties set out, they would head for the transponder. It would be nowhere near where she was. The party might search for days in a deep crevasse before giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if they widened the search? They still wouldn\u0027t find the snowtrack. Even though it was only about forty yards below the surface, it might as well be four hundred yards below. It was too deep to be seen by a passing helicopter, or even a vehicle as it drove by. Not that any vehicle would. They would think the snowtrack had gone off the marked road, and they would search along the edge of the road. Not way out here, in the middle of the ice field. The road was seventeen miles long. They would spend days searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Sarah thought. They would never find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even if she could get herself to the surface, what then? She had no compass, no map, no GPS. No radioit lay smashed beneath her knee. She didn\u0027t even know in what direction Weddell Station might be from her present location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she thought, she had a bright red parka that would be visible from a distance, and she had supplies, food, equipmentall the equipment that guy had talked about, before they set out. What was it, exactly? She vaguely remembered something about climbing supplies. Crampons and ropes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah bent down, managed to free herself from a toolbox that had pinned her foot to the floor, and then crawled to the rear of the cab, balancing carefully to avoid the gaping, wide-open door beneath her. In the perpetual twilight of the crevasse, she saw the supply locker. It was crumpled slightly from the impact, and she couldn\u0027t get it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to the toolbox, opened it, took out a hammer and a screwdriver, and spent the better part of the next half hour trying to pry the locker open. At last, with a metallic screech, the door swung wide. She peered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe locker was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo food, no water, no climbing supplies. No space blankets, no heaters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah took a deep breath, let it out slowly. She remained calm, refusing to panic. She considered her options. Without ropes and crampons, she could not get to the surface. What could she use instead? She had a toolbox. Could she use the screwdriver as an ice axe? Probably too small. Perhaps she could disassemble the gearshift and make an ice axe out of the parts. Or perhaps she could take apart some of the tread and find parts to use. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-24.html","bookId":1706,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM"}
