Moreover, this was only borrowing. Although an Empyrean was an existence that had experienced heavenly tribulation and could stand equal to the Heavenly Dao, the truth was that the area on which they stood was a tiny, nearly infinitesimal part. Moreover, that was only the transcendent divine might that they established.

Even though Clearshadow and Dreampearl were gifted daughters of heaven, when they were trying to complete the third step of a second grade divine runic symbol, they still had to be extremely cautious and proceed with absolute care.

Clearshadow and Dreampearl were somewhat nervous. As for Qin Yi, he was calm and composed. A divine runic pen jumped into his hands, spinning above his fingertips as if it had a mind of its own.

From the materials they had gathered, one could guess what rune they had decided to draw up.

This divine runic symbol was essentially useless and mostly a waste of resources to make. But, divine runic masters still held this symbol in high esteem because turning ‘stone to gold’ was something that only the divine runic arts could accomplish. Without the divine runic arts, even an Empyrean would be helpless in this matter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThus, although this was a worthless symbol, it was a divine runic symbol that put the charm of the divine runic arts on full display!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnd as for the reason that Clearshadow and Dreampearl had chosen Touch of Gold, that was because this divine runic symbol was considered relatively easy and their chances of succeeding would be somewhat higher.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs for Qin Yi, he had chosen Heart of the Medicine Furnace.

This was also a divine runic symbol for pills.

Or does he know he can’t pass so he’s just putting on an act?” Qin Yi glanced at Lin Ming, a playful light in his eyes.

This sort of divine runic symbol was one that many well-known senior divine runic masters didn’t choose when they went through their second grade divine runic master examination.

I originally thought that this boy’s divine runic arts talent was worse than that of Clearshadow and Dreampearl. In the first grade examination I was unable to see just how skilled he was, but after learning of his skeletal age I don’t dare to evaluate him yet. He is simply a monstrous genius!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t bother with everyone that was paying attention to him. He continued on at his slow and unhurried pace, processing the materials in a uniform manner. His movements were steady without any flaws to them, and the divine runic pen in his hands was like an iron chain spanning a raging river, simply unshakeable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe reason Lin Ming chose the Pill Resting Symbol was because this divine runic symbol was worth a considerable amount of money and he would be able to sell it after he drew it up. Currently, Lin Ming’s net worth could withstand this sort of loss, but in a situation where he only spent money and didn’t earn any, he couldn’t continue like this forever. Sooner or later he would have to figure out some way to recoup his expenses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA divine runic symbol like Touch of Gold was formed from expensive materials and couldn’t even be sold for a tiny bit of money.

Instead, he crossed his hands behind his back and started observing everyone else, especially Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Qin Yi saw Lin Ming’s steady technique, he was a bit astonished.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This boy, I didn’t think his skill level was much during the first grade divine runic master examination; who knew he would have some modicum of skill. However, the speed and expertise of his drawing skill is still lacking compared to my own. Moreover, the key to completing a second grade divine runic symbol is the third and final step. In this aspect, Touch of Gold is far more simple, but you decided to choose the much more difficult Pill Resting Symbol. I want to see just how you complete the third step… of course, the premise of that is if you can last until the third step…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eQin Yi faintly smiled and began his own work.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf Qin Yi wanted to watch Lin Ming’s ‘third step’ then he would have to finish drawing up his divine runic symbol before Lin Ming started on the third step.

The white-robed Elder also nodded in acknowledgement. Even for a second grade divine runic symbol, Qin Yi was able to maintain such a smooth drawing technique like passing clouds and flowing rivers. It wouldn’t be difficult for Qin Yi to form the main body of the divine runic symbol. The crux of the examination, the most difficult part, would be the final, third step. Everything would depend on how Qin Yi fused the Asura Road’s Heavenly Dao into the divine runic symbol.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Divine Void Divine Kingdom’s third step has always been superior to ours.
