It wasn\u0027t that the virus had a smell to it, but it was a deadly atmosphere that inspired terror in living things. That super virus slowly spread through the whole city. It wasn\u0027t just the virus’ corruption that posed a threat, but the mutated zombies as well. Any team below a certain level that had the misfortune of encountering them would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eTeam Africa was lucky. They just happened to be above the threshold of this ‘certain level’. They could still eliminate mutated zombies when they encountered them. Unfortunately, their power wasn\u0027t at the level where they could disregard the mutated zombies or the super virus. This power couldn\u0027t be faked. Reaching the fourth stage would grant immunity to the virus. If it wasn\u0027t reached, death would doubtlessly follow. There was no middle ground. There was no such thing as third stages being able to get off with just a serious case of illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eWhen team Africa reached the Umbrella Corporation\u0027s building, team China was still a distance away. Due to some unknown interference, psyche force scans were weakened upon entering the building. It was limited to a ten metre range. Such a small range wouldn\u0027t let them scan the surroundings and secure the team’s safety, let alone contact team China. Overall, a psyche force user wasn\u0027t as useful as a melee combatant in this building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“How troublesome. Psyche force scanning isn\u0027t usable in this building? God’s restrictions really are strange.” One of their members smiled bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eNeos, however, was frowning. “It’s not that simple. Restrictions tell us that we’ve come to the right place. We do indeed need to come to this building to find clues for the Hive and Seventh Underground Laboratory. Similarly, if this is an important turning point for information, there must be a high difficulty here. Perhaps… this building may have monsters that can wipe our team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Like that terrifying monster we saw outside the building?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eUpon mention of these terrifying monsters, everyone felt as if a knife was stabbing into heart, repeatedly twisting and tearing it apart. This feeling was no longer fear, but a sort of despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThere was especially the scene of being mutated alive that was captured when psyche force scanned a human being infected by the virus. Everyone secretly made the decision to suicide as soon as they were infected. Although God’s Realm was the realm of horror movies, even non-scientific horror movies of ghosts and monsters were to be honest, no longer that scary with the gradually increase in strength of the teams and experiencing so much in so little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eBut the terror that was outside the building was different. That virus could mutate the body while it was still alive, and wouldn\u0027t wait for you to die before it began the mutation. The pain was impossible to imagine. However, the pain in the spectators’ hearts was even greater than the mutatee. They all recalled the words the veterans then had told them when they first entered the realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“If you’re despairing or lack the courage to live on, then kill yourself. That’s better than dying by those monsters or ghosts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThis was actually similar to the words Jie had said to Zheng and the rest before. It was directed towards those who despaired deeply at the horror movies. To ordinary people who hadn’t grown, God’s Realm was a place that was akin to hell. Now… these veterans who had already matured were once again experiencing that emotion from the very beginning. However, this feeling wasn’t as sweet as a first love, but instead the terror of the first ever nightmare you remember having.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eNeos rubbed his forehead gently. There was a visible crack there that slowly began to open, as if an eye was appearing on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Let’s go. The senses of my Three Eyed Race are more practical than psyche force here. I’ll replace the psyche force user for now. It’ll be good if the danger in this building doesn’t appear.” Neos sighed as he turned to walked through the building’s emergency passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(Team China. The information will definitely be passed onto you if I die. This isn’t just a matter for God’s Realm any longer, but the real world as well. If you fail, the world will end. How ironic. I’ll actually have such a heroic death. God must be going blind.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eNeos thought internally as he walked. The more he thought about it the more ironic he found it. By the end of it, he was laughing out loud. Before the laugh ended, a gloomy voice resounded out from above. “You’re laughing so happily. Did you see hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Correct. I saw hell. Anyone who blocks my path will sink in that hell, like you two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eIn the emergency passageway, two or three floors from team Africa, two man were standing there coldly smiling. One of them was wearing long black robes that even covered his face. The other man was covered in muscles, and was carrying a peculiarly styled gun. The two were standing in the passageway, one in front and one behind. One look was enough to tell they didn’t bear any kind intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“I’m curious. How did you all team Celestial know we’ll be here? Or to be more accurate, how did you all know we entered the ruins after you all? You’re stopping and hunting us down now. Don\u0027t tell me… You didn\u0027t only obtain the Tree of Life in the ruins? Was there something else?” Neos laughed as he walked towards the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“And \u003ci style\u003d\"font-style: italic\"\u003ewho\u003c/i\u003e exactly told you we were from team Celestial?” The two upstairs exchanged a smile, before the black robed man proceeded to laugh coldly as he asked with a gloomy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eWhen the words flowed out, Neos was lost in thought. Then, he was immediately enlightened. “Yes, you’re not from team Celestial… Team Celestial wouldn’t deploy anyone. They would surely die if they encounter team China or team Devil. Chasing me down would also end up verifying what I want to tell team China and make those two teams have no alternative but to fight team Celestial. So… team Devil?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe two froze slightly. Then, they began to chuckle. “You really do have some capabilities. No wonder Xuan said you’ll definitely give the information to team China. It won’t do keeping you around… So, die!” He raised the gun and began to fire downwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe gun was strangely shaped. The barrel had a long container filled with liquid attached to it, giving it the appearance of a child’s water gun. However, there naturally wasn’t any way a member of team Devil would be carrying a water gun. The liquid was originally deep blue, only to turn deep red upon the man pulling the trigger. At the same time, light appeared at the muzzle like a laser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eNeos and the rest were only able to retreat several steps in time as a ball of light fell from above, Although the gap between the floors prevented the shot from landing directly on their heads, the ball of light still exploded upon contact with the ground. The enormous force was like an small high-powered explosive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eA faint layer of light appeared on a majority of team Africa. A few of the newbies who lacked this light were immediately blown to bits in the explosion. The power of the explosion was doubtless in this narrow passageway. All of the veterans had defensive equipment, and so were able to block this round of explosions. Neos roared as he retreated, while the rest all scattered back to the lower floors through the emergency passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“That weapon is only exchangeable with rank CC rewards!” Someone shouted as soon as they left the emergency passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe most important thing for veterans after obtaining points and ranked rewards was to exchange enhancements or abilities that suited them, high tech weapons included within. Using the limited points and ranked rewards to build the most suitable and powerful combat power that also made it easier to survive was the most important thing for them. Thus, most veterans were very familiar with all the low grade weapons and enhancements God offered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-chapter-23-11-3\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-23-chapter-12-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-23-chapter-12-1","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
