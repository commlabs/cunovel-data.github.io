It\u0027s called Hesiod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel as it fell into an orbit trailing far, far behind the gas giant, but slowly catching up to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There we go,\" Keyes said, upping the magnification on the view ahead of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asteroids?\" Zheng said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trojan asteroids,\" Keyes said. \"Most gas giants have asteroids sitting just ahead and behind their orbit in stable L4 and L5 positions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes a good hideout,\" Rai Li spoke up from weapons. \"The rebels at Eridani used the asteroid belt there and it made it hard to hunt them down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel slowed as it slipped into the cloud of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something wrong, Keyes thought. Dirtsiders heard the term \"asteroid field\" and thought of a large collection of rocks floating near each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that asteroids lay millions of miles from each other. A slow-moving ship could thread through them easily enough on their way through a system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this collection of asteroids looked just like a layperson\u0027s idea of an asteroid field. Hundreds of asteroids had been moved within a mile of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes magnified the image even more, putting it up on a wall screen the whole bridge could look at. The hundreds of irregularly shaped rocks jumped into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like some of them are built up,\" Dante Kirtley said. \"Plus, I\u0027m starting to get a lot of direct-line comms chatter. They\u0027re trying to keep it focused and quiet, but I\u0027m hearing it. Looks like we got ourselves an Insurrectionist hiding hole. And behind Covenant lines, no less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something glinted between them. Keyes upped the magnification even further, and everyone on the bridge gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glints were long, silver lines. As Keyes jumped the magnification up again, the gossamer lines resolved themselves into tubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all connected,\" Li said. \"With docking tubes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If each of those asteroids is fully inhabited, this isn\u0027t just an Insurrectionist hiding hole,\" Zheng said. \"It\u0027s a floating metropolis ... behind enemy lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey coasted in closer, staring at the spectacle of an asteroid field towed in closer, connected together, and hollowed out. Ships moved in between the rocks, and occasionally a burst of flame from a guidance rocket adjusted an asteroid, presumably so that it didn\u0027t break one of the tubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Freeze that,\" Li suddenly snapped. Keyes stopped the drift on the image. \"Zoom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw it too, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a Jackal ship?\" Kirtley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Jackal,\" Li confirmed. She tapped her console and put a window up next to their live image of a Jackal ship taken from the combat camera of a Navy ship. Unlike the usual Covenant-made ships, the Jackal-made ships looked like last-minute scrap yard projects -- girders, rockets, and capsules haphazardly joined together around a core unit. These ships were not made to even kiss an atmosphere, but remain in space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng cracked his knuckles and stared at the screen. \"Bring the crew up to ready, ops. Weapons, unlock missiles and arm a nuke. Comms, make sure you\u0027re scanning and getting everything that\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi, Kirtley, Keyes, and Campbell got to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant Campbell, set up preparations to destroy our navigation charts, as per the Cole Protocol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell paused, considered something, and then spoke up. \"Sir, does it make sense? The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel obviously has charts, and I\u0027d bet other ships in this ... complex have charts as well. We\u0027re not making it any harder for Covenant here to find charts, are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng looked at the screen. \"You\u0027re right, Lieutenant. That thing out there, that\u0027s just one giant Cole Protocol violation, isn\u0027t it? But orders are orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady the purge.

But if things get hairy, be ready to get us the hell out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, sir,\" Keyes responded. Then he spotted movement. \"They have patrols, it looks like. Moving around the perimeter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see how stealthy this frigate really is, Keyes.\" Zheng leaned forward in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night moved closer to the tangle of docking tubes, asteroids, ships, dust, and debris trailing the massive orb of Hesiod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter TWENTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePINEAPPLE HABITAT, THE RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel \u0027Vadamee and his bridge crew sat on the far end of a large cell. It was a crude thing: a hole dug out of the rocky interior wall of a hollowed out asteroid, with bars of metal over the front, some of which were hinged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel had seen medieval keeps with similarly built jails back on Sanghelios. In museums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d woken up with a horrific headache pounding the side of his temple where he\u0027d struck the bulkhead. Not an honorable battle wound, or a way to end a fight, Thel thought miserably as he looked out through the bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kig-Yar had combed the remains of the ship, carrion sniffers that they were, and found the bridge crew alive. The rest of the crew had fought to the death, destroying the ship in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel sincerely wished they\u0027d just left him for dead on his destroyed ship. But the Kig-Yar had some plan in mind for them, using the Sangheili as hostages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJora crept his way over. \"I am beyond shame, my shipmaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel had been told Jora rushed the Kig-Yar with no weapon, and they\u0027d shot him several times in the leg. Now Jora was dragging the useless limb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind him on the cell floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have snapped one of the legs off those useless cots made for humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed it to Thel, who tested the sharp end with a finger. Jora had worked hard to get the long piece of metal sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Jora begged. \"I have no honor left. I am crippled. I cannot face my keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Sangheili masters found out that they\u0027d been captured by a lesser race like the Kig-Yar, or that they\u0027d failed so horribly in a holy mission handed to them directly by a Hierarch, there would be dire consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJora\u0027s entire bloodline could be killed off. They\u0027d hunt down his nephews and behead them. The genetic proclivities of failures, the planetary heads of Sangheilios thought, could not be allowed to continue on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if Jora did the right thing, and killed himself before the Kig-Yar could get any use out of him, or further sully his name and by extension, his line ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewell, his keep might fall in stature, but at least the line could try to struggle back up from its loss of honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Jora whispered. \"You have been like a cousin to me. Please do me one last favor. I have not the strength to do it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come and kneel,\" Thel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other zealots in the cell faced away. It was embarrassing to see that Jora could not even dispatch himself, but needed the hand of another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Thel remembered how Jora had thrown himself against the Kig-Yar. That had to count for something, he thought, as he stepped behind Jora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May the Great Journey await you, may your enemies writhe in hell, and your line continue forward, and gain honor,\" Thel said to his boldest fighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he slammed the spike into the back of Jora\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJora slowly toppled forward with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May your scattered body go,\" Veer murmured, turning back around, \"beyond the limits of your mind....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beyond the limits of our worlds,\" Saal said the next line of the death benediction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the places our ancestors dream and sang of,\" Zhar sang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Prophets speak of,\" Thel finished.

You know this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" Zhar said. Thel could see his tactical mind working. This was good. Set Zhar on a problem and he was like a warrior -- he\u0027d tussle with it to his last breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaal laughed. \"The Kig-Yar are idiots who pay no attention to us.

That is a Kig-Yar game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhar turned to him. \"And that is how we will destroy them. They are too far away to find this out so quickly.

This all looks like it was recently welded together on short notice to contain us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel snorted in appreciation. \"Roll Jora\u0027s body onto a cot and cover it.
