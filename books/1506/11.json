the 12 year old Maetel held it up, it looked like a claymore. \u0026nbsp;The sword looked enormous in her hands. \u0026nbsp;Naturally, she couldn’t afford to hold the shield alongside the

slow her down if the heavy shield was strapped to her back. \u0026nbsp;It would be better for her to preserve her speed, so she could evade the enemy’s attack. \u0026nbsp;Still, it was a waste to just

he went through the Dungeon, and he had infused Mana to strengthen them. \u0026nbsp;He created a hole on each side of the shield, and he threaded the strip of leather through the holes. \u0026nbsp;One end of the strap was brought over his left shoulder and the other end was brought underneath his right armpit. \u0026nbsp;He tied it off. \u0026nbsp;Artpe looked like a
