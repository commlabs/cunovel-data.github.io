Nobody was to be alone. That done, Androl listened to Welyn’s boasting, and noticed Lind picking her way through the crowd toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLind Taglien was a short, dark-haired woman; her dress was covered in lovely embroidery. She had always seemed to him a model of what the Black Tower could be. Civilized. Educated. Important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen made way for her; they knew not to spill their drinks or start fights in her inn. Lind’s anger was not something a wise man ever wanted to know. It was a good thing she ran the place so tightly. In a city full of male channelers, a simple tavern brawl could potentially go very, very wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this bother you as much as it does me?\" Lind asked softly as she stepped up beside him. \"Wasn’t he the one who, just a few weeks back, was talking about how Taim should be tried and executed for some of the things he’d done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol didn’t reply. What could he say? That he suspected that the man they’d known as Welyn was dead? That the entire Black Tower would soon be nothing but these monsters with the wrong eyes, the false smiles, the dead souls?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t believe him about Logain\", Lind said. \"Something’s going on here, Androl. I’m going to have Frask follow him tonight, see where he—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\", Androl said. \"No. Don’t\". Frask was her husband, a man who had been hired to help Henre Haslin teach swordsmanship in the Black Tower. Taim thought that swordfighting was useless for Asha’man, but the Lord Dragon had insisted that the men be taught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed him. \"You’re not saying you believe—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m saying that were in great danger right now, Lind, and I don’t want Frask making it worse. Do me a favor. Take note of what else Welyn says tonight. Maybe some of it will be useful for me to know\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right\", she said, sounding skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol nodded toward Nalaam and Canler, who rose and headed over. Rain beat against the rooftop and the porch outside. Welyn kept right on talking, and the men were listening. Yes, it was incredible that he’d swapped sides so quickly, and that would make some suspicious. But many people respected him, and the way he was off just slightly wasn’t noticeable unless you knew him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lind\", Androl said as she started to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You . . . lock this place up tightly tonight. Then maybe you and Frask should find your way into the cellar with some supplies, all right? You have a sturdy cellar door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\", she said. \"For all the good it will do\". It wouldn’t matter how thick a door was if someone with the One Power came looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNalaam and Canler reached them, and Androl turned to go, only to run directly into a man standing in the doorway behind him, someone he hadn’t heard approach. Rain dripped from his Asha’man coat, with the Sword and the Dragon on the high collar. Atal Mishraile had been one of Taim’s from the start. Fie didn’t have the hollow eyes; his evil was all his own. Tall, with long golden hair, he had a smile that never seemed to reach his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePevara jumped when she saw him, and Nalaam cursed, seizing the One Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, now\", a voice said. \"No need for strife\". Mezar stepped in from the rain beside Mishraile. The short Domani man had graying hair and an air of wisdom to him, despite his transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol met Mezar’s eyes, and it was like looking into a deep cavern. A place where light had never shone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Androl\", Mezar said, putting a hand on Mishraile’s shoulder, as if the two had been friends for a long time. \"Why is it that Goodwoman Lind would need to fear, and shut herself in her cellar? Surely the Black Tower is as safe a place as there is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t trust a dark night full of storms\", Androl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps that is wise\", Mezar replied. \"Yet you go out into it. Why not stay where it is warm? Nalaam, I should like to hear one of your stories. Perhaps you could tell me of the time your father and you visited Shara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s not that good a story\", Nalaam said. \"I don’t know if I remember it that well\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMezar laughed, and Androl heard Welyn stand up behind him. \"Ah, there you are! I was telling them you’d talk about defenses in Arafel\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come listen\", Mezar said. \"This will be important for the Last Battle\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I will return\", Androl said, voice cool. \"Once my other work is done\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two stared at one another. To the side, Nalaam still held the One Power. He was as strong as Mezar, but would never be able to face both him and Mishraile—particularly not in a room crammed with people who would probably take the side of the two full Asha’man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don’t waste your time with the pageboy, Welyn\", Coteren said from behind. Mishraile stepped aside to make room for this third newcomer. The bulky, beady-eyed man pressed a hand against Androl’s chest and shoved him aside as he passed. \"Oh, wait. You can’t play pageboy anymore, can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol entered the void and seized the Source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows immediately started moving in the room. Lengthening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren’t enough lights! Why didn’t they light more lamps? The darkness invited those shadows in, and he could see them. These were real, each one a tendril of blackness, reaching for him. To pull him into them, to destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Light. I\u0027m mad. I\u0027m mad. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe void shattered, and the shadows—thankfully—retreated. He found himself shaking, pulling back against the wall, panting. Pevara watched him with an expressionless face, but he could feel her concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, by the way\", Coteren said. He was one of Taim’s most influential toadies. \"Have you heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard what?\" Androl managed to force out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’ve been demoted, pageboy\", Coteren said, pointing toward the sword pin. \"Taim’s orders. As of today. Back to soldier you go, Androl\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes\", Welyn called from the center of the room. \"I’m sorry I forgot to mention it. It has been cleared with the Lord Dragon, I’m afraid. You never should have been promoted, Androl. Sorry\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol reached to his neck, to the pin there. It shouldn’t matter to him; what did it really mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it did matter. He’d spent his entire life searching. He’d apprenticed to a dozen different professions. He’d fought in revolts, sailed two seas. All the while searching, searching for something he hadn\u0026amp;rsq \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-37.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
