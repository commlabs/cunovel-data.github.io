I will leave soon after. Pegasus runs better at night, and I must tell the Conclave of Gemma’s observations,” Angelique said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you think it’s true?” Gemma asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think Stil is being targeted for his unique skills?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Normally, one would not think of Stil as being a threat. He hasn’t the fire power of some other mages. But if one is looking at widespread war that will cause countries to form an alliance…Stil would have a larger impact than any single enchanter,” Angelique said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” Gemma said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When Angelique and I go face the rider, Gemma, I ask that you remain at camp,” Stil piped in. “It’s going to be a battle, and I fear the rider would attack you,” he said, reaching over Pricker Patch’s neck to smooth Gemma’s wavy hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma fixed her hair when Stil finished. “Of course,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You agree so easily?” Angelique asked as her mount pinned its ears and shook its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Naturally,” Gemma said. “My survival instincts are quite strong, and I know I have few—or perhaps even no—skills of combat. It would be safer for me to remain as far away as possible. Besides, someone must see that Pricker Patch and…,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pegasus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pricker Patch and Pegasus are fed and watered,” Gemma said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. And thank you,” Stil said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelique laughed. “I like her, Stil. You’ve chosen well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Stil glowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma sighed loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although the lady does not seem joyous,” Angelique added, struggling with her mount, who pranced with impatience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will wear her down,” Stil said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma raised her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few more minutes of travel—when it was barely light enough to still see—Stil called a halt. “We’ll pitch the tent here,” Stil said. “Even after Angelique clears the rider off, I’m not keen to sleep in a realm outside the Snow Queen’s protection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where will you go tomorrow?” Angelique asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Stil admitted, unpacking the tent from Pricker Patch’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suggest you go to Loire and seek out Prince Severin and Princess Elle,” Angelique said. “Though Severin’s curse is broken, I feel out of all the royals in the continent, he has the best understanding of what we are up against.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I should offer my services to him,” Stil said as he started piecing the tent together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelique nodded. “He and Princess Elle recently hosted Crown Prince Cristoph and Princess Cinderella—although by now she is almost Queen Cinderella—of Erlauf. I believe he meant to speak to them about their goblin infestation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, he’s starting to organize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then as long as Gemma has no objections, I think we will call upon the Price and Princess,” Stil said, looking to Gemma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do they live in Noyers?” Gemma asked, naming the capital of Loire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. They live in a chateau that is quite close, though, since the roads have been repaired,” Angelique said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma nodded. “I would like to travel to Loire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil finished pitching the tent and studied her with narrowed eyes. “You plan to abandon me for Noyers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma pressed her lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will be able to find work there, but you will be safer with me,” Stil said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This I doubt so long as you are sought out by darkness,” Gemma said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelique laughed as she slid from her mount’s back. “She has you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I will be going to see Prince Severin and Princess Elle. She sets all the fashions for Loire. Don’t you want to see her?” Stil tempted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma softened her stance as she considered the idea. As much as Gemma would love to see Princess Elle, there was also the business of getting a glimpse of Prince Severin. Lady Linnea will throttle me if I pass on an opportunity to meet one of her military heroes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think about it. In the meantime, Angelique and I must leave to get rid of my stalker. Go inside and warm up before you bother with Pricker Patch. He can wait to have his dinner,” Stil said, sliding one arm around Gemma’s waist to force her closer to him. He used his free hand to take one of Gemma’s mittened hands and placed it on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma exhaled loudly to voice her lack of satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you can wear her down before you both die of old age,” Angelique said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil scowled. “Thank you for the show of support, Angelique,” he said before smiling at Gemma. “Be careful,” he said before kissing her on the center of her hair-band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, he was gone, taking his heat with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How on earth do you stay warm in that dress?” Stil asked as Angelique took a white muff from the single bag she had slung over her mount’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s spelled. Master Evariste got it for me,” Angelique said as they started out for the border.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm. Spared no expense for his apprentice, did he?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rumpelstiltskin-timeless-fairy-tales-4/page-63.html","bookId":1805,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM"}
