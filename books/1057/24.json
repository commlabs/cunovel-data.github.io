At Vespers, while the clear, boyish voicesintoned the long-drawn canticles, Jean would be gazing at somewoman\u0027s face half seen in the dusk of the galleries where thepupils\u0027 mothers and sisters knelt during the office, their haughtyair contradicting the humble attitude. At the sound of the _Avemaris stella_, the lowly bookbinder\u0027s son would lift his eyesto these ladies of high degree, the plainest of whom feels herselfa jewel of price and cherishes a natural and unaffected pride ofbirth.

All that elementin religion which gives to love the fascination of forbiddenfruit appealed powerfully to his imagination. Unbeliever thoughhe was, he loved the Magdalen\u0027s God and savoured the creed thathas bestowed on lovers one amorous bliss the more--the blissof losing their immortal souls.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3037/83926.html","bookId":1057,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 11:15:10 PM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 11:15:10 PM"}
