I begin to think that the prize-package business will soon be played out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s too many that\u0027ll go into it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here Paul related his experience of the morning, explaining how it was that Teddy had managed to distance him in the competition.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can\u0027t you do the same, Paul?” asked Jimmy. “Mother\u0027s got a gold dollar she could lend you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That might do,” said Paul; “but I don\u0027t know any boy I could trust to draw it except you, and some of them would know we were brothers.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think, Paul, that would be dishonest,” said Mrs. Hoffman. “I would rather make less, if I were you, and do it honestly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Maybe you\u0027re right, mother. I\u0027ll try it again this afternoon, keeping as far away from Teddy as I can. If I find I can\u0027t make it go, I\u0027ll try some other business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jimmy, have you shown Paul your drawing?” said his mother.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here it is, Paul,” said Jimmy, producing his drawing-book, from which he had copied a simple design of a rustic cottage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, that\u0027s capital, Jimmy,” said Paul, in real surprise. “I had no idea you would succeed so well.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you really think so, Paul?” asked the little boy, much pleased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I really do. How long did it take you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Only a short time—not more than half an hour, I should think,” said Mrs. Hoffman. “I think Jimmy succeeded very well.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027ll make a great artist some time, Jimmy,” said Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish I could,” said the little boy. “I should like to earn some money, so that you and mother need not work so hard.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hard work agrees with me. I\u0027m tough,” said Paul. “But when we get to be men, Jimmy, we\u0027ll make so much money that mother needn\u0027t work at all. She shall sit in the parlor all day, dressed in silk, with nothing to do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t think I would enjoy that,” said Mrs. Hoffman, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you be in the candy business, then, Paul?” said Jimmy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, Jimmy. It would never do for the brother of a great artist to be selling candy round the streets. I hope I shall have something better to do than that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sit down to dinner, Paul,” said his mother. “It\u0027s all ready.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The dinner was not a luxurious one. There was a small plate of cold meat, some potatoes, and bread and butter; but Mrs. Hoffman felt glad to be able to provide even that, and Paul, who had the hearty appetite of a growing boy, did full justice to the fare. They had scarcely finished, when a knock was heard at the door. Paul, answering the summons, admitted a stout, pleasant-looking Irishwoman.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The top of the mornin\u0027 to ye, Mrs. Donovan,” said Paul, bowing ceremoniously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, ye\u0027ll be afther havin\u0027 your joke, Paul,” said Mrs. Donovan, good-naturedly. “And how is your health, mum, the day?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am well, thank you, Mrs. Donovan,” said Mrs. Hoffman. “Sit down to the table, won\u0027t you? We\u0027re just through dinner, but there\u0027s something left.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, mum, I\u0027ve jist taken dinner. I was goin\u0027 to wash this afternoon, and I thought maybe you\u0027d have some little pieces I could wash jist as well as not.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, Mrs. Donovan, you are very kind; but you must have enough work of your own to do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m stout and strong, mum, and hard work agrees with me; but you\u0027re a rale lady, and ain\u0027t used to it. It\u0027s only a thrifle, but if you want to pay me, you could do a bit of sewin\u0027 for me. I ain\u0027t very good with the needle. My fingers is too coarse, belike.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, Mrs. Donovan; on those terms I will agree to your kind offer. Washing is a little hard for me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Hoffman collected a few pieces, and, wrapping them up in a handkerchief, handed them to her guest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And now what have you been doin\u0027, Jimmy darlint?” said Mrs. Donovan, turning her broad, good-humored face toward the younger boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ve been drawing a picture,” said Jimmy. “Would you like to see it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, isn\u0027t that illigant?” exclaimed Mrs. Donovan, admiringly, taking the picture and gazing at it with rapt admiration. “Who showed you how to do it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Paul bought me a book, and I copied it out of that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027re a rale genius. Maybe you\u0027ll make pictures some time like them we have in the church, of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints. Do you think you could draw me, now?” she asked, with curiosity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I haven\u0027t got a piece of paper big enough,” said Jimmy, slyly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, it\u0027s pokin\u0027 fun at me, ye are,” said Mrs. Donovan, good-humoredly. “Just like my Pat; he run into the room yesterday sayin\u0027, \u0027Mother, there\u0027s great news. Barnum\u0027s fat woman is dead, and he\u0027s comin\u0027 afther you this afternoon. He\u0027ll pay you ten dollars a week and board.\u0027 \u0027Whist, ye spalpeen!\u0027 said I; \u0027is it makin\u0027 fun of your poor mother, ye are?\u0027 but I couldn\u0027t help laughing at the impertinence of the boy. But I must be goin\u0027.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you for your kind offer, Mrs. Donovan. Jimmy shall go to your room for the sewing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s no hurry about that,” said Mrs. Donovan. “I\u0027ll jist bring it in meself when it\u0027s ready.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “She is very kind,” said Mrs. Hoffman, when Bridget Donovan had gone. “I shall be glad to have her wash. I am apt to feel weak after it. What are you going to do this afternoon, Paul?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll try to sell out the rest of my stock of packages. Perhaps I shan\u0027t succeed, but I\u0027ll do my best. Shall you have another picture to show me when I come back tonight, Jimmy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, Paul; I love to draw. I\u0027m going to try this castle.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s rather hard, isn\u0027t it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can do it,” said Jimmy, confidently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul left the room with his basket on his arm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was drawn by curiosity to the spot where he had met with his first success, as well as his first failure—the front of the post office. Here he became witness to an unexpectedly lively scene; in other words, a fight, in which Teddy O\u0027Brien and his confederate, Mike, were the contestants. To explain the cause of the quarrel, it must be stated that it related to a division of the spoils.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Teddy had sold out his last package, seventy-five in number. For these he had received five cents apiece, making in all three dollars and seventy-five cents, of which all but a dollar and seventy-five cents, representing the value of the prizes and the original cost of the packages and their contents, was profit. Now, according to the arrangement entered into between him and Mike, the latter, for his services, was to receive one cent on every package sold. This, however, seemed to Teddy too much to pay, so, when the time of reckoning came, he stoutly asseverated that there were but sixty packages.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That don\u0027t go down,” said Mike, indignantly; “it\u0027s nearer a hundred.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s only sixty. You\u0027ve got the fifty cents, and I\u0027ll give you ten more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You must give me the whole sixty, then,” said Mike, changing his ground. “I drawed the fifty as a prize.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Teddy was struck with astonishment at the impudence of this assumption.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It wasn\u0027t no prize,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, it was,” said Mike. “You said so yourself. Didn\u0027t he, Jim?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jim, who was also a confederate, but had agreed to accept twenty-five cents in full for services rendered, promptly answered:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shure, Mike\u0027s right. It was a prize he drew.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You want to chate me!” said Teddy, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What have you been doin\u0027 all the mornin\u0027?” demanded Mike. “You\u0027re the chap to talk about chatin\u0027, ain\u0027t you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll give you twenty-five cents,” said Teddy, “and that\u0027s all I will give you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you\u0027ve got to fight,” said Mike, squaring off.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, you\u0027ve got to fight!” chimed in Jim, who thought he saw a chance for more money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Teddy looked at his two enemies, each of whom was probably more than a match for himself, and was not long in deciding that his best course was to avoid a fight by running. Accordingly, he tucked all the money into his pocket, and, turning incontinently, fled down Liberty street, closely pursued by his late confederates. Paul came up just in time to hear the termination of the dispute and watch the flight of his late business rival.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I guess Teddy won\u0027t go into the business again,” he reflected. “I may as well take my old stand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Accordingly he once more installed himself on the post office steps, and began to cry, “Prize packages. Only five cents!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Having no competitor now to interfere with his trade, he met with fair success, and by four o\u0027clock was able to start for home with his empty basket, having disposed of all his stock in trade.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His profits, though not so great as the day before, amounted to a dollar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I could only make a dollar every day,” thought Paul, “I would be satisfied.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2994/82596.html","bookId":318,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:58:45 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:58:45 AM"}
