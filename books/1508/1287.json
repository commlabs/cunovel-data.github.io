With several hundred million admission tickets, this amount was divided amongst the 100-200 Empyrean Heavenly Palaces, 3000 great worlds, and countless medium worlds, small worlds, and hidden dimensions. On average, a great world only had 30,000-50,000 or so tickets.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Holy Lords of various Holy Lands, the Elders and chief disciples of World King Holy Lands, the royalty and high level figures of World King level Divine Kingdoms, and even true World King powerhouses had gathered here. With several hundred million people gathered in the massive arena, any casually chosen person was someone who ruled over their own domain and was the god of trillions of people. But now, the members of this audience were nothing but ordinary spectators.

In the skies, a massive void was ripped open. A terrifying flow of energy passed through this void as a massive head a hundred miles long emerged from within the darkness. This head had a vicious lone horn sticking out from its center and it had massive scales as black as ink, as dark as night.

This was truly a tragedy. Even though he was the Great Elder of the Ancient Dragon Clan, he had actually never seen a living true dragon before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is a dragon…” Lin Ming saw this scene from the contestant waiting area.

Empyrean Demondawn was known as one of the highest Empyreans. Originally he had been known as a demonic fiend. On his path to becoming an Empyrean, the number of people he killed simply couldn’t be counted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the past, when he was still a half-step World King powerhouse, because he had recklessly killed too many people, he had aroused the anger of the world. Some great influences banded together to exterminate him, but the result was that they failed. Afterwards, Empyrean Demondawn broke through to the World King realm and instead exterminated those that tried to kill him, slaughtering everyone until not even dogs or chickens remained.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that war, the number of casualties used trillions as a measurement.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of demonic fiend had caused panic wherever he went. It was only when he became an Empyrean that he slowly cooled down and began to retreat from the known world. However, when the older generation of martial artists heard his name, they still felt their hearts tremble.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Empyrean Demondawn personally came?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is he here to watch Xiao Moxian?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“An Empyrean came in person to watch the First Martial Meeting?” Someone cried out in shock.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the last several First Martial Meetings, there simply hadn’t been any Empyreans present. This was because an Empyrean was born every million years while the First Martial Meeting was held every 4000-5000 years. The champion of the First Martial Meeting simply wasn’t comparable to an Empyrean. Only a martial artist with potential on par with an Empyrean was worthy to grasp the attention of one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, so it’s Brother Demondawn making a personal appearance.

Lin Ming could clearly hear that this voice belonged to Empyrean Vast Universe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Empyrean Demondawn appeared, Empyrean Vast Universe naturally had to make a show.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEmpyrean Vast Universe and Empyrean Demondawn were both simultaneously watching this First Martial Meeting. It was possible that even Empyrean Divine Dream was watching this event.

Although they didn’t see Empyrean Demondawn with their own eyes, knowing that they were watching the same tournament as an Empyrean level character was truly a thrilling matter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Even Empyreans have come. There are simply too many masters in this First Martial Meeting. If Senior-apprentice Brother Lin were to be compared with them then…” In the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s area, Yan Littlemoon was a bit worried. Although she knew that Lin Ming was strong, she had also previewed the information of the various geniuses before this, and each one was more terrifying than the last. Any one of them was an unfathomable existence to her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Everyone!

His figure was enlarged by an illusory magic array, allowing the several hundred million spectators to clearly see him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Now I shall announce the rules of the finals. There will be a total of 50 martial artists participating in the finals. The finals shall be divided into two stages. In the first stage, each person shall fight 18 battles. According to their performance in these 18 battles, the 50 martial artists shall be divided into two tiers. The first tier will consist of 10 people and the second tier will consist of 40 people. The finale of this tournament shall be played out with those 10 people in the first tier, and the top 10 list will be decided from them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“For those in the second tier, the following 40 rankings will undergo a round robin tournament.

One didn’t need to fight every other martial artist in the finals. As long as one could enter the first tier of martial artists, they would in fact only need to fight around 27 matches.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The first 18 matches shouldn’t be difficult.

But at this time, above the central arena Vast Cosmos loudly shouted out, “The first match shall begin – Frost Dream against Ling Feng!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first match would be Frost Dream’s debut!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was also reasonable. Frost Dream was the most popular candidate to win the First Martial Meeting. Although Xiao Moxian wasn’t weak, she was simply too young.

But, there was no one that didn’t know of Frost Dream and Xiao Moxian. Frost Dream was synonymous with icy cold perfection, a profound and untouchable woman. In the Divine Realm, she was the dream lover of countless young elites.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow that they saw Frost Dream step on stage, how could they not be excited?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrost Dream’s opponent was Ling Feng. Ling Feng was also a core disciple of an Empyrean Heavenly Palace. In the previous group matches he had achieved total victory. His performance had been immaculate the entire time; he was absolutely not weak.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who is that?

But, as a peak genius himself, he had absolute confidence in his skills. Or, at the very least he didn’t believe he would fold under the first strike. He should at least be able to fight a little battle with Frost Dream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe didn’t plan on admitting defeat here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let the match begin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eVast Cosmos loudly announced. At the same time, Ling Feng rushed towards Frost Dream. He held a great heavy sword in his hands as he slashed down at Frost Dream.

With a gentle wave of her hand, it was like a light spring breeze wafted past her. In the next moment, as Ling Feng was hurtling through the air, all of his protective true essence completely shattered. His entire body twisted like a broken kite line as he fell to the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the entire process, no one was able to clearly see what Frost Dream did.
