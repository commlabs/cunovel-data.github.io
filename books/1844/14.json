There, does that ease your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judith, I won\u0027t allow insolence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was soft and without a hint of anger in it. He\u0027d simply made a statement of fact. She responded in kind. \"I wasn\u0027t being insolent,\" she said. \"At least not on purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sincerity was very apparent. He nodded, satisfied. Then he tried to explain her position again. \"While you\u0027re on my land, you will obey my orders, because ultimately I\u0027m responsible for you. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you\u0027re sinfully possessive,\" she replied. \"And Lord, I am weary of this conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scowl told her he didn\u0027t care for that bit of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to turn the topic. \"Iain, you don\u0027t get much company, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she being flippant with him? He didn\u0027t think so. \"Very few outsiders are allowed on our land,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have a ready answer. In truth, he didn\u0027t even know why outsiders weren\u0027t allowed. He\u0027d never taken the time to think about it. \"It\u0027s just the way it\u0027s always been,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you kiss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat switch in subjects gained his full attention. \"Damned if I know,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint blush colored her cheeks. \"Will you be damned if you know again?\" He didn\u0027t understand what she was asking. The look in his eyes said as much. She pushed her embarrassment aside. She thought the moment of privacy would probably be the last they would share, and she meant to take blatant advantage. She reached up to stroke the side of his face with her fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" He captured her hand but didn\u0027t push her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touching you,\" she answered. She tried to sound nonchalant, yet knew she hadn\u0027t managed that feat. The intensity in his expression made her heart take notice. \"I was curious to know what your whiskers felt like.\" She smiled. \"And now I know.\" She pulled her hand away from his and let it drop back into her lap. \"They tickle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like a fool. Iain didn\u0027t ease her discomfort, either. He looked at a loss for words. Her boldness had surprised him, all right. She let out a little telling sigh. He probably thought she was just a shameless wench without any morals. She was certainly acting like one. What was the matter with her? She wasn\u0027t usually so aggressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was stroking his upper arm with the tips of her fingers while she mulled over his probable opinion of her. She wasn\u0027t even aware she was caressing him. He was. The gentle, soft as a butterfly\u0027s touch was driving him daft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at his chin when she gave him her roundabout apology. \"I\u0027m not usually so curious or so aggressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so startled by that question, her gaze flew up to his. The amusement in his eyes was evident. Was he mocking her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as though he had just crushed her heart. \"It was a serious question, Judith.\" His fingers now stroked the side of her face. Her reaction pleased him too. She leaned into his touch, instinctively wanting to gain more, like a kitten would lean into the hand that was stroking, caressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep remembering the way you kissed me, and I would like for you to kiss me again. It\u0027s a shameful confession, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027ve led a very sheltered—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth stopped her explanation. The kiss was very gentle, undemanding too, until she put her arms around his neck and turned all soft and willing on him. He couldn\u0027t control himself. The kiss turned hard, hot, consuming. Wonderfully arousing. She felt as though she were melting in his arms. She loved the taste of him, the feel of his tongue rubbing against hers, the way his mouth slanted over hers again and again. She loved the low growl that came from the back of his throat, and the rough gentleness in the way he held her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she hated the way he looked at her when he pulled away. It was the same expression he\u0027d worn the first time he\u0027d kissed her. Iain was angry he\u0027d touched her, probably disgusted as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to see that expression. She closed her eyes and collapsed against him. Her heart was slamming inside her chest. So was his. She could hear the thundering beat against her ear. He had been affected by the kiss, perhaps as much as she had. Was that why he was angry? He didn\u0027t want to like touching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was saddened by that possibility. Embarrassed too. She suddenly wanted to put some distance between them. She turned in his lap until her back rested against his chest. She tried to edge off his lap. He wouldn\u0027t let her. His hands settled on the sides of her h*ps and he roughly pulled her backside up tight against him. \"Don\u0027t move like that,\" he ordered. His voice was harsh, angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she\u0027d hurt him. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she replied. She kept her gaze downcast. \"I shouldn\u0027t have asked you to kiss me. I won\u0027t ever ask again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded like he was about to laugh. Her spine straightened in reaction. Iain felt as though he were holding a block of ice. \"Judith, tell me what\u0027s wrong,\" he commanded in a gruff whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might have been able to explain if he hadn\u0027t leaned down and rubbed the side of her face with his jaw. Shivers of pleasure raced across her shoulders. Lord, she was disgusted with herself. Why couldn\u0027t she control her reaction to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a future together isn\u0027t possible,\" she began. Her voice trembled. \"I\u0027m not a complete fool, even though I realize I\u0027ve been acting like one. My only excuse is that I felt safe with this attraction for you, because of that very reason.\" She wasn\u0027t making any sense. She was getting all riled up, though. She was gripping her hands together in real agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain this\u0027very reason,\u0027\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The very reason that I\u0027m English and you\u0027re not,\" she answered. \"I don\u0027t feel safe now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t feel safe with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded appalled. \"You don\u0027t understand,\" she whispered. She kept her gaze downcast so he wouldn\u0027t see her embarrassment. \"I thought my attraction for you was safe because you\u0027re a laird and I\u0027m English, but now I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that it\u0027s dangerous. You could break my heart, Iain Maitland, if I allow it. You must promise to stay away from me. It\u0027s… impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chin rested on top of her head. He inhaled her sweet light scent and tried not to think about how good she felt in his arms. \"Not impossible,\" he muttered. \"Damned complicated, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t realize the significance of what he was saying to her until he had actually spoken the thought aloud. He immediately considered all the ramifications. The problems were staggering. He decided he needed time, and distance, away from Judith, so he could think the matter through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe it would be easier if we just ignored each other,\" she suggested. \"When we reach your holding, you\u0027ll go back to your important duties and I\u0027ll keep busy with Frances Catherine. Yes, it will be easier that way, won\u0027t it, Iain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her. He took the reins in his hands and goaded the mount into a full gallop. His arm blocked the branches as they made their way through the narrow opening. He felt her tremble, and once they were in the fields at the base of his home, he pulled her cloak from behind his saddle and covered her with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither spoke a word to the other for the next several hours. They rode across a magnificent field of rape; the dazzling yellow was so brilliant to the eye, she had to squint against the sheer beauty of it all. Cottages nestled intimately between the proud pines covering the hills beyond. Flowers of every color in the rainbow spilled down the hillside, surrounded by a thick carpet of grass as green as emeralds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode across an arched bridge atop a sparkling clear stream, then started up the steep climb. The air was thick with the scent of summer. The aroma of the flowers mingled with that of the clean earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScots, both men and women, came outside their cottages to watch the procession pass by. The clan members all wore the same colors, their plaids identical to Iain\u0027s, and for that reason she knew they\u0027d finally reached his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was suddenly so excited to see Frances Catherine, she could barely sit still. She turned to smile at Iain. He stared straight ahead, ignoring her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going directly to Frances Catherine\u0027s home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be waiting in the courtyard at the top of the crest,\" Iain answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t even spared her a glance when he\u0027d explained. She turned around again. She wasn\u0027t going to let his sour mood ruin her excitement. She was enchanted with the rugged beauty around her and couldn\u0027t wait to tell Frances Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she got a good look at Iain\u0027s keep. Lord, it was ugly. The huge stone structure was on the very top of the crest. There wasn\u0027t a wall surrounding the building, either. Iain must not have been worried about the enemy breaching his home. She guessed he\u0027d have plenty of time to become alerted, as an outsider would have quite a climb to reach the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gray mist hung down over the roof of the mammoth structure. The main building was square in shape, and as gray and dreary as the skies above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtyard wasn\u0027t any better. It was more dirt than grass, and as worn-out as the scarred double doors leading into the keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith turned her attention to the crowd gathered before her. The men nodded to Iain, but the women didn\u0027t show any outward reaction to their arrival. Most stayed behind the men, silent, watching, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith looked for Frances Catherine. She really wasn\u0027t at all apprehensive until she spotted her friend and got a good look at her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine looked close to tears. Her face was deathly pale. She was obviously frightened. Judith didn\u0027t understand the reason for that reaction, but her friend\u0027s worry immediately became her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain forced his mount to a stop. Gowrie, Alex, and Brodick immediately did the same. Frances Catherine took a step forward. The man standing next to her grabbed hold of her arm and forced her to stay where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her attention to Patrick Maitland. She had little doubt he was Frances Catherine\u0027s husband. He looked very like Iain, and though he was slighter in build, his frown was every bit as fierce as Iain\u0027s was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked worried too. When he glanced down at his wife, Judith realized his concern was for Frances Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friend was wringing her hands together. She stared up at Judith for a long minute, then took another hesitant step forward. Patrick didn\u0027t stop her this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an incredibly awkward moment because of the large crowd watching so intently. \"Why is Frances Catherine frightened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d whispered that question to Iain. He leaned down close to her ear and answered her question with one of his own. \"Why are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to deny that accusation, but Iain drew her attention by gently prying her hands away from his arm. Lord, she\u0027d had a death grip on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a little squeeze before dismounting. He nodded his greeting to Patrick, turned and assisted Judith to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t spare him a glance now. She turned and slowly walked over to her friend. She stopped when she was a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what to say to make Frances Catherine\u0027s fear go away. Or her own. She remembered that when they were little, when one cried, the other immediately joined in. That memory led to another, and she suddenly knew exactly what she wanted to say in greeting to her dear friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze was centered on Frances Catherine\u0027s swollen stomach. She took another step forward and looked up into her eyes. In a low whisper she was certain only her friend could hear, she said, \"I specifically remember we both promised never to drink from any man\u0027s goblet of wine. From the looks of you, Frances Catherine, I\u0027m thinking you broke your word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine let out a low gasp. Her eyes widened in surprise. Then she burst into laughter and threw herself into Judith\u0027s arms. She remembered how she had been so certain and so full of authority when she\u0027d told Judith a woman could only get pregnant if she drank out of a man\u0027s goblet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe all but swallowed Judith up when she hugged her. The two women were laughing and crying at the same time, and to the crowd gathered around them, they appeared to have lost their senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension and the worry eased out of Patrick\u0027s shoulders. He turned to look at Iain and slowly nodded. His brother nodded back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey had been well worth the trouble, Patrick decided. He clasped his hands behind his back and waited for his wife to remember her manners. The joy in her expression more than made up for her inattention. And Lord, how he had missed the sound of her laughter. A part of him wanted to take this Englishwoman into his own arms and hug her just as fiercely as his wife was doing, to let her know how much he appreciated her loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to wait another five minutes or so before his wife remembered he was there. The two women were talking at the same time, asking and answering their own questions. They created a whirlwind of happy chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain was just as pleased as Patrick with the reunion. He was a bit surprised, too, for until this very minute he hadn\u0027t realized that women could actually be trusted friends with each other. The strength of the bond between Judith and Frances Catherine was unique. It intrigued him. He remembered Judith had told him they\u0027d become friends before they were old enough to understand they were supposed to be enemies, and he found he admired the two of them all the more for continuing to give each other loyalty even after they had learned the lessons of distrust… and hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith remembered her audience before Frances Catherine did. \"We have so much to catch up on,\" she said. \"But now I must thank Iain and the others for bringing me to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine grabbed hold of her hand. \"First, I must introduce you to my husband,\" she said. She turned to smile up at Patrick. \"This is Judith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick\u0027s smile was a replica of Iain\u0027s. \"I gathered as much,\" he told his wife. \"I\u0027m pleased to meet you, Judith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have made a nice curtsy if Frances Catherine had let go of her hand. She smiled instead. \"And I\u0027m pleased to be here, Patrick. Thank you for inviting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attention turned to Iain. He\u0027d taken the reins of his mount and started toward the stables. She tugged her hand away from Frances Catherine, promised to come right back, and then hurried after her escort. \"Iain, please wait,\" she called out. \"I wanted to say thank-you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-14.html","bookId":1844,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM"}
