{"id":44057,"no":28,"title":"XXVIII OLDEST GAME ON EARTH","content":"The cause of our interruption was Camille Harper. We had been pacing the side veranda and she came out upon it with an unconscious song on her lips, and on one finger a tiny basket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her gentle irruption found me standing almost on the spot where she had stood two evenings before and said good-bye to me. From this point a path led to the rear of the house, where within a light paling fence bloomed a garden. She gave us a blithe good-morning as she passed, descended the two or three side steps, and tripped toward the garden gate, a wee affair which she might have lifted off its hinges with one thumb. I saw her try its latch two or three times and then turn back discomfited because the loose frame had sagged a trifle and needed to be raised half an inch. I did not understand the helplessness of girls as well then as I do now; I ran and opened the gate; and when I shut it again she and I were alone inside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She let me cut the flowers. \"You know who\u0027s here?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" I guilefully replied, \"I came with him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t mean Lieutenant Ferry,\" she responded, \"nor anybody you\u0027d ever guess if you don\u0027t know; but you do, don\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I said I knew and went on gathering sweet-pea blossoms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you ever see her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" I replied, stepping away for some roses, \"I--saw her--by chance--for a moment--she was in the wagon she\u0027s got here--last --eh,--Thursday--morn\u0027--\" I came back trimming the roses, and as she reached for them and our glances met, she laughed and replied, with a roguish droop of the head--\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She told us about it. And you needn\u0027t look so disturbed; she only praised you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still I frowned. \"How does it come that she\u0027s here, anyhow?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why! she\u0027s got to be everywhere! She\u0027s a war-correspondent! She was at the front yesterday nearly the whole time, near enough to see some of the fighting, and to hear it all! she calls it \u0027only a skirmish\u0027!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When did she get here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About five in the morning. But we didn\u0027t see her then; she shut herself up and wrote and wrote and wrote! They say she runs the most daring risks! And they say she\u0027s so wise in finding out what the Yankees are going to do and why they\u0027re going to do it, that they\u0027d be nearly as glad to catch her as to catch Lieutenant Ferry! Didn\u0027t you know? Ah, you knew!\" She attempted a reproachful glance, but exhaled happiness like a fragrance. I asked how she had heard these things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did I hear them? Let me see. Oh, yes! from--from Harry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I flinched angrily. \"From what?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked into her basket and fingered its flowers. \"That\u0027s what he asked me to call him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I stiffened up as though I heard a thief picking the lock of my lawful treasure. She threw me, side wise, a bantering smile and then a more winsome glance, but I refused to see either. I burned with so many feelings at once that I could no more have told them than I could have raised a tune. \"Don\u0027t you like him?\" she asked, and tried to be very arch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Like whom?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know perfectly well,\" she replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I do not like him. Do you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why,--yes,--I do. I--I thought everybody did.\" She averted her face and toyed with the sweet-pea vines. Suddenly she gulped, faced me, blinked rapidly, and said \"If I oughtn\u0027t to call him--that,--then I oughtn\u0027t to have called--\" she dropped her eyes and bit her lip.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That,\" I replied, \"is a very different matter! At least I had hoped it was!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her rejoinder came in a low, grieved monotone: \"Did you say had hoped?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was the sweetest question my ear had ever caught, and I asked her, I scarce know how, if I might still say \"do hope\".\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, I--I didn\u0027t know you ever did say it. I don\u0027t see that I have any right to forbid you saying things--to--to yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So we played the game--oldest game on earth--and loveliest. Bungling moves we made, as you see, and sometimes did not know whose move it was. At length she admitted that this is a very unsafe world in which to be kind to soldiers. I told how fickle some of them were. She would not say she would--or wouldn\u0027t--make my case a permanent exception or a solitary one; yet with me she blissfully pooh-poohed the idea that our acquaintance was new, she being so wonderfully like my mother, and I being so wonderfully ditto, ditto. And when I burst into a blazing eulogy of my mother, my listener gave me kinder looks than I ever deserved of any woman alive. On my trying to reciprocate, she asked me for more flowers and hurried back to our earlier theme.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And really, you know, they say she\u0027s almost as truly a scout as Ned Fer\u0027--as Lieutenant Ferry-Durand. She\u0027s from New Orleans, you know, and she\u0027s like us, half-Creole; but her other half is Highland Scotch--isn\u0027t that romantic! When she told us about it she laughed and said it explained some things in her which nothing else could excuse! Wasn\u0027t that funny!--oh, pshaw! it doesn\u0027t sound a bit funny as I tell it, but she said it in such a droll way! She was so full of fun and frolic that day! You can\u0027t conceive how full of them she is--sometimes; how soberly she can say the funniest things, and how funnily she can say the soberest things!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t you like him? she asked, and tried to be very arch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You say she was so full of fun that day; what day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young thing gaped at me, gasped, and melted half to the ground: \"O--oh--I\u0027ve let it out!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, you may as well go right on, now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She straightened to her toes, covered her open mouth an instant, and then said \"Yes, we knew her--at our house--in New Orleans--poor New Orleans! Your mother--oh, your splendid, lovely little mother is such a brave Confederate!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My mother brought her to your house?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, oh, yes! and that\u0027s why it isn\u0027t wrong to tell you. Charlotte\u0027s been three times through the lines, to and from the city; once by way of Natchez and twice through Baton Rouge. And oh, the things she\u0027s brought out to our poor boys in the hospitals!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Generals\u0027 uniforms, for example?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, now you\u0027re real mean! No! what she\u0027s brought the most of is--guess! You\u0027ll never guess it in the world!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hindoo grammars!--No? Well, then,--perfumery!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, you! No, I\u0027ll tell you.\" She spoke prudently; I had to bow my ear so close that it tingled: \"Dolls!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My amazement was genuine. \"For our sick soldiers!\" I sighed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her eyes danced; she leaned away and nodded. Then she drew nearer than before: \"Dolls!\" she murmured again;--\"and pincushions!--and emeries!--and \u0027rats\u0027! you know, for ladies\u0027 hair--and chignon-cushions!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For our sick soldiers!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes!--stuffed with quinine!\" She laughed in her handkerchief till the smell of the sweet-peas was lost in the odor of frangipani, and she staggered almost into my arms. But that sobered her. \"And when we speak of the risk she runs of being sent to Ship Island she laughs and says, \u0027Life is strife.\u0027 She says she\u0027d like it long, but she\u0027s got to have it broad.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Life is strife indeed to her,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! do you know that too?--and another reason she gives for taking those awful risks is that \u0027it\u0027s the best use she can make of her silly streak\u0027--as if she had any such thing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why did my mother bring her to you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! she had letters from uncle to aunt Martha! He thinks she\u0027s wonderful!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Does your father think so, too?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My father? no; but he\u0027s prejudiced! That\u0027s one of the things I can never understand--why nearly all the girls I know have such prejudiced fathers.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70544.html","bookId":414,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:24:30 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:24:30 AM"}
