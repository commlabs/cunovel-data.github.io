Pale, he wiped his forehead on his sleeve. \"Director, we have no choice. We\u0027ve got to kill power to the databank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unacceptable,\" Fontaine replied. \"The results would be devastating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba knew the director was right. There were over three thousand ISDN connections tying into the NSA databank from all over the world. Every day military commanders accessed up-to-the-instant satellite photos of enemy movement. Lockheed engineers downloaded compartmentalized blueprints of new weaponry. Field operatives accessed mission updates. The NSA databank was the backbone of thousands of U.S. government operations. Shutting it down without warning would cause life-and-death intelligence blackouts all over the globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m aware of the implications, sir,\" Jabba said, \"but we have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain yourself,\" Fontaine ordered. He shot a quick glance at Susan standing beside him on the podium. She seemed miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba took a deep breath and wiped his brow again. From the look on his face, it was clear to the group on the podium that they were not going to like what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This worm,\" Jabba began. \"This worm is not an ordinary degenerative cycle. It\u0027s a selective cycle. In other words, it\u0027s a worm with taste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrinkerhoff opened his mouth to speak, but Fontaine waved him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most destructive applications wipe a databank clean, \"Jabba continued, \"but this one is more complex. It deletes only those files that fall within certain parameters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it won\u0027t attack the whole databank?\" Brinkerhoff asked hopefully. \"That\u0027s good, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jabba exploded. \"It\u0027s bad! It\u0027s very fucking bad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool it!\" Fontaine ordered. \"What parameters is this worm looking for? Military? Covert ops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba shook his head. He eyed Susan, who was still distant, and then Jabba\u0027s eyes rose to meet the director\u0027s. \"Sir, as you know, anyone who wants to tie into this databank from the outside has to pass a series of security gates before they\u0027re admitted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine nodded. The databank\u0027s access hierarchies were brilliantly conceived; authorized personnel could dial in via the Internet and World Wide Web. Depending on their authorization sequence, they were permitted access to their own compartmentalized zones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027re tied to the global Internet, \"Jabba explained, \"hackers, foreign governments, and EFF sharks circle this databank twenty-four hours a day and try to break in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Fontaine said, \"and twenty-four hours a day, our security filters keep them out. What\u0027s your point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba gazed down at the printout. \"My point is this. Tankado\u0027s worm is not targeting our data.\" He cleared his throat. \"It\u0027s targeting our security filters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine blanched. Apparently he understood the implications-this worm was targeting the filters that kept the NSA databank confidential. Without filters, all of the information in the databank would become accessible to everyone on the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to shut down,\" Jabba repeated. \"In about an hour, every third grader with a modem is going to have top U.S. security clearance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine stood a long moment without saying a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba waited impatiently and finally turned to Soshi. \"Soshi! VR! NOW!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoshi dashed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba relied on VR often. In most computer circles, VR meant \"virtual reality,\" but at the NSA it meant vis-rep-visual representation. In a world full of technicians and politicians all having different levels of technical understanding, a graphic representation was often the only way to make a point; a single plummeting graph usually aroused ten times the reaction inspired by volumes of spreadsheets. Jabba knew a VR of the current crisis would make its point instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"VR!\" Soshi yelled from a terminal at the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA computer-generated diagram flashed to life on the wall before them. Susan gazed up absently, detached from the madness around her. Everyone in the room followed Jabba\u0027s gaze to the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diagram before them resembled a bull\u0027s-eye. In the center was a red circle marked data. Around the center were five concentric circles of differing thickness and color. The outermost circle was faded, almost transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got a five-tier level of defense,\" Jabba explained. \"A primary Bastion Host, two sets of packet filters for FTP and X-eleven, a tunnel block, and finally a PEM-based authorization window right off the Truffle project. The outside shield that\u0027s disappearing represents the exposed host. It\u0027s practically gone. Within the hour, all five shields will follow. After that, the world pours in. Every byte of NSA data becomes public domain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine studied the VR, his eyes smoldering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrinkerhoff let out a weak whimper. \"This worm can open our databank to the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Child\u0027s play for Tankado,\" Jabba snapped. \"Gauntlet was our fail-safe. Strathmore blew it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an act of war,\" Fontaine whispered, an edge in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba shook his head. \"I really doubt Tankado ever meant for it to go this far. I suspect he intended to be around to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine gazed up at the screen and watched the first of the five walls disappear entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bastion Host is toast!\" a technician yelled from the back of the room. \"Second shield\u0027s exposed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to start shutting down,\" Jabba urged. \"From the looks of the VR, we\u0027ve got about forty-five minutes. Shutdown is a complex process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. The NSA databank had been constructed in such a way as to ensure it would never lose power-accidentally or if attacked. Multiple fail-safes for phone and power were buried in reinforced steel canisters deep underground, and in addition to the feeds from within the NSA complex, there were multiple backups off main public grids. Shutting down involved a complex series of confirmations and protocols-significantly more complicated than the average nuclear submarine missile launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have time,\" Jabba said, \"if we hurry. Manual shutdown should take about thirty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine continued staring up at the VR, apparently pondering his options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director!\" Jabba exploded. \"When these firewalls fall, every user on the planet will be issued top-security clearance! And I\u0027m talking upper level! Records of covert ops! Overseas agents! Names and locations of everyone in the federal witness protection program! Launch code confirmations! We must shut down! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director seemed unmoved. \"There must be some other way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Jabba spat, \"there is! The kill-code! But the only guy who knows it happens to be dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about brute force?\" Brinkerhoff blurted. \"Can we guess the kill-code?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba threw up his arms. \"For Christ sake! Kill-codes are like encryption keys-random! Impossible to guess! If you think you can type 600 trillion entries in the next forty-five minutes, be my guest!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kill-code\u0027s in Spain,\" Susan offered weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone on the podium turned. It was the first thing she had said in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan looked up, bleary-eyed. \"Tankado gave it away when he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pass-key...\" Susan shivered as she spoke. \"Commander Strathmore sent someone to find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" Jabba demanded. \"Did Strathmore\u0027s man find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan tried to fight it, but the tears began to flow. \"Yes,\" she choked. \"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 111\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn earsplitting yell cut through the control room. \"Sharks!\" It was Soshi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba spun toward the VR. Two thin lines had appeared outside the concentric circles. They looked like sperm trying to breach a reluctant egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood\u0027s in the water, folks!\" Jabba turned back to the director. \"I need a decision. Either we start shutting down, or we\u0027ll never make it. As soon as these two intruders see the Bastion Host is down, they\u0027ll send up a war cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine did not respond. He was deep in thought. Susan Fletcher\u0027s news of the pass-key in Spain seemed promising to him. He shot a glance toward Susan in the back of the room. She appeared to be in her own world, collapsed in a chair, her head buried in her hands. Fontaine was unsure exactly what had triggered the reaction, but whatever it was, he had no time for it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a decision!\" Jabba demanded. \"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine looked up. He spoke calmly. \"Okay, you\u0027ve got one. We are not shutting down. We\u0027re going to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba\u0027s jaw dropped. \"What? But that\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A gamble,\" Fontaine interrupted. \"A gamble we just might win.\" He took Jabba\u0027s cellular and punched a few keys. \"Midge,\" he said. \"It\u0027s Leland Fontaine. Listen carefully....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 112\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better know what the hell you\u0027re doing, Director,\" Jabba hissed. \"We\u0027re about to lose shut-down capability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine did not respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, the door at the back of the control room opened, and Midge came dashing in. She arrived breathless at the podium. \"Director! The switchboard is patching it through right now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine turned expectantly toward the screen on the front wall. Fifteen seconds later the screen crackled to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image on screen was snowy and stilted at first, and gradually grew sharper. It was a QuickTime digital transmission-only five frames per second. The image revealed two men. One was pale with a buzz cut, the other a blond all-American. They were seated facing the camera like two newscasters waiting to go on the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is this?\" Jabba demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit tight,\" Fontaine ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men appeared to be inside a van of some sort. Electronic cabling hung all around them. The audio connection crackled to life. Suddenly there was background noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inbound audio,\" a technician called from behind them. \"Five seconds till two-way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are they?\" Brinkerhoff asked, uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eye in the sky,\" Fontaine replied, gazing up at the two men he had sent to Spain. It had been a necessary precaution. Fontaine had believed in almost every aspect of Strathmore\u0027s plan-the regrettable but necessary removal of Ensei Tankado, rewriting Digital Fortress-it was all solid. But there was one thing that made Fontaine nervous: the use of Hulohot. Hulohot was skilled, but he was a mercenary. Was he trustworthy? Would he take the pass-key for himself? Fontaine wanted Hulohot covered, just incase, and he had taken the requisite measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 113\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not!\" The man with the buzz cut yelled into the camera. \"We have orders! We report to Director Leland Fontaine and Leland Fontaine only!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine looked mildly amused. \"You don\u0027t know who I am, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter, does it?\" the blond fired hotly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me explain,\" Fontaine interjected. \"Let me explain something right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, the two men were red-faced, spilling their guts to the director of the National Security Agency. \"D-director,\" the blond stammered, \"I\u0027m Agent Coliander. This is Agent Smith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Fontaine said. \"Just brief us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the back of the room, Susan Fletcher sat and fought the suffocating loneliness that pressed down around her. Eyes closed, and ears ringing, she wept. Her body had gone numb. The mayhem in the control room faded to a dull murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gathering on the podium listened, restless, as Agent Smith began his briefing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On your orders, Director,\" Smith began, \"we\u0027ve been here in Seville for two days, trailing Mr. Ensei Tankado.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the kill,\" Fontaine said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith nodded. \"We observed from inside the van at about fifty meters. The kill was smooth. Hulohot was obviously a pro. But afterward his directive went awry. Company arrived. Hulohot never got the item.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine nodded. The agents had contacted him in South America with news that something had gone wrong, so Fontaine had cut his trip short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColiander took over. \"We stayed with Hulohot as you ordered. But he never made a move for the morgue. Instead, he picked up the trail of some other guy. Looked private. Coat and tie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Private?\" Fontaine mused. It sounded like a Strathmore play-wisely keeping the NSA out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FTP filters failing!\" a technician called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need the item,\" Fontaine pressed. \"Where is Hulohot now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith looked over his shoulder. \"Well... he\u0027s with us, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine exhaled. \"Where?\" It was the best new she\u0027d heard all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith reached toward the lens to make an adjustment. The camera swept across the inside of the van to reveal two limp bodies propped against the back wall. Both were motionless. One was a large man with twisted wire-rim glasses. The other was young with a shock of dark hair and a bloody shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hulohot\u0027s the one on the left,\" Smith offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hulohot\u0027s dead?\" the director demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine knew there would be time for explanations later. He glanced up at the thinning shields. \"Agent Smith,\" he said slowly and clearly. \"The item. I need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith looked sheepish. \"Sir, we still have no idea what the item is. We\u0027re on a need-to-know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 114\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then look again!\" Fontaine declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director watched in dismay as the stilted image of the agents searched the two limp bodies in the van for a list of random numbers and letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba was pale. \"Oh my God, they can\u0027t find it. We\u0027re dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Losing FTP filters!\" a voice yelled. \"Third shield\u0027s exposed!\" There was a new flurry of activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the front screen, the agent with the buzz cut held out his arms in defeat. \"Sir, the pass-key isn\u0027t here. We\u0027ve searched both men. Pockets. Clothing. Wallets. No sign at all. Hulohot was wearing a Monocle computer, and we\u0027ve checked that too. It doesn\u0027t look like he ever transmitted anything remotely resembling random characters-only a list of kills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit!\" Fontaine seethed, suddenly losing his cool. \"It\u0027s got to be there! Keep looking!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba had apparently seen enough-Fontaine had gambled and lost. Jabba took over. The huge Sys-Sec descended from his pulpit like a storm off a mountain. He swept through his army of programmers calling out commands. \"Access auxiliary kills! Start shutting it down! Do it now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll never make it!\" Soshi yelled. \"We need a half hour! By the time we shut down, it will be too late!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba opened his mouth to reply, but he was cut short by a scream of agony from the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned. Like an apparition, Susan Fletcher rose from her crouched position in the rear of the chamber. Her face was white, her eyes transfixed on the freeze-frame of David Becker, motionless and bloody, propped up on the floor of the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed him!\" she screamed. \"You killed him!\" She stumbled toward the image and reached out. \"David...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked up in confusion. Susan advanced, still calling, her eyes never leaving the projection of David\u0027s body. \"David.\" She gasped, staggering forward. \"Oh, David... how could they-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine seemed lost. \"You know this man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan swayed unsteadily as she passed the podium. She stopped a few feet in front of the enormous projection and stared up, bewildered and numb, calling over and over to the man she loved. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-64.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
