(2)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who did this…” Long Shiya suppressed his fury with great difficulty as he asked through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, with his cultivation level, he should not be so impulsive and easily angered. However, do not forget that this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had lived for more than a hundred years before finally accepting such a favoured disciple! Although he had personally told Zhou Weiqing that he would not help him do anything, in truth, could he really let him go through everything by himself? That was definitely not possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this period of time, he had seen with his own eyes how hard Zhou Weiqing had worked, the amount of effort he had put into his cultivation, and the sheer speed of improvement. The amount of talent, genius and more importantly, character and willingness to put in the work had gained Long Shiya’s approval and acknowledgement. Seeing this young disciple who had been alive and kicking happily just yesterday in such dire straits now, barely hanging on in a breath, with countless of broken bones everywhere… how could Long Shiya not be enraged?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly Snow Mountain… the Lion Prince, Gu YingBIng…” Shangguan Fei’er forced herself to answer quickly, panting for breath with the sheer difficulty of speaking through the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lion Prince?” A strange light flashed in Long Shiya’s eyes. “You all met at the northern border?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er nodded, saying urgently. “Senior, please heal Little Fatty first. He is so severely injured, and he also lost so much blood… I’m afraid his life might be in danger!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya seemed to ignore her words, lifting his head and looking off into the distance. In the next instance, an impossibly loud howl of rage rang out: “Old Monster Xue, this old man will now be irreconcilably opposed to you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Long Shiya had already tried his best to suppress his own aura, that angry howl still rose into the skies, reverberating through the entire area as it blew through the top of the entire tent and tearing a large hole in it. Not only did the entire Peerless Battalion hear it, even the nearby Legions could hear that thunderous roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two... go out.” Long Shiya waved his hands, and an invisible force swept both Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo off their feet, gently sending them out of the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Shangguan Fei’er had been sent out of the tent, she finally heaved a sigh of relief. She knew in her mind that Zhou Weiqing would not die, but no matter what, the concern she had would still cause her to worry. After all, despite his severe injuries, with his tough physique and unbelievable recovery powers, he should eventually recover. Of course, now that Long Shiya was able to heal him, Zhou Weiqing would definitely be alright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even as her heart was aching for Zhou Weiqing with concern, she was left speechless by Long Shiya’s howl. It was clearly targeted at the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord… This Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was indeed intrepid; it looked like he did not really hold a lot of respect for the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the tent, a thick blue light rose, spreading throughout the tent as it enveloped Zhou Weiqing’s entire body. Within the blue light, Zhou Weiqing’s body slowly levitated up, as if he was floating in a thick viscous liquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya did not use his Light Attribute Skills to heal his disciple. Although the Light Attribute was superior at healing, he had to consider that Zhou Weiqing had the Demonic and Darkness Attributes. If he used a Light Attribute Healing Skill, it could even had an adverse effect on Zhou Weiqing. From a certain perspective, Zhou Weiqing’s body was inclined towards the Demonic/Evil side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Water Attribute had some Healing Skills as well, and though they might not be as effective as the Life or Light Attributes, one had to consider who was the user as well. With Long Shiya’s cultivation level, the Water Attribute Healing Skills in his hands would be no weaker than any other Attribute’s Healing Skills, with the exception of not being to use the Resurrection Skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing was fully covered by the blue light, his wounds were fully presented to Long Shiya’s senses. The more he examined all the wounds, the greater the cold light in Long Shiya’s eyes. To any ordinary person, perhaps even for other Jewel Masters, such a body of injuries… even two others would have died long ago. His internal organs were jarred out of position, with a great loss of blood, and at least a dozen bones were broken in various different areas. With Zhou Weiqing’s physique and toughness, one could imagine how many attacks and how much power had been behind those blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lion Prince Gu YingBing… Long Shiya definitely knew of him. After all, he had ascended the Heavenly Snow Mountain more than once. Long Shiya was not ashamed about Zhou Weiqing losing to him. After all, Zhou Weiqing was more than a dozen years younger than he was, and more so, he had been the First Disciple of the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord for so long, as compared to the short time that Zhou Weiqing had been cultivating. There was absolutely nothing to be ashamed about such a loss. However, Long Shiya’s heart was filled with rage. No matter what the reason was, this Lion Prince had almost killed his only disciple and successor, and he would not let things rest so easily. He would have to look for that old monster Xue to get justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dense Water Attribute Heavenly Energy slowly infused into Zhou Weiqing’s body, first carefully moving his internal organs to their correct positions before covering them with a protective layer, enriching and healing them. Next were the bones… with Long Shiya’s fine control, all the bones were re-set into their proper positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, the amount of Heavenly Energy infused increased, improving the healing effect, cleansing the body, clearing his meridians, fixing all the various injuries major and minor. In the end, such critical injuries that would look fatal to most was now recovering swiftly with the aid of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, in this unbelievable recovery speed, not only was Long Shiya\u0027s power and cultivation of utmost importance, the toughness and sheer recovery rate of Zhou Weiqing’s own body played a major role as well. With the aid and restoration of the Water Attribute Heavenly Energy, his energy whirlpools were able to draw energy from outside to help his body sustain and recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo whole hours passed, and as the worst of his injuries slowly recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing\u0027s eyes fluttered open at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing felt his entire body itching like crazy. This was the feeling of the many wounds recovering so quickly. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Long Shiya standing before him, a sombre, angry look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master.” Zhou Weiqing said with some embarrassment, attempting to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t move.” Long Shiya said. “Your wounds might have healed, but you must rest for at least a day before you can even get up, otherwise you might leave some unforeseen long term consequences…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at that moment, the tent flap raised, and Duan Tianlang entered from outside. In the entire Peerless Battalion, only he would dare to walk into Long Shiya’s tent so casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fatty Long, what is going on? What were you howling about just now?” In truth, Duan Tianlang had reached a while ago, but he had sensed Long Shiya circulating a massive amount of Heavenly Energy within the tent earlier, and had not wanted to disturb him. He had waited outside until he sensed the Heavenly Energy reverberations stop, before entering the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph! Weiqing was almost beaten to death, what do you think I was yelling about? Old Duan, you remain here first. Later, when Weiqing is better, I will head to the WanShou Empire to beat up that little bastard Gu YingBing, then I’ll head up the Heavenly Snow Mountain to look for that old bastard… Old Monster Xue… and get justice for this matter. Weiqing, you don’t have to worry about anything. Hmph, having the disciples of the Old Monster Xue coming to bully my disciple, your Teacher will stand up for you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of teacher was the most loved by their disciples? Without question, it was the protective ones who would take their sides!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn hearing that his Master would actually go up the Heavenly Snow Mountain to confront the powerful Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord on his behalf, Zhou Weiqing’s heart was filled with warmth, as if the pain in his entire body lessened considerably somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master, don’t go. At least, not now…” Zhou Weiqing quickly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Are you afraid I cannot beat that Old Monster Xue? Don\u0027t worry, even if I can’t defeat him, this old man can still let him pay a heavy price.” Long Shiya said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing remained silent for a moment, his eyes flashing in a firm resolute light before he said: “Master, do you have any way for me to grow in strength quickly in a short period of time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya furrowed his brow, both a surprised glee and worry warring in his heart. The surprised happiness was that Zhou Weiqing had not been brought down by this defeat, still holding much fighting spirit, and he was very happy about that. As for the worry, naturally that was because the Heavenly Snow Mountain was no mere trifle to go up against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weiqing, tell your Senior Uncle, why did that Lion Prince come looking specially for you? For someone like Gu YingBing and his status in the entire WanShou Empire, to actually come all the way here to look for you and yet not killing you, I’m afraid there is more to this matter right.” Duan Tianlang was much calmer and cool-headed than the enraged Long Shiya, and he asked the critical question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn embarrassed look flashed across Zhou Weiqing’s face, but he dared not hide any details. As such, he spoke in detail about how he had met Tian’er so long ago, and all the years he had spent with her… all the way to when she left him, as well as the real reason why the Lion Prince had looked for him, even down to the letter Tian’er had written to him and his own analysis of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be beaten up like that because of a woman, it was not something glorious indeed. However, Zhou Weiqing had his own plans, and he knew that only if he stated things clearly to his teacher and explain what he thought about the letter… only then could he have that last small chance to gain her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, both Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang were stunned into silence momentarily, staring dazedly at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, Long Shiya asked Zhou Weiqing uncertainly: “Little Fatty, are you trying to say that… you got together with that Old Monster Xue’s daughter? And she has also fallen for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing lowered his head in shame and nodded slightly, thinking to himself: \u003ci\u003eSigh… to be beaten up to such a state for a woman’s sake, this is truly a huge loss of face. Looks like I’ll have to suffer a bout of scolding from Master first. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, what happened next left him at a loss whether to cry or to laugh...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya abruptly slapped his immense belly, causing it to shake, as he shouted excitedly: “Damn! That is bloody great! Such a satisfying feeling hahaha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuan Tianlang was also laughing heartily as he said: “Weiqing, well done! You have truly gained face for our entire Legacy of Strength Sect!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two inglorious old fellows looked at each other as they continued laughing smugly loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-161-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-162-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-161-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
