{"id":11651,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. LAZARUS.","content":"It was a very little shop of squat appearance, as if the upper storey had gradually crushed down the lower. Three gilt balls dangling in mid-air over the wide door indicated the calling of the owner, and, in order that there should be no mistake, the dusty, rain-streaked windows displayed the legend, \"Lazarus, Pawnbroker,\" in blistered golden letters. There were three windows in the upper storey, and these being innocent of blinds or curtains, with the addition of one or two panes being broken, gave the top of the house a somewhat dismantled look. The lower windows, however, made up for the blankness of the upper ones, being full of marvels, and behind their dingy glass could be seen innumerable articles, representing the battered wrecks of former prosperity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gold and silver watches, with little parchment labels attached, setting forth their value, displayed themselves in a tempting row, and their chains were gracefully festooned between them, intermixed with strings of red coral, old-fashioned lockets, and bracelets of jet and amber. Worn-out silver teapots were placed dismally at the back in company with cracked cups and saucers of apparently rare old Worcester and SÃªvres china. Dingy velvet trays, containing innumerable coins and medals of every description, antique jewellery of a mode long since out of date, were incongruously mingled with revolvers, guns, spoons, cruets, and japanned trays, decorated with sprawling golden dragons; richly-chased Indian daggers, tarnished silver mugs, in company with deadly-looking American bowie knives; bank-notes of long since insolvent banks were displayed as curiosities, while a child\u0027s rattle lay next to a Book of Beauty, from out whose pages looked forth simpering faces of the time of D\u0027Orsay and Lady Blessington. And over all this queer heterogeneous mixture the dust lay thick and grey, as if trying for very pity to hide these remnants of past splendours and ruined lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shop was broad, low-roofed, and shallow, with a choky atmosphere of dust, through which the golden sunlight slanted in heavy, solid-looking beams. On the one side there was a row of little partitions like bathing-boxes, designed to secure secrecy to those who transacted business with Mr. Lazarus, and, on the other, long rows of old clothes were hanging up against the wall, looking like the phantoms of their former owners. At the back, a door, covered with faded green baize, and decorated with brass-headed nails, gave admittance to the private office of the presiding genius of the place. The whole appearance of the shop was gloomy in the extreme, and the floor, being covered with boxes and bundles, with a little clearing here and there, it was naturally rather embarrassing to strangers (especially as the bright sunlight outside prevented them seeing an inch before their noses) when they first entered the dismal den wherein Mr. Lazarus sat like a spider waiting for unwary flies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In one of the bathing machines aforesaid, a large red-faced woman, with a gruff voice and a strong odour of gin, was trying to conclude a bargain with a small, white-faced Jewish youth whose black beady eyes were scornfully examining a dilapidated teapot, which the gruff lady asserted was silver, and which the Jewish youth emphatically declared was not. The gruff female, who answered to the name of Tibsey, grew wrathful at this opposition, and prepared to do battle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Old \u0027uns knows more nor youngers,\" she growled in an angry tone. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t by the sauce of babes and sucklers as I\u0027m goin\u0027 to be teached.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Old your row,\" squeaked Isaiah, that being the shrill boy\u0027s name. \"Five bob, and dear at that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Tibsey snorted, and her garments--a tartan shawl and a brown wincey--shook with wrath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lor a mussy, \u0027ear the brat,\" she said, lifting up her fat hands; \"why, five poun\u0027 wouldn\u0027t buy it noo; don\u0027t be \u0027ard on me, my lovey--me as \u0027ave popped everythink with you, includin\u0027 four silver spoons, a kittle, a girdiron, an\u0027 a coal-scuttle; don\u0027t be \u0027ard, ducky; say ten an\u0027 a tizy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Five bob,\" returned the immovable Isaiah.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You Jewesis is the cuss of hus hall,\" cried Mrs. Tibsey, whacking the counter with a woefully ragged umbrella. \"You cheats an\u0027 you swindles like wipers, an\u0027 I \u0027ates the sight of your \u0027ook noses, I do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ll \u0027ave the boss out,\" said Isaiah, in a high voice, like a steam whistle, to which Mrs. Tibsey replied in a rolling bass, a duet which grew wilder and wilder till the sudden opening of the green baize door reduced them both to silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An old man appeared--such a little old man--very much bent, and dressed in a greasy old ulster which covered him right down to his ragged carpet slippers. He had white hair and beard, piercing black eyes under shaggy white eyebrows, sharply-cut features, and a complexion like dirty parchment, seared all over with innumerable lines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You again?\" he said, in a feeble Jewish voice. \"Oh, you devil!--you--you--\" here a fit of coughing seized him, and he contented himself with glaring at Mrs. Tibsey, upon which he was immediately confronted by that indomitable female, who seized the teapot and shook it in his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Five bob!\" she shrieked; \"five bob for this!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Too much--far too much,\" said Lazarus in dismay; \"say four, my dear, four.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ten; I want ten,\" said Mrs. Tibsey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no; four; you say ten, but you mean four.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say six.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Four.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then take it,\" said Mrs. Tibsey, clashing it down in wrath, \"and the devil take you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All in good time--all in good time,\" chuckled the old man, and disappeared through the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You see, you oughter \u0027ave taken the five,\" sniggered Isaiah, making out the pawnticket. \"There\u0027s four bob, don\u0027t spend it in drink.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me drink, you hugly himp,\" said the lady, sweeping the money into her capacious pocket, where it reposed in company with an empty gin bottle; \"me drink, as takes in washin\u0027 and goes hout nussin\u0027, an\u0027 was quite the lady afore I fell into the company of wipers: me dr-- well,\" and, language failing her, Mrs. Tibsey sailed majestically out of the shop, coming into collision with Ezra and Keith, who were just entering.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A whirlwind in petticoats,\" said Keith, startled by this ragged apparition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Askin\u0027 your parding, gents both,\" said Mrs. Tibsey, dropping a very shaky curtsey, \"but a young limb h\u0027insides bin puttin\u0027 my back hup like the wrigglin\u0027 heel \u0027e h\u0027are, and if you\u0027re goin\u0027 to pop anythink, don\u0027t let it be a silver teapot, \u0027cause old Sating h\u0027inside is the cuss of orphens and widders,\" and, having relieved her mind, Mrs. Tibsey flounced indignantly away to refresh herself with her favourite beverage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Complimentary to your parent,\" observed Keith, as they entered the shop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, they\u0027re much worse sometimes,\" said Ezra complacently. \"Isaiah, where\u0027s my father?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In \u0027is room,\" replied Isaiah, resuming the reading of a sporting newspaper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra opened the green baize door without knocking, and entered, followed by Keith. A small square room, even dingier than the shop. At one side a truckle bed pushed up against the wall, and next to it a large iron safe. A rusty grate, with a starved-looking fire, had an old battered kettle simmering on its hob. At the back a square dirty-paned window, through which the light fell on a small table covered with greasy green cloth, and piled up with papers. At this table sat old Lazarus, mumbling over some figures. He looked up suddenly when the young men entered, and cackled a greeting to his son, after which effort he was seized with a violent fit of coughing, which seemed to shake him to pieces. The paroxysm having passed, he began to talk in his feeble, Jewish voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He, he! my dear,\" looking sharply at Keith, \"is this the young man you spoke of? Well, well--too good-looking, my dear--the women--ah, the women, devil take \u0027em, they\u0027ll be turning his head.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s his own business, not yours,\" said Ezra curtly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He, he! but it is my business--they\u0027ll love him, and love means presents--that means money--my money--I can\u0027t trust him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s rather severe, isn\u0027t it?\" said Keith, speaking for the first time. \"You can\u0027t tell a man\u0027s character altogether by his face--good looks do not invariably mean libertine principles.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah! I know, I know!\" muttered Lazarus, rubbing his hands together; \"well, well, can you keep books?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I have been accustomed to do so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you honest?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keith laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m generally considered so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He, he! that\u0027s not saying much. What wages do you want?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Three pounds a week,\" said Stewart modestly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, my dear, my dear, what a large sum; say two, my dear, two pounds, or forty shillings, it\u0027s very large; you can save out of two pounds.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m glad you think so,\" said Keith dryly. \"I\u0027ve got my doubts on the subject; however, beggars must not be choosers, so I agree.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"On trial, mind on trial,\" muttered the old man cautiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m quite agreeable,\" replied Keith complacently, hoping that by the time his trial is over he would be on the staff of some paper. \"What are the hours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nine, my dear,\" said Lazarus, stroking his beard, \"nine till six, with half-an-hour for something to eat in the day--a bun and a cup of coffee--don\u0027t be extravagant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t very well be, on such a salary,\" replied Stewart. \"Well, Mr. Lazarus, as it\u0027s all settled, I\u0027ll come at nine o\u0027clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes! yes! quite right; but no horse-racing, no gambling, no women--they\u0027re the devil, my dear, the devil.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re rather hard on the sex, father,\" said Ezra satirically, \"considering how useful they are to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aha! quite right, quite right,\" chuckled the old man. \"Oh, I know fine ladies; they come to old Lazarus for money--to sell diamonds--ah, my dear, there\u0027s lots of diamonds in that safe, he, he!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder you\u0027re not afraid of being robbed,\" said Keith.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old man looked up with a sudden gleam of suspicion in his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no; I keep the keys under my pillow, and I\u0027ve got a pistol. I can fire it, oh, yes, I can fire it, then the neighbours, my dear, all round; oh, I\u0027m quite safe--yes, yes, quite safe; no one would hurt old Lazarus. How\u0027s Esther, my dear?\" turning suddenly to his son.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Esther was the girl to whom Ezra was engaged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, she\u0027s all right,\" he replied. \"I took her the other night to see Caprice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aha!\" cried old Lazarus, lifting up his hands. \"Oh, dear, dear, what a woman. I know her, oh, I know her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Personally?\" asked Keith, whereupon Mr. Lazarus suddenly became deaf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, yes, a fine woman; ruins everybody, ruins \u0027em body and soul, and laughs at \u0027em, like the fiend she is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra looked at his paternal relative in disgust, and took Keith\u0027s arm. \"Come along,\" he said, \"I\u0027ve got an engagement.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good boy, good boy,\" muttered his parent, nodding his head, \"make money, my dear, make--\" here another fit of coughing interrupted him, and Ezra hurried Keith away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Faugh!\" said Ezra, lifting up his hat when they were in the street; \"how I hate the miasma of that place. It\u0027s like the upas tree, and kills all who come within its circle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think your father knows Caprice?\" asked Keith, as they walked down Bourke Street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t tell you,\" answered Lazarus coolly; \"I shouldn\u0027t be surprised--he knows half the women in Melbourne. When a spendthrift wants money, he goes to my father; when a woman is in trouble, she goes there also; in spite of her lovers, Caprice is such an extravagant woman, that I\u0027ve no doubt she\u0027s had dealings with my father. If the secret life of Lazarus the pawnbroker were only written, it would be very interesting, I assure you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m glad I got the place,\" said Keith thoughtfully; \"it isn\u0027t much, but will keep me alive till I get on my feet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are sure to drop into a newspaper appointment,\" replied Ezra, \"and of course I will do my best for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re very good,\" answered Keith gratefully; \"ha, ha, what queer tricks the jade Fortune plays us. I come to Melbourne full of poetic dreams, and find my fate in a pawnbroker\u0027s office--it isn\u0027t romantic, but it\u0027s bread and butter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re not the first poet who has gone to the pawnbroker.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I expect I\u0027m the first that ever went on such good terms,\" retorted Keith shrewdly.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53883.html","bookId":829,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:05:05 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:05:05 AM"}
