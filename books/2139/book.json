Salvatore\u0027s exciting conclusion to The Sellswords Trilogy! The drow mercenary Jarlaxle and his companion, the human assassin Artemis Entreri, have begun to make a home for themselves in the rugged Bloodstone Lands. But not everyone is ready to trust a man who\u0027s spent his life killing for coin, much less a member of a race of subterranean elves known for their fanatical devotion to a demon goddess. If they want to make it out of the Bloodstone Lands alive, they\u0027ll have to learn to trust their enemies, and be suspicious of their friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/road-of-the-patriarch-the-sellswords-3.jpg","author":"R.A.
