Now it was her turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan used a sharp wooden letter opener from his desk to cut himself. Elena always hated to see him do this, use the most efficient implement that would penetrate vampire skin; so she shut her eyes tightly and only looked again when red blood was trickling from a little cut on his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to take a lot - and you shouldn\u0027t,\" Stefan whispered, and she knew he was saying these things while hecould say them. \"I\u0027m not holding you too hard or hurting you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was always so worried. This time,she kissedhim .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she could see how strange he thought it was, that he wanted kisses more than he wanted her to take his blood. Laughing, Elena pushed him flat and hovered over him and went for the general area of the wound again, knowing that he thought she was going to tease him. But instead she fastened herself on the wound like a limpet and sucked hard,hard , until she had made him sayplease with his mind. But she wasn\u0027t satisfied until she made him sayplease out loud as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car, in the dimness, Matt and Meredith thought of the idea at the same time. She was faster, but they spoke almost together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an idiot! Matt, where\u0027s the seatback release?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie, you have to unfold her seat backward! There\u0027s a little handle, you should be able to reach it and pull up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s voice was hitching now, hiccupping. \"My arms - they\u0027re sort of poking into - my arms - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie,\" Meredith said thickly. \"I know you can do it. Matt - is the handle right - under - the front seat or - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. At the edge. One - no, two o\u0027clock.\" Matt didn\u0027t have breath for more. Once he had grabbed the tree, he found that if he loosened pressure for an instant, it pushed harder on his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no choice, he thought. He took as much of a deep breath as he could, pushed back on the branch, hearing a cry from Meredith, andtwisted , feeling jagged splinters like thin wooden knives tear his throat and ear and scalp. Now he was free of the pressure on the back of his neck, although he was appalled by how much more tree there was in the car than the last time he had seen it. His lap was filled with branches; evergreen needles were thickly piled everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Meredith was so mad, he thought dizzily, turning toward her. She was almost buried in branches, one hand wrestling with something at her throat, but she saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt...get...your own seat! Quick! Bonnie, Iknow you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt dug and tore into the branches, then groped for the handle that would collapse the backrest of his seat. The handle wouldn\u0027t move. Thin, tough tendrils were wrapped around it, springy and hard to break. He twisted and snapped them savagely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis seatback dropped away. He ducked under the huge arm-branch - if it still deserved the name, since the car was full of similar huge branches now. Then, just as he reached to help Meredith, her seat abruptly folded back, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell with it, away from the evergreen, gasping for air. For an instant she just lay still. Then she finished scrambling into the backseat proper, dragging a needle-shrouded figure with her. When she spoke, her voice was hoarse and her speech was still slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt. Bless you...for having...this jigsaw puzzle...of a car.\" She kicked the front seat back into position, and Matt did likewise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie,\" Matt said numbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie didn\u0027t move. Many tiny branches were still entwining her, caught in the fabric of her shirt, wound into her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith and Matt both started pulling. Where the branches let go, they left welts or tiny puncture wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost as if they were trying to grow into her,\" Matt said, as a long, thin branch pulled away, leaving bloody pinpricks behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie?\" Meredith said. She was the one disentangling the twigs from Bonnie\u0027s hair. \"Bonnie? Come on, up. Look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shaking began again in Bonnie\u0027s body, but she let Meredith turn her face up. \"I didn\u0027t think I could do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was so scared....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie went on crying quietly against Meredith\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt looked at Meredith just as the map light flickered and went out. The last thing he saw was her dark eyes, which held an expression that made him suddenly feel even sicker to his stomach. He looked out the three windows he could now see from the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have been hard to see anything at all. But what he was looking for was pressed right up against the glass. Needles. Branches. Solid against every inch of the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, he and Meredith, without needing to say anything, each reached for a backseat door handle. The doors clicked, opened a fraction of an inch; then they slammed back hard with a very definitivewham .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith and Matt looked at each other. Meredith looked down again and began to pluck more twigs off Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. A little...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re shaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was cold now. Outside the car, rather than through the once-open window that was now completely plugged with evergreen, Matt could hear the wind. It whistled, as if through many branches. There was also the sound of wood creaking, startlingly loud and ridiculously high above. It sounded like a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What thehell was it, anyway?\" he exploded, kicking the front seat viciously. \"The thing I swerved for on the road?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith\u0027s dark head lifted slowly. \"I don\u0027t know; I was about to roll up the window. I only got a glimpse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just appeared right in the middle of the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t there and then itwas there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves aren\u0027t that color. It was red,\" Bonnie said flatly, lifting her head from Meredith\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red?\" Meredith shook her head. \"It was much too big to be a fox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Itwas red, I think,\" Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves aren\u0027t red...what about werewolves? Does Tyler Smallwood have any relatives with red hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a wolf,\" Bonnie said. \"It was...backward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Backward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Its head was on the wrong side. Or maybe it had heads on both ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie, you arereally scaring me,\" Meredith said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt wouldn\u0027t say it, but she was really scaring him, too. Because his glimpse of the animal had seemed to show him the same kind of deformed shape that Bonnie was describing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we just saw it at a weird angle,\" he said, while Meredith said, \"It may just have been some animal scared out by - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith looked up at the top of the car. Matt followed her gaze. Very slowly, and with a groan of metal, the roof dented. And again. As if something very heavy was leaning on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt cursed himself. \"While I was in the front seat, why didn\u0027t I just floor it - ?\" He stared hungrily through branches, trying to make out the accelerator, the ignition. \"Are the keys still there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, we ended up half in a ditch. And besides, if it would have done any good, I\u0027d have told you to floor it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That branch would\u0027ve taken your head off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Meredith said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would havekilled you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it would have gotten you two out, I\u0027d have suggested it. But you were trapped looking sideways; I couldsee straight ahead. They were already here; the trees. In every direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That...isn\u0027t...possible!\" Matt pounded the seat in front of him to emphasize each word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isthis possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roof creaked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both of you - stop fighting!\" Bonnie said, and her voice broke on a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an explosion like a gunshot and the car sank suddenly back and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie started. \"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...a tire blowing,\" Matt said at last. He didn\u0027t trust his own voice. He looked at Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did Bonnie. \"Meredith - the branches are filling up the front seat. I can hardly see the moonlight. It\u0027s getting dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we going todo ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt could see the tremendous tension and frustration in Meredith\u0027s face, as if everything she said should come out through gritted teeth. But Meredith\u0027s voice was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Stefan still shuddering, Elena curled herself like a cat over the bed. She smiled at him, a smile drugged with pleasure and love. He thought of grasping her by the arms, pulling her down, and starting all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how insane she\u0027d made him. Because he knew - all too well, from experience - the danger they were flirting with. Much more of this and Elena would be the first spirit-vampire, as she\u0027d been the first vampire-spirit he\u0027d known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut look at her! He slipped out from beneath her as he sometimes did and just gazed, feeling his heart pound just at the sight of her. Her hair, true gold, fell like silk down to the bed and pooled there. Her body, in the light of the one small lamp in the room, seemed to be outlined in gold. She truly seemed to float and move and sleep in a golden haze. It was terrifying. For a vampire, it was as if he\u0027d brought a living sun into his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself suppressing a yawn. She did that to him, too, like an unwitting Delilah taking Samson\u0027s strength away. Hyper-charged as he might be by her blood, he was also delightfully sleepy. He would spend a warm night in - or below - her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Matt\u0027s car it only got darker as the trees continued to cut out the moonlight. For a while they tried yelling for help. That did no good, and besides, as Meredith pointed out, they needed to conserve the oxygen in the car. So they sat still again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Meredith reached into her jeans pocket and produced a set of keys with a tiny keychain flashlight. Its light was blue. She pressed it and they all leaned forward. Such a tiny thing to mean so much, Matt thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was pressure against the front seats now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie?\" Meredith said. \"No one will hear us out here yelling. If anyone could hear us, they would have heard the tire and thought it was a gunshot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie shook her head as if she didn\u0027t want to listen. She was still picking pine needles out of her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right. We\u0027re miles away from anybody, Matt thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something very bad here,\" Bonnie said. She said it quietly, but as if every word was being forced out one by one, like pebbles thrown into a pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt suddenly felt grayer. \"How...bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so bad that it\u0027s...I\u0027venever felt anything like this before. Not when Elena got killed, not from Klaus, not fromanything . I\u0027venever feltanything as bad as this. It\u0027sso bad, and it\u0027s sostrong . I didn\u0027t think anything could be so strong. It\u0027spushing on me, and I\u0027mafraid - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith cut her off. \"Bonnie, I know we can both only think of one way out of this - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027sno way out of this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - I know you\u0027re afraid - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is there to call? I could do it...if there were someone to call. I can stare at your little flashlight and try to pretend it\u0027s a flame and do it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trancing?\" Matt looked at Meredith sharply. \"She\u0027s not supposed to do that anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Klaus is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nobody to hear me!\" Bonnie shrieked and then she broke down into huge sobs at last. \"Elena and Stefan are too far away, and they\u0027re probably asleep by now! And there isn\u0027t anyone else!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them were being pushed together now, as branches pressed the seats back onto them. Matt and Meredith were close enough to look at each other right over Bonnie\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh,\" Matt said, startled. \"Um...are we sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Meredith said. She sounded both grim and hopeful. \"Remember this morning? We are not at all sure. In factI\u0027m sure he\u0027s still around somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Matt felt sick, and Meredith and Bonnie looked ill in the already strange-looking blue light. \"And - right before this happened, we were talking about how a lot of stuff - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - basically everything that happened to change Elena - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - was all his fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With an open window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie sobbed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt and Meredith, however, had made a silent agreement by eye contact. Meredith said, very gently, \"Bonnie, what you said you would do; well, you\u0027re going to have to do it. Try to get through to Stefan, or waken Elena or - or apologize to...Damon. Probably the last, I\u0027m afraid. But he\u0027s never seemed to want us all dead, and he must know that it won\u0027t help him with Elena if he kills her friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt grunted, skeptical. \"He may not want us all dead, but he may wait until some of us are dead to save the others. I\u0027ve never trus - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never wished him any harm,\" Meredith overrode him in a louder voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt blinked at her and then shut up. He felt like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, here, the flashlight\u0027s on,\" Meredith said, and even in this crisis, her voice was steady, rhythmic, hypnotic. The pathetic little light was so precious, too. It was all they had to keep the darkness from becoming absolute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the darkness became absolute, Matt thought, it would be because all light, all air, everything from the outside had been shut out, pushed out of the way by the pressure of the trees. And by then the pressure would have broken their skeletons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie?\" Meredith\u0027s voice was the voice of every big sister who ever had come to her younger sibling\u0027s rescue. That gentle. That controlled. \"Can you try to pretend it\u0027s a candle flame...a candle flame...a candle flame...and then try to trance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in trance already.\" Bonnie\u0027s voice was somehow distant - far away and almost echoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then ask for help,\" Meredith said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie was whispering, over and over, clearly oblivious to the world around her: \"Please, come help us. Damon, if you can hear me, please accept our apologies and come. You gave us a terrible scare, and I\u0027m sure we deserved it, but please, please help. It hurts, Damon. It hurts so bad I could scream. But instead I\u0027m putting all that energy into Calling you. Please, please, please help...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor five, ten, fifteen minutes she kept it up, as the branches grew, enclosing them with their sweet, resinous scent. She kept it up far longer than Matt had ever thought she could endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the light went out. After that there was no sound but the whisper of the pines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou had to admire the technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon was once again lounging in midair, even higher this time than when he\u0027d entered Caroline\u0027s third-story window. He still had no idea of the names of trees, but that didn\u0027t stop him. This branch was like having a box seat over the drama unfolding below. He was starting to get a little bored, since nothing new was happening on the ground. He\u0027d abandoned Damaris earlier this evening whenshe had gotten boring, talking about marriage and other subjects he wished to avoid. Like her current husband. Bo-ring. He\u0027d left without really checking to see if she\u0027d become a vampire - he tended to think so, and wouldn\u0027t that be a surprise when hubby got home? His lips trembled on the edge of a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow him, the play had almost reached its climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you really had to admire the technique. Pack hunting. He had no idea what sort of nasty little creatures were manipulating the trees, but like wolves or lionesses, they seemed to have gotten it down to an art. Working together to capture prey that was too quick and too heavily armored for one of them alone to manage. In this case, a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fine art of cooperation. Pity vampires were so solitary, he thought. If we could cooperate, we\u0027d own the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked sleepily and then flashed a dazzling smile at nothing at all. Of course, if we could do that - say, take a city and divvy up the inhabitants - we\u0027d finish it off by divvying up one another. Tooth and nail and Power would be wielded like the blade of a sword, until there was nothing left but shreds of quivering flesh and gutters running with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice imagery, though, he thought, and let his eyelids droop to appreciate it. Artistic. Blood in scarlet pools, magically still liquid enough to run down white marble steps of - oh, say, the Kallimarmaron in Athens. An entire city gone quiet, purged of noisy, chaotic, hypocritical humans, with only their necessary bits left behind: a few arteries to pump the sweet red stuff out in quantity. The vampire version of the land of milk and honey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes again in annoyance. Now things were getting loud down there. Humans yelling. Why? What was the point? The rabbit always squeals in the jaws of the fox, but when has another rabbit ever rushed up to save it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, a new proverb,and proof that humans are as stupid as rabbits, he thought, but his mood was ruined. His mind slid away from the fact, but it wasn\u0027t just the noise below that was disturbing him. Milk and honey, that had been...a mistake. Thinking about that had been a blunder. Elena\u0027s skin had been like milk that night a week ago, warm-white, not cool, even in the moonlight. Her bright hair in shadow had been like spilled honey. Elena wouldn\u0027t be happy to see the results of this night\u0027s pack hunting. She would cry tears like crystal dewdrops, and they would smell like salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Damon stiffened. He sent one stealthy query of Power around him, a circle of radar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing bounced back, except the mindless trees at his feet. Whatever was orchestrating this, it was invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight, then. Let\u0027s trythis , he thought: Concentrating on all the blood he\u0027d drunk in the last few days, he blasted out a wash of pure Power, like Vesuvius erupting with a deadly pyroclastic explosion. It encircled him completely in every direction, a fifty-mile-per-hour bubble of Power like superheated gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was back. Unbelievably, the parasite was trying to do it again, to get into his mind. It had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLulling him, he supposed, rubbing the back of his neck with absentminded fury, while its packmates finished off their prey in the car. Whispering things into his mind to keep him still, taking his own dark thoughts and echoing them back a shade or two darker, in a cycle that might have ended in him flying off to kill and kill again for the pure black velvet enjoyment of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Damon\u0027s mind was cold and dark with fury. He stood, stretching his aching arms and shoulders, and then searched carefully, not with a simple radar ring, but with a blast of Power behind each stab, probing with his mind to find the parasite. It had to be out there; the trees were still going about their business. But he could find nothing, even though he\u0027d used the fastest and most efficient method of scanning he knew: a thousand random stabs per second in a Drunkard\u0027s Walk search pattern. He should have found a dead body immediately. Instead he\u0027d foundnothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made him even angrier than before, but there was a tinge of excitement to his fury. He\u0027d wanted a fight; a chance to kill where the killing would be meaningful. And now here was an opponent who met all the qualifications - and Damon couldn\u0027t kill it because he couldn\u0027t find it. He sent a message, lambent with ferocity, in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have already warned you once. Now ICHALLENGEyou. Show yourself - OR ELSE STAY AWAY FROM ME!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gathered Power, gathered it, gathered it again, thinking of all the different mortals who had contributed it. He held it, nurturing it, crafting it for its purpose, and raising its strength with all that his mind knew of fighting and of the skill and expertise of war. He held the Power until it felt as if he were holding a nuclear bomb in his arms. And then he let it go all at once, an explosion speeding in the opposite direction, away from him, nearing the speed of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, surely, he would feel the death throes of something enormously powerful and cunning - something that had managed to survive his previous strafings designed only for eldritch creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon expanded his senses to their widest reach, waiting to hear or feel something shattering, combusting - something falling blind, with its own blood tumbling nearby, from a branch, from the air, fromsomewhere . Fromsomewhere a creature should have plummeted to the ground or raked at it with huge dinosaur-like claws - a creature half-paralyzed and completely doomed, cooked from the inside out. But although he could feel the wind rising to a howl and huge black clouds pooling above him in response to his own mood, he still could sense no dark creature close enough to have entered his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strong was this thing? Where was it coming from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust for a moment, a thought flashed through his mind. A circle. A circle with a dot at its center. And the circle was the blast he\u0027d shot away in all directions, and the dot was the only place his blast didn\u0027t reach. Inside him alre -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap! Suddenly his thoughts went blank. And then he began, sluggishly, slightly bewildered, to try to put the fractured pieces together. He had been thinking about the blast of Power he\u0027d sent out, yes? And how he\u0027d expected to feel something fall and die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, he couldn\u0027t even sense any ordinary animals bigger than a fox in the woods. Although his sweep of Power had been carefully made to affect only creatures of his kind of darkness, the ordinary animals had been so spooked that they\u0027d gone running wildly from the area. He peered down. Hm. Except the trees around the car; and they weren\u0027t after him. Besides, whatever they were, they were only the pawns of an invisible killer. Not really sentient - not within the boundaries he had crafted so carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he have been wrong? Half his fury had been for himself, for being so careless, so well-fed and confident that he\u0027d let down his guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell-fed...hey, maybe I\u0027m drunk, he thought, and flashed the smile again at nothing, without even thinking about it. Drunk and paranoid and edgy. Pissed and pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon relaxed against the tree. The wind was screaming now, swirling and freezing, the sky full of roiling black clouds that cut out any light from the moon or stars. Just his kind of weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still edgy, but he couldn\u0027t find any reason to be. The only disturbance in the aura of the woods was the tiny crying of a mind inside the car, like a trapped bird with only one note. That would be the little one, the redheaded witch with the delicate neck. The one who\u0027d been whining about life changing too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon gave a little more of his weight to the tree. He\u0027d followed the car with his mind out of absent interest. It wasn\u0027t his fault that he\u0027d caught them talking about him, but it did degrade their chances of rescue a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd that they\u0027d had an accident trying not to run over a creature in approximately the same area he\u0027d almost crashed the Ferrari trying to run one over. Pity he hadn\u0027t had a glimpse of their creature, but the trees were too thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redheaded bird was crying again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, do you want a changenow or don\u0027t you, little witch? Make up your mind. You have to ask nicely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, of course,I have to decide what kind of change you get. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-11.html","bookId":2035,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:14 PM"}
