Dant, Old Taylor, Old Forester, Old Fitzgerald, Maker\u0027s Mark, Wild Turkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach name rang a bell. I can walk past saloons all over town and remember what I drank there. I may be less clear on what brought me there or whom I drank with, but I\u0027ll recall what was in my glass, and what bottle it came from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntique Age. Old Grand Dad. Old Crow. Early Times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked the names, and especially the last. Early Times. It sounded like a toast. \"Well, here\u0027s to crime.\" \"Absent friends.\" \"Early Times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly Times indeed. They got better the more of a distance you looked back at them from. But what didn\u0027t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Early Times,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fifth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pint\u0027ll be enough,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped the bottle into a brown paper bag, twisted the top, handed it over the counter to me. I dropped it into a pocket of my topcoat and dug a bill out of my wallet. He rang the sale, counted out change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne drink\u0027s too many, they say, and a thousand\u0027s not enough. But a pint would do. For starters, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a liquor store right across the street from my hotel, and I couldn\u0027t guess how many times I went in and out of it during the drinking years. This store, though, was a few blocks away on Eighth Avenue, and the walk back to the Northwestern seemed endless. I felt as though people were staring at me on the street. Maybe they were. Maybe the expression on my face was the sort to draw stares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went straight up to my room and bolted the door once I was inside it. I took the pint of bourbon from my coat pocket and laid it down on the top of my dresser. I hung my coat in the closet, draped my suit jacket over the back of a chair. I went over to the dresser and picked up the bottle and felt its familiar shape through the brown paper wrapping, and weighed it in my hands. I put it back down, still unwrapped, and went over to look out the window. Downstairs, across Fifty-seventh Street, a man in a topcoat like mine was entering the liquor store. Maybe he\u0027d come out with a pint of Early Times and take it back to his room, and look out his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to unwrap the damn thing. I could open the window and pitch it out. Maybe I could take aim, and try to drop it on someone who looked as though he just got out of church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the TV on, looked at it without seeing it, turned it off. I walked over to the dresser and took the bottle out of the paper bag. I put it back on the dresser but I stood it upright this time, then crumpled the paper bag and dropped it in the wastebasket. I returned to my chair and sat down again. From where I was sitting I couldn\u0027t see the bottle on top of the dresser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack when I was first getting sober I\u0027d made Jan a promise. \"Promise me you won\u0027t take that first drink without calling me,\" she said, and I\u0027d promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny the things you think of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I couldn\u0027t call her now. She was out of town, and I\u0027d ordered her not to tell anyone where she\u0027d gone. Not even me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless she hadn\u0027t left. I\u0027d had a call from her the day before, but what did that prove? The connection, now that I thought about it, had been crystal clear. She might have been in the next room from the sound of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFailing that, she could have been on Lispenard Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she do that? Convinced that the danger was largely in my mind, would she have stayed in her loft and lied to me about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I decided, she wouldn\u0027t do that. Still, there was no reason I could think of not to call her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dialed, got her machine. Was there anyone left in the world who didn\u0027t have one of those damned things? I listened to the same message she\u0027d had on there for years, and when it ended I said, \"Jan, it\u0027s Matt. Pick up if you\u0027re there, will you?\" I waited a moment while the machine went on taping the silence, and then I said, \"It\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer, and I hung up. Well, of course she hadn\u0027t answered. She was miles away. She wouldn\u0027t have played it dishonest. If she\u0027d decided to stay in the city, she\u0027d have told me so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0027d kept my promise. I\u0027d made the call. Not my fault there was nobody home, was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that it was. My fault, that is. It was my warning that got her in a cab to the airport, and it was my actions years ago, long before I met her, that made the trip necessary. My fault. Jesus, was there one thing in the fucking world that wasn\u0027t my fault?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, and the pint of Early Times was on the dresser, with light from the overhead fixture glinting off its shoulder. I went over and picked up the bottle and read its label. It was eighty proof. All of the popular-priced bourbons had been eighty-six proof for years, and then some marketing genius had come up with the idea of cutting the proof to eighty and leaving the price unchanged. Since the federal excise tax is based on alcohol content, and since alcohol costs the manufacturer more than plain water, the distiller increased his profit while slightly boosting the demand at the same time, since dedicated drinkers had to swill down more of the product in order to get the same effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the bonded bourbons were still a hundred proof. And some of the brands came in at odd figures. Jack Daniel\u0027s was ninety proof. Wild Turkey was 101.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny what sticks in your mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should have picked up a fifth, or even a quart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the bottle down and walked over to the window again. I felt curiously calm, and at the same time I was all hyped up. I looked out across the street, then turned and looked at the bottle again. I switched on the TV and clicked the dial from channel to channel, not even noticing what I was looking at. I went around the dial two or three times and turned the set off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. I stood there for a moment, looking at it as though I couldn\u0027t figure out what it was, or what to do about it. It rang again. I let it ring a third time before I picked it up and said hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, this is Tom Havlicek.\" It took me a moment to place the name, and I got it just as he added, \"In Massillon. Beautiful downtown Massillon, isn\u0027t that what they say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid they? I didn\u0027t know how to respond to that, but fortunately I didn\u0027t have to. He said, \"I just thought I\u0027d give you a call, find out what kind of progress you were making.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat progress, I thought. Every couple of days he kills somebody. The NYPD doesn\u0027t have a clue what\u0027s going on, and I stand around with my thumb up my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I said was, \"Well, you know how it goes. It\u0027s a slow process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to tell me. I guess that\u0027s one thing\u0027s the same the whole world over. You put the puzzle together a piece at a time.\" He cleared his throat. \"Why I called, I might have a piece of the puzzle. There\u0027s a night clerk at a motel on Railway Avenue who recognized your sketch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he happen to see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She. Little bitty woman, looks like your grandmother and has a mouth on her would shame a sailor. She took one look at him and knew him right away. Only problem was matching him to the right registration card, but she found him. He didn\u0027t call himself Motley. No surprise there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert Cole is what he put down. That\u0027s not far from the alias you said he used in New York. You had it written down on the sketch but I don\u0027t have it handy. Ronald something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ronald Copeland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. For address he put a post-office box, and he put down Iowa City, Iowa. He had a car, and he put down the plate number, and the motor vehicles people in Des Moines tell me there\u0027s no such plate been issued. They say they couldn\u0027t issue such a plate because it doesn\u0027t jibe with their numbering system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so,\u0027\u0027 he said. \"Now my thinking is either he just made up the plate number or he used the one on the car he was driving, but it wasn\u0027t an Iowa tag in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure. To take it the rest of the way, if he drove from New York he most likely had New York plates, and he might want to put down the correct plate number just in case some sharp-eyed clerk compared his car with the card he filled out. So if you were to check motor vehicles there at your end-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea,\" I said. He gave me the plate number and I copied it down, along with the name Robert Cole. \"He used an Iowa address at a local hotel here,\" I remembered. \"Mason City, though. Not Iowa City. I wonder why he\u0027s fixated on Iowa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s from there originally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. He sounds like a New Yorker. Maybe he locked with somebody from Iowa in Dannemora. Tom, how did the motel clerk get to see the sketch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did she get to see it? I showed it to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought the case wasn\u0027t going to be reopened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t,\" he said. \"Still hasn\u0027t been.\" He was silent for a moment. Then he said, \"What I do on my free time\u0027s pretty much up to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ran all over town on your own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat again. \"Matter of fact,\" he said, \"I found a couple of the fellows to help out. I was the one who showed the sketch to that woman, but that was just the luck of the draw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what good all of this is, Matt, but I thought you ought to know what showed up so far. I don\u0027t know where we go from here, if anywheres, but you\u0027ll hear from me if anything else turns up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up and went over to the window again. On the street a couple of uniforms were in conversation with a street vendor, a black man who\u0027d set up shop a few weeks ago in front of the florist\u0027s, selling scarves and belts and purses, and cheap umbrellas when it rained. They come over from Dakar on Air Afrique, stay five and six to a room in the Broadway hotels, and fly back to Senegal every few months with presents for the kids. They learn quick over here, and evidently their curriculum includes low-level bribery, because the two blues left this one to tend his open-air store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice of Havlicek, I thought. Decent of him, putting in his own time on a case his chief wouldn\u0027t reopen, even getting some other cops to work some of their off-hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all the good it would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at the bottle and let it draw me across the room to the dresser. The federal tax stamp ran from one shoulder to the other, so arranged that you\u0027d tear it when you twisted the cap. I teased the edges of the stamp with the ball of my thumb. I picked up the bottle and held it to the light, looking at the overhead bulb through the amber liquid the way you\u0027re supposed to view an eclipse through a piece of smoked glass. That was what whiskey was, I\u0027d sometimes thought. The filter through which you can safely look upon a reality that\u0027s otherwise too vivid for the naked eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the bottle down, made a phone call. A gruff bass voice said, \"Faber Printing, this is Jim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Matt,\" I said. \"How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so bad. And you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I can\u0027t complain. Say, I didn\u0027t catch you at a bad time, did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s a slow day. What I\u0027m doing right now is running carry-out menus for a Chinese restaurant. They buy thousands of them at a time and their deliverymen leave stacks of them in every vestibule and hallway they can find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re printing litter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m doing,\" he said cheerfully. \"Contributing what I can to the solid-waste disposal problem. And you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, nothing much. It\u0027s a slow day.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-29.html","bookId":2326,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM"}
