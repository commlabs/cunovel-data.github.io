What would you ever use it for outside of murder? People didn\u0027t have iceboxes any more, didn\u0027t have blocks of ice brought by the iceman. They filled trays with water to make ice cubes, or had a gadget in their refrigerator that produced the cubes automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refrigerator in Syosset had had an automatic ice maker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere did you get an icepick? How much did they cost? I was suddenly full of icepick questions. I walked around, found a five-and-ten, asked a clerk in the housewares department where I\u0027d find an icepick. She shunted me to the hardware department, where another clerk told me they didn\u0027t carry icepicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess they\u0027re out of date,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bother to answer. I walked around some more, stopped at a storefront that sold hardware and kitchen things. The fellow behind the counter was wearing a camel-hair cardigan and chewing the stub of a cigar. I asked if he carried icepicks and he turned without a word and came back with one stapled to a piece of cardboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ninety-eight cents,\" he said. \"Is one-oh-six with the tax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really want it. I had just wondered at price and availability. I paid for it anyway. Outside I stopped at a wire trash basket and discarded the brown paper bag and the piece of cardboard and examined my purchase. The blade was four or five inches long, the point sharp. The handle was a cylinder of dark wood. I held it alternately in one hand and then the other, dropped it back in my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into the store. The man who\u0027d sold it to me looked up from his magazine. \"I just bought that icepick from you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something wrong with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine. You sell many of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t keep track,\" he said. \"Sell one now and then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do people buy them for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me the guarded look you get when people begin to wonder about your sanity. \"Whatever they want,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t guess they pick their teeth with \u0027em, but anything else they want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You been here long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had this store a long time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, left. I didn\u0027t ask him who\u0027d bought an icepick from him nine years ago. If I had, he wouldn\u0027t have been the only one doubting my sanity. But if someone had asked him that question right after Barbara Ettinger was killed, if someone had asked him and every other housewares and hardware dealer in that part of Brooklyn, and if they\u0027d shown around the appropriate photographs and asked a few other appropriate questions, maybe they would have come up with Barbara\u0027s killer then and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reason to do so. No reason to think it was anything but what it looked like, another score for the Icepick Prowler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked around, my hand gripping the butt end of the icepick in my pocket. Handy little thing. You couldn\u0027t slash with it, you could only stab, but it would still do a pretty good job on someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it legal to carry it? The law classified it not as a deadly weapon but as a dangerous instrument. Deadly weapons are things like loaded guns, switch knives, gravity knives, daggers, billies, blackjacks and brass knuckles, articles with no function but murderous assault. An icepick had other uses, though the man who sold it hadn\u0027t managed to tell me any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, that didn\u0027t mean you could carry it legally. A machete\u0027s a dangerous instrument in the eyes of the law, not a deadly weapon, but you\u0027re not allowed to carry one through the streets of New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the thing out of my pocket a couple of times and looked at it. Somewhere along the way I dropped it through a sewer grating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the icepick used on Barbara Ettinger vanished the same way? It was possible. It was even possible that it had been dropped down that very sewer grating. All kinds of things were possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was getting worse instead of better. I stopped for another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost track of the time. At one point I looked at my watch and it was twenty-five minutes of four. I remembered that I was supposed to meet Lynn London at four o\u0027clock. I didn\u0027t see how I could get there on time. Still, she was in Chelsea, it wouldn\u0027t take all that long-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I caught myself. What was I worrying about? Why break my neck to keep an appointment when she wouldn\u0027t be keeping it herself? Because her father would have talked to her, either early that morning or late the night before, and she\u0027d know by now that there\u0027d been a change in the London family policy. Matthew Scudder was no longer representing the best interests of the Londons. He was persisting in his folly for reasons of his own, and perhaps he had the right to do this, but he couldn\u0027t count on the cooperation of Charles London or his schoolmarm daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, met the warm brown eyes of the bartender. \"Just talking to myself,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothin\u0027 wrong with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked his attitude. \"Might as well give me another,\" I said. \"And take something for yourself while you\u0027re at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Jan twice from Brooklyn and her line was busy both times. When I got back to Manhattan I called her again from Armstrong\u0027s and got another busy signal. I finished a cup of coffee with a shot in it and tried her again and the line was still busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the operator check the line. She came back and told me the receiver was off the hook. There\u0027s a way they can make the phone ring even if you\u0027ve taken it off the hook, and I thought about identifying myself as a policeman and getting her to do that, but decided to let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no right to interrupt the woman. Maybe she was asleep. Maybe she had company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there was a man there, or a woman. It was no business of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething settled in my stomach and glowed there like a hot coal. I had another cup of bourbon-flavored coffee to drown it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening hurried on by. I didn\u0027t really pay it too much attention. My mind tended to drift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had things to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point I found myself on the phone, dialing Lynn London\u0027s number. No answer. Well, she\u0027d told me she had tickets for a concert. And I couldn\u0027t remember why I was calling her, anyway. I\u0027d already decided there was no point. That was why I\u0027d missed my appointment with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she\u0027d have shown up herself. Would have left me standing there, feeling stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I called Jan again. Still busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about going over there. Wouldn\u0027t take too long by cab. But what was the point? When a woman takes her phone off the hook it\u0027s not because she\u0027s hoping you\u0027ll come knock on her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBACK at the bar, somebody was talking about the First Avenue Slasher. I gathered he was still at large. One of the surviving victims had described how the man had attempted to start a conversation with him before showing his weapon and attacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the little article I\u0027d read about muggers asking you the time or directions. Don\u0027t talk to strangers, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the trouble with this place tonight,\" I said. \"Too many strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of people looked at me. From behind the bar, Billie asked me if I was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I assured him. \"Just that it\u0027s too crowded tonight. No room to breathe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a good night to turn in early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t feel like turning in, just like getting the hell out of there. I went around the corner to McGovern\u0027s and had a quick one. The place was dead so I didn\u0027t hang around. I hit Polly\u0027s Cage across the street and left when the jukebox started getting on my nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air outside was bracing. It struck me that I\u0027d been drinking all day and that it added up to a hell of a lot of booze, but I seemed to be handling it fine. It wasn\u0027t affecting me at all. I was wide awake, clear-minded, clear-headed. It\u0027d be hours before I\u0027d be able to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI circled the block, stopped at a hole in the wall on Eighth Avenue, stopped again at Joey Farrell\u0027s. I felt restless and combative and got out of there when the bartender said something that irritated me. I don\u0027t remember what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I was walking. I was on Ninth Avenue across the street from Armstrong\u0027s, walking south, and there was something hanging in the air that was putting me on my guard. Even as I was wondering at the feeling, a young man stepped out of a doorway ten yards ahead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a cigarette in one hand. As I approached he moved purposefully into my path and asked me for a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s how the bastards do it. One stops you and sizes you up. The other moves in behind you, and you get a forearm across the windpipe, a knife at your throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t smoke but I generally have a pack of matches in my pocket. I cupped my hands, scratched a match. He tucked the unlit cigarette between his lips and leaned forward, and I flipped the burning match in his face and went in under it, grabbing and shoving hard, sending him reeling into the brick wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whirled myself, ready for his partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nobody behind me. Nothing but an empty street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made it simpler. I kept turning, and I was facing him when he came off the wall with his eyes wide and his mouth open. He was my height but lighter in build, late teens or early twenties, uncombed dark hair and a face white as paper in the light of the streetlamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved in quick and hit him in the middle. He swung at me and I sidestepped the punch and hit him again an inch or two above his belt buckle. That brought his hands down and I swung my right forearm in an arc and hit him in the mouth with my elbow. He drew back and clapped both hands to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Turn around and grab that wall! Come on, you fucker. Get your hands on the wall!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said I was crazy, that he hadn\u0027t done anything. The words came out muffled through the hands he was holding to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he turned around and grabbed the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved in, hooked a foot in front of his, drew his foot back so that he couldn\u0027t come off the wall in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t do nothing,\" he said. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him to put his head against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I did was ask you for a match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him to shut up. I frisked him and he stood still for it. A little blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. Nothing serious. He was wearing one of those leather jackets with a pile collar and two big pockets in front. Bomber jackets, I think they call them. The pocket on the left held a wad of Kleenex and a pack of Winston Lights. The other pocket held a knife. A flick of my wrist and the blade dropped into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gravity knife. One of the seven deadly weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just carry it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From who? Little old ladies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a wallet off his hip. He had ID that indicated he was Anthony Sforczak and he lived in Woodside, Queens. I said, \"You\u0027re a long ways from home, Tony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had two tens and some singles in his wallet. In another pants pocket I found a thick roll of bills secured by a rubber band, and in the breast pocket of his shirt, under the leather jacket, I found one of those disposable butane lighters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s out of fluid,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flicked it. Flame leaped from it and I showed it to him. The heat rose and he jerked his head to the side. I released the thumbcatch and the flame died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was out before. Wouldn\u0027t light.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-17.html","bookId":2322,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM"}
