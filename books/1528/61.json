Gray vaulted over the collapsed pile of beams and sprinted for the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he reached the slit of sunlight, Nicolas screamed at him. “You’ve not won, you svoloch! Millions will still die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had no time to question him. He shoved into the crack and wormed between the squeezing walls, concrete on one side, steel on the other. The vault was a dozen yards thick. He scooted as fast as he could. Still the pressure began to squeeze his chest, trying to hold him for the final crush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took one last breath and exhaled all his air, collapsing his chest. He shoved the last few feet and fell out of the crack with a great gasp of air, landing on his hands and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike being born a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, he missed a figure standing off to the side of the hangar. She slipped into the crack as he vacated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned. “Elena! No! You’ll never make it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled to his feet and lunged for her. But she had already slid deep into the crack, deeper than he could follow with his larger form. She moved swiftly, her lithe figure fading farther and farther away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray prayed she’d make it safely to the other side, but it was still certain death. Only then did he note the long smear of blood trailing into the narrowing crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growled voice spoke behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Elena?” Kowalski asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray watched her vanish out of the crack. He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski stared up and down the side of the hangar. “She left me up there. After she dropped that anchor on that bastard. Said she was coming down here to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned away. “I think that’s where she’s headed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas lay on his back, his legs weighted under a half ton of steel beams. Through a haze of agony, he heard footsteps stumbling toward him. He turned his head. Elena came up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes winced with a pain deeper than any broken bones. “Oh, milaya moya, what are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood soaked through her shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lubov moya…,” he said with a mix of pain and protectiveness. He lifted an arm, and she fell into his embrace. He held her and rocked her gently as the last of the sunlight squeezed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA commanding grind of steel on concrete sounded with a note of finality as the Shelter sealed. A few moments later, a crumbling crash echoed as the far side of the Sarcophagus collapsed. The concussion charges had worked as planned, but the Shelter was already closed tight around it, sparing those outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t so lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas stared up at the lighted archway. The inner steel surfaces were all lined by a thick coat of polycarbonate, all the better to reflect radiation and hold it inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it mattered, but Nicolas lifted the flap of the dosimeter badge secured to his jacket pocket. The surface had been white when he’d put it on this morning. It was now solid black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let it go and reached another arm to cradle Elena better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many questions buried in that one word. Why had Elena betrayed him? Nicolas knew she must have. Nothing else made sense. But also why did she come back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena did not answer. He shifted and saw the glaze to her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so was he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what end awaited him. He had lived his professional life exploring such deaths. It would be as agonizing as it was humiliating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he cradled Elena closer to him, something slipped from her hand and landed on his leg. He reached out and grabbed this last gift from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have collected it from the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why she had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo say good-bye and to offer him a way to escape with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nestled into her and kissed her cold lips one last time. “Ty moyo solnyshko…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was indeed his sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding her, he raised the gun to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd took his escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeptember 7, 11:00 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern Ural Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a rifle over his shoulder, Monk climbed the last switchback of the road. Ahead, the mining complex clustered in front of a granite cliff face. The metal outbuildings and old powerhouse had all oxidized. Roofs and gutters dripped icicles of rust, windows were broken or shuttered, and corroded equipment lay where they’d been dropped decades ago: shovels, picks, wheelbarrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff by the cliffs rose tall mounds of old mine tailings and waste rock dumps. Amid the stone piles rose the tower of a tipple, with its loading booms, hoists, and various chutes used to tip ore ears and unload them into trucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monk limped on his hastily bandaged leg, he wondered how he knew so much about a mining operation. Had his family been involved—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head suddenly jangled through a series of flashbulb-popping images: an older man in coveralls, coated in coal dust…the same man in a coffin…a woman crying…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn electrical stab of pain ended the flickering bits of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWincing, he led the children and Marta through a maze of conveyor belts, ore car tracks, and dump chutes toward their goal. A pair of rails led to a gaping opening in a cliff face. It was the main entrance to the mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they crossed, Monk looked over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLake Karachay spread below. Monk estimated it was two miles across the width here, and three times as long. He searched the forested mountains on the far side, looking for any evidence of where they’d started this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We must hurry,” Konstantin reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk nodded. The older boy walked between the two younger children. Marta trailed. He led them toward the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he neared, he discovered a problem. A large wooden barrier, constructed of stacked and mortared wooden logs, blocked the mine shaft from floor to roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the condition of the complex outside, it looked as if no one had been here in ages. But Monk spotted a pile of cigarette butts and empty vodka bottles at the foot of the barrier. Fresh boot prints covered the sandy floor. The mine below was not as abandoned as it appeared. Someone had been taking a break here recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk glanced behind him. There were no parked trucks or recent tire tracks crossing the complex, so whoever had been lounging here had left by another means. Konstantin had already described that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn underground train crossed under the lake from Mine Complex 337 below to Chelyabinsk 88. Whoever labored in the mines must ordinarily exit out the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk prayed they would not be expecting visitors at their back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed to the rectangle of riveted steel set into the barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do we do?” Monk asked. “Knock?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin frowned and crossed to the door. He lifted the latch and pushed. The door swung open, unlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk fumbled his rifle around and pointed it through the door. “Warn a guy before you do that!” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one comes here,” Konstantin said. “Too dangerous. So no need for keys. Only sealed to keep bears and wolves away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the stray tiger,” Monk mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin dropped his pack, opened it, and fished out their flashlight. He passed it to Monk, who shouldered his rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDucking through the door in the main tunnel, Monk pointed his flashlight. Massive wooden beams shored up the passageway as it slanted into the mountain. A set of steel tracks headed into the darkness, extending beyond the reach of the flashlight’s glow. Closer at hand, a pair of ore cars rested on the tracks near the barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the way, Monk noted shadowy branching tunnels. He suspected the mountain was honeycombed with shafts and tunnels. No wonder the current miners occasionally wandered up out of the Stygian darkness for a little light, even if it was in the shadow of a poisonous lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk asked for directions as they headed out. “So where to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin kept silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk turned to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy shrugged. “I do not know. All I know is down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk sighed. Well, that was a direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashlight in hand, he descended into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavina noted all the smiling faces. Excited chatter spread among the older children, while the younger ones scurried around, trying to dispense nervous energy. They were in direct contrast to the very youngest among them, those under five and too immature for their implants. Those few remained quiet and detached, demonstrating varying levels of untreated autism: sitting silently, staring vacantly, plagued by repetitive gestures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour teachers sought to organize their sixty or so charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay in your groups!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train waited beyond the open blast doors at the back of Chelyabinsk 88. It would be transporting the children for a short pleasure ride. The young ones were occasionally allowed such a luxury, but today the train was on a one-way trip. It would not be returning, coming to a dead stop at the heart of Operation Saturn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Savina’s shoulders, the old Soviet-era industrial apartments stared down at the children with hollow eyes. The teachers also had the same haunted look despite their bright words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did all of you take your medicine?” a matronly woman called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medicine was a sedative combined with a radiosensitive compound. While excited now, in another hour the children would be drifting into a disassociated slumber. It would ease any anxiety when the charges blew at the far end of the tunnel and initiated Operation Saturn. The first dump of lake water through the heart of the tunnel and its subsequent blast of radiation would transform the radiosensitive compound in the children’s bloodstream into a deadly nerve toxin, killing them instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group had considered simply euthanizing the children via lethal injection, but such an intimate act of killing strained even the most professional detachment. Plus afterward, all the small limp bodies would have had to been hauled, loaded, and transported to the heart of Operation Saturn. The plan was for the radiation, blasting for weeks as the lake drained, to burn the bodies and denature the DNA beyond examination—that is, if anyone ever dared approach the bodies. The radiation levels in the tunnel would defy penetration for decades. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-61.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
