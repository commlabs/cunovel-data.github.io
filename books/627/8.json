Slowly he walked out the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed Terrence, \"take it to the nineteenth story.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give it to Miss Zarves,\" hooted Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have fun on the nineteenth story,\" called Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin stood outside the door to the classroom. He didn\u0027t know where to go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As you know, when the builder built Wayside School, he accidentally built it sideways. But he also forgot to build the nineteenth story. He built the eighteenth and the twentieth, but no nineteenth. He said he was very sorry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was also no Miss Zarves. Miss Zarves taught the class on the nineteenth story. Since there was no nineteenth story, there was no Miss Zarves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And besides that, as if Calvin didn\u0027t have enough problems, there was no note. Mrs. Jewls had never given Calvin the note.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Boy, this is just great,\" thought Calvin. \"Just great! I\u0027m supposed to take a note that I don\u0027t have to a teacher who doesn\u0027t exist, and who teaches on a story that was never built.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 29He didn\u0027t know what to do. He walked down to the eighteenth story, then back up to the twentieth, then back down to the eighteenth, and back up again to the twentieth. There was no nineteenth story. There never was a nineteenth story. And there never will be a nineteenth story.\n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin walked down to the administration office. He decided to put the note in Miss Zarves\u0027s mailbox. But there wasn\u0027t one of those, either. That didn\u0027t bother Calvin too much, however, since he didn\u0027t have a note.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked out the window and saw Louis, the yard teacher, shooting baskets. \"Louis will know what to do,\" he thought. Calvin went outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Louis,\" Calvin called.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi, Calvin,\" said Louis. He tossed him the basketball. Calvin dribbled up and took a shot. He missed. Louis tipped it in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you want to play a game?\" Louis asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t have time,\" said Calvin. \"I have to deliver a note to Miss Zarves up on the nineteenth story.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then what are you doing all the way down here?\" Louis asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no nineteenth story,\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then where is Miss Zarves?\" asked Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no Miss Zarves,\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you going to do with the note?\" asked Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no note,\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I understand,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s good,\" said Calvin, \"because I sure don\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s very simple,\" said Louis. \"You are not supposed to take no notes to no teachers.\n\u003cbr\u003e 30You already haven\u0027t done it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin still didn\u0027t understand. \"I\u0027ll just have to tell Mrs. Jewls that I couldn\u0027t deliver the note,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s good,\" said Louis. \"The truth is always best. Besides, I don\u0027t think I understand what I said, either.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin walked back up the thirty flights of stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you very much, Calvin,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin said, \"But I-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls interrupted him. \"That was a very important note, and I\u0027m glad I was able to count on you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but you see-\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You delivered the note to Miss Zarves on the nineteenth story?\" asked Jason. \"How did you do it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you mean, how did he do it?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"He gave Miss Zarves the note. Some people, Jason, are responsible.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you see, Mrs. Jewls-\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The note was very important,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I told Miss Zarves not to meet me for lunch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t worry,\" said Calvin. \"She won\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I have a coffee can full of Tootsie Roll pops on my desk. You may help yourself to one, for being such a good messenger.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks,\" said Calvin, \"but really, it was nothing.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56814.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
