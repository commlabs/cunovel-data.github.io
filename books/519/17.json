{"id":10426,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. THE GAMBLERS.","content":"The lights were flaring at No. 1 Lytton Avenue, as they seemed to flare almost day and night. The red carpet crossed the pavement; inside the banks of flowers nodded their brilliant heads, there was a rustle of silken drapery and a ripple of laughter from the drawing-room. It was all typical of a life of pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In one corner was an oblong table, surrounded by an eager, silent group. A bald-headed man with a matted black beard and a great curved nose was taking the place of banker. The great financier Isaac Isidore was as keen over the banknotes here as he was over the millions he gambled in the city.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No servants were present, they had been sent away long ago. Tempting things were set out on a side table, and whoever wanted anything helped himself. The players were so intent upon their game that nothing could be heard beyond their laboured breathing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were gambling in earnest, there were hundreds of pounds in notes and gold on the dull green cloth. A handsome youth, who was ruining himself and his estate as speedily as possible, sat easy and collected next to a young society lady, whose husband would have been shot rather than see her in such company. A pretty marchioness, the daughter of an American millionaire, was plunging greedily and losing as steadily. Countess Lalage smiled with perfect equanimity as she saw her own counters vanishing. She pushed over two small notes with a little sigh. She did not look as if they were the last she had in the world, but they were.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The whole brilliant house of cards must topple down soon unless help came from somewhere. Already capitalists in the city were asking questions about the securities they held, the hearts of certain tradesmen were beginning to grow anxious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lend me ￡500, Lady Longmere,\" the Countess asked gaily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a cent,\" Lady Longmere cried in a high nasal voice. \"I guess my luck\u0027s just in, and I\u0027m going to make the most of it. I\u0027m ￡8,000 to the bad, and once I make that up you don\u0027t catch me at this game again. If Longmere knew that I had broken my word like this he would kill me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027ll lend me a few hundreds?\" Leona Lalage cried with a red spot on her cheeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody replied. They were all under her own roof, they had all enjoyed her hospitality times out of mind, but not one of them was prepared to lend her money. And Leona had had a fearful run of luck lately. Out of all those dainty smiling friends of hers seated round that table there was not one who did not hold her I.O.U. for considerable sums of money. She was beginning to be talked about. That very morning in the Park a well-known society leader had ignored her until recognition was forced upon her by sheer audacity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No one to help me at all?\" she pleaded. Her voice was low, but she shook with passion. The big financier growled out that he would trust her to ￡50. In two minutes this was gone, and the banker made no further sign.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She must go on, it was absolutely necessary. Audacity would carry her far, but even she had need of ready money. And luck must turn now, if she had a hundred or two she was certain of it. It was madness, to sit there, and watch that golden stream change hands and not share it. She could have risen up and smitten her guests, and turned them furiously out of the house, but she had to sit there and smile. The gambler\u0027s fever was upon her, and there was dire necessity for some ready money on the morrow. She rose from the table with a sudden resolution. As she turned, she saw Lawrence looking critically round him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t play,\" she said. \"What interest is there to you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a fine study in human nature,\" Lawrence replied. \"All the evil emotions are here nicely chained up. I like to watch and study for myself. Let me sit down and smoke a cigarette and study.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leona Lalage flew up into her own room. She was going to do a desperate thing. She had always recognised the fact that at some time or other it might be necessary to disappear suddenly and mysteriously from the brilliant field, and that is not possible even to the cleverest without money. Desperately needy as she had been more than once lately, she had never broken into the little reserve that she kept for emergencies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Our hostess has gone to rob a bank,\" the gentlemanly youth suggested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or to pawn her jewels,\" Lady Longmere laughed. \"Isidore, why didn\u0027t you offer to lend her money on her tiara?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because it is probably paste,\" the banker said, coolly. \"Hein, I have seen enough of society women to know something of the value of their gems.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The spiteful little ripple of laughter was hushed as Leona Lalage returned. There was a flush on her face and a glitter in her eyes that Lawrence did not fail to notice. A little sheaf of banknotes fluttered in her hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give me gold for these,\" she cried. \"Gold, red gold, two hundred sovereigns. Now, we will see whether fortune is still going to spite me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For an hour they played on steadily with varying fortune. The clocks were striking two as three of the party dropped out, having lost everything. A great pile of gold stood before Leona Lalage, a large pile of notes opposite Lady Longmere. There were only five in the game now, and the banker was losing in a manner that caused the beads to stand out on his bald head. He shovelled out the last of his notes and his remaining gold and shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have gone to my limit,\" he said. \"Gordon, give me a brandy and soda. Would you like to take my place, Lady Longmere?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The American beauty shook her head and smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not I!\" she said. \"I\u0027ve got all my season\u0027s losings back, and I\u0027ve done with this kind of thing, right here. I\u0027m very fond of Longmere in my funny way, and I\u0027m not going to deceive him any more. But I shall be afraid to go home with all these notes on me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll take them off your hands and give you a cheque,\" said Isidore. \"I shall want a lot of notes in the morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He scribbled out a cheque, and then, with the custom of his class, went through the whole pile of notes down to the last one. There was a puzzled frown on his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are they bad?\" Lady Longmere asked quizzically?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It isn\u0027t that,\" said Isidore. \"I\u0027ve got a fine head for figures, and some of the numbers of these notes strike me as familiar. They are identified in my mind with some sensation or tragedy. It seems to me--ah! got it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it now you have got?\" Leona asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, the corner house,\" Isidore cried. \"Forty of these notes form part of the money taken from the body of that poor murdered fellow in the corner house. Here they are--190793 to 190832. Now which of you was it who came here tonight with these particular notes in your pocket?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The gamblers looked at one another uneasily, but not one word was said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59928.html","bookId":519,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:05:48 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:05:48 AM"}
