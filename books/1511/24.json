It was as if he were in a dream, as the surrounding landscape looked blurry, and he couldn\u0027t move his body as he wished. Though he was able to indirectly experience the feeling of a human\u0027s body, he wasn\u0027t very happy.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yes, he was looking through a certain human\u0027s memories.

That person, whose body was permeated with Lee Shin Woo\u0027s consciousness, spoke those words, and raised his head. For the first time, he saw someone else in the room. He was really old, frail, and even the mana within him wasn\u0027t anything special.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027Teacher?

Lee Shin Woo had just become level 3 and possessed an ample amount of magic, yet this guy had much more mana than himself. He was obviously a higher level than him, and had probably focused on his growth in magic.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whereas the strength of the old man before him wasn\u0027t even at the level of a Skeleton Warrior. If they were to quibble over mana, the old man had about half of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s mana. Normally, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t have the ability to precisely measure someone else\u0027s mana, but it was possible for the person who he was inhabiting.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Gerrit... why have you come?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have something I must tell you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of course, since they had a teacher-student relationship, strength probably wasn\u0027t that important.

But Lee Shin Woo thought he had heard that voice somewhere before, and then, a truly shocking development occurred. The teacher had been delivering his impassioned speech, and suddenly, one of his eyes popped out and rolled onto the floor.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What the...!?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ugh!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That wasn\u0027t all. The teacher suddenly vomited rotten blood and bowed his head. His student, Gerrit, had a hunch that something had gone terribly wrong, but the moment he was about to retreat, his teacher raised his head and suddenly attacked him.

So this was how you handled mana! He could energetically feel it all: how Gerrit had manifested his will in that brief moment, how he drew out the mana within his body, and how he caused change in the mana.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Kyahak, Kyahaaahk...!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Damn it, Teacher...\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His teacher, who had transformed into a zombie, also raised his mana and struggled; but when Gerrit grit his teeth and flicked his finger, the mana net changed into flames and began to magnificently burn his teacher.
