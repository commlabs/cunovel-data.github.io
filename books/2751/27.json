I told you that on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mother, I want the whole story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyn looked down at her hands as if trying to find the balance between honesty and gossip. \"She\u0027s an old woman, Julia. We\u0027re not even sure how old. She tells everyone she\u0027s eighty-six, but you can only stay eight-six for so long. I know \u0026nbsp;a fact she\u0027s over ninety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia stole a glance back at Ro-Ro through the slim window in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Legs don\u0027t mend too well when you\u0027re over ninety,\" Madelyn went on. \"Plus, she was in the bathroom when the maid found her.\" Madelyn grew nervous. She looked around to make sure no one could hear. \"She was naked,\" Madelyn whispered, emphasizing the scandalous word at the sentence\u0027s end. \"I\u0027m surprised she hasn\u0027t had those poor paramedics\u0027 eyes gouged out yet. That\u0027s where your father is right now, meeting with the hospital heads, trying to save those poor boys\u0027 jobs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia couldn\u0027t help herself. She laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia!\" her mother cried in disgrace. \"Of course they covered her up before they brought her outside. But with her leg being in such bad shape, they weren\u0027t able to, you know, put on any underwear,\" she whispered. \"Ro-Ro\u0027s going commando?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyn waved at her eldest daughter, dismissing her completely as she returned to Rosemary\u0027s room, closing the door on Julia and her laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you heard about the commando thing?\" a voice came from behind, and Julia turned to see her sister. Julia used the back of her hands to wipe her eyes as she remembered that she was in a hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a terrible person,\" Julia admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I laughed, too,\" Caroline soothed. \"It just didn\u0027t hit me until I was on the elevator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing with that?\" Julia asked, pointing to the laptop computer that Caroline was carrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline sighed. \"Now that Ro-Ro has come face-to-face with her own mortality, it\u0027s more urgent than ever that we—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finish the memoirs?\" Julia guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline nodded. \"Chapter fifteen, the Cairo years. At least it can\u0027t go on much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know about that. There\u0027s a lot to cover yet. Mom swears she\u0027s over ninety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought she was eighty-six,\" Caroline protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and she has been for a while now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance came out of Ro-Ro\u0027s room and quickly shut the door behind him. He joined Julia and Caroline, and Julia thought she had seen mangled lion tamers on the Discovery Channel who looked better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care how many drugs she\u0027s on,\" he said. \"Someone needs to up the dosage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it makes you feel any better, she\u0027s not wearing panties,\" Caroline told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of revulsion crossed his face. \"I can honestly say that doesn\u0027t help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caroline? Caroline?\" Madelyn came running out of the room, then stopped short. \"There you are! She\u0027s just remembered a joke she heard a sheikh tell at an embassy party. Bring the computer quick before she forgets the punchline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roll of her eyes, Caroline followed Madelyn and disappeared into Ro-Ro\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing to visit an old friend in the hospital was a major social undertaking. After all, the Georgias were all wearing hats and carrying coordinating purses when they got off the elevator. Georgia A. was wearing a royal blue suit with a high-collared white blouse—not black, the color of mourning, but a somber, respectful choice just the same. Miss Georgia had gambled with her ensemble, daring to wear pants. Georgia B. was gun-metal gray from head to toe and looked like a cement truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Lance and Julia, they bolted forward. \"Darling, how is she?\" Georgia B. wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Julia could answer, Georgia A. cut in, \"I was there when the ambulance came. And when I saw them wheel her out, oh, it just broke my heart. Broke my heart in two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it was very upsetting,\" Julia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, in-deed,\" Georgia A. said, drawing the word out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to fire that maid, you know,\" Miss Georgia chimed. \"I know I would. She didn\u0027t even dry Rosemary\u0027s hair before they loaded her in the ambulance—very uncouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone should tell her about the panties, Lance thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, everyone\u0027s talking about it,\" Georgia A. said. \"The news should really run something—after all Rosemary\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should call Channel Eight?\" Miss Georgia offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, the club should be notified,\" Georgia A. said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s make a list, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies,\" Julia cut them off. \"She\u0027s fine. You can go see her if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, dear,\" Georgia B. said, laying a soft hand on Julia\u0027s arm. \"It\u0027s nice she has family.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia A. and Miss Georgia nodded their agreement, then they moved slowly down the hall and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance settled himself in one of the chairs with a copy of Sports Illustrated that was six months out-of-date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you good here?\" Julia asked him. \"Because I should probably ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her, waiting for her to finish, and when she didn\u0027t, he just shooed her away with the magazine. \"Go. Have fun,\" he mocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia rolled her eyes at him and headed toward Ro-Ro\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doctor was in there now. Julia pushed the door against his long, white coat, prompting him to step forward and allow her to slide inside. Between Ro-Ro, the three Georgias, Caroline and her computer, Madelyn, and the doctor, the room was more than a little crowded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia, dear,\" Madelyn rushed to make introductions. \"This is Dr. Tompkins. He\u0027s the Chief of Staff. He\u0027s just been in to check Rosemary\u0027s vital signs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief of Staff, Julia thought. So there\u0027s at least one benefit to having your name on the side of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very nice to meet you,\" Julia said, offering the doctor her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I was telling your mother, young lady—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hump!\" Ro-Ro decreed from the bed. \"Walter, she is no spring chicken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn embarrassed look flashed across Dr. Tompkins\u0027s face. Julia hurried to wave his worries away and then prompted, \"You were saying, Doctor ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It seems your aunt is a very lucky lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother grunt from Ro-Ro. \"Luck, you say, Walter? Luck, has ...\" Ro-Ro\u0027s voice trailed off, then she snapped, \"Evelyn, what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery eye turned to Miss Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leaning over Ro-Ro, a curling iron in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well.\" Miss Georgia sounded guilty, as if she\u0027d just been caught pinching a little of Ro-Ro\u0027s morphine for herself. \"Rosemary, if I could just give you a little shape on the top, I know you\u0027d feel much better.\" She looked to Georgia A. and Georgia B. for support, and they nodded in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, Dr. Tompkins added, \"The office of community relations did ask if you might consent to a photo, Mrs. Willis.\" Photo! Ro-Ro came to full attention. \"After all, it isn\u0027t every day we get to treat our favorite patron,\" he finished with a fund-raiser\u0027s grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRo-Ro surveyed the room. Julia thought she could see joy behind the old woman\u0027s scowl as she did the mental calculations, knowing she might get drugs, flowers, and press coverage all in the same day. \"I suppose,\" Ro-Ro said slowly, \"that if it will benefit the hospital, I might allow a few tasteful photos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Julia heard a familiar \"thunk\" as Miss Georgia\u0027s bag overturned, and Ro-Ro was lost in a whirlwind of Aqua Net and false eyelashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery few minutes, Ro-Ro would mutter, \"Evelyn, this is preposterous.\" But she still managed to pout, suck in her cheeks, and rub her lips together whenever Miss Georgia told her to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting for the elevator in the glass atrium that led to the rooftop garden, Lance readjusted his grip on the handles of Ro-Ro\u0027s wheelchair. Since she\u0027d already succeeded in making two nurses and a photographer cry, none of the orderlies would push her. She hummed and grinned to herself in the sunshine. By Ro-Ro\u0027s standards, it was shaping up to be a pretty good day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia, Madelyn, and the rest of Ro-Ro\u0027s posse were still examining the flowers on the roof—an amazing sight, Lance had to admit, and one he hated to leave in order to return the old woman to her room. But she\u0027d insisted, and when Ro-Ro insists . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young man, when you go back to New York—which you will—you must visit Marjorie VanGundy. She was an acting coach, one of the greats. Mention my name and she\u0027ll see to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors slid open, and Lance eased her into the elevator, but all he could think was, What does she mean by \"which you will\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the button, and they began their descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come stand where I can see you,\" she demanded. He complied. \"You\u0027re too tall. Lean down.\" He squatted. \"There. That\u0027s better,\" she said, but Lance didn\u0027t agree, since he was starting to lose feeling in his calves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know why I married my four husbands?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA proper guess would have been, \"Because you loved them,\" but Lance felt that was too easy, so instead he shook his head and said, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was young, you had to be married to have freedom. It may sound silly to you, but it\u0027s true. My husbands and I traveled the world; we met interesting people, we had fascinating lives. A single woman could not have done that in my time. But\"—Ro-Ro cocked her head—\"times have changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn independent woman today, a woman like my niece, for example, would have other options. Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he said, meaning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know my niece well,\" Ro-Ro said. \"We\u0027re very much alike. She has a good life, an independent life. I don\u0027t imagine that she has any reason to change it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a ding, and Lance felt the doors slide open. He stood and began to push the chair into the corridor. \"Yes,\" Ro-Ro carried on, but her tone was decidedly different. \"Marjorie VanGundy might do wonderful things for you. But only if you mention my name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia found her mother flipping through a magazine in the waiting area down the hall from Ro-Ro\u0027s door. She sat down beside her, handed her a cup of coffee, and asked, \"Is Daddy back yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyn closed the magazine. \"He left. Didn\u0027t Lance tell you?\" \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honey, they left.\" \"They?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father and Lance. Didn\u0027t Lance tell you he was leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia saw the packed bag sitting by the fireplace. And there was Lance, sitting beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cab\u0027s gonna be here soon,\" he said, standing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia allowed the door to slam closed behind her. She dropped her keys on a table and acted cool as she slid out of her coat and asked, \"A cab? All the way out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really a shuttle, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. And your flight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a six o\u0027clock to Dallas. I can connect and be in New York by midnight.\" Lance took a step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you going to say good-bye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to call you from the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad I made it back in time then,\" she said with a touch of sarcasm. She held out a hand. \"It was nice knowing you.
