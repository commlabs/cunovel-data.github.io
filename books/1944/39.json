Please don\u0027t contact me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled—a smile obviously calculated to melt her stony heart. \"I refuse to believe you\u0027re serious. Okay, you have a right to be angry, but I can\u0027t divorce Georgia. It would devastate her. But if that\u0027s the only way I can have you, then—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace raised her hand to stop him. She\u0027d heard enough, more than enough. \"Go. Just go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned again, like a petulant child, but finally left. All of a sudden Grace started to shake. Her knees felt like they were about to give way and she sank into the folding chair in the animal shelter booth. Gently stroking the kitten on her lap, she closed her eyes and took in several calming breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes to find Cliff standing there. \"Are you all right?\" he asked. \"You look pale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" she lied. She\u0027d hoped he\u0027d come here today, wished for just this moment, but not immediately after a confrontation with Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not fine,\" he said bluntly. \"That was Will Jefferson, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Cliff had seen her talking to Will. Her first thought was to defend herself, to explain that she wanted nothing more to do with Olivia\u0027s brother. Instead, huge tears filled her eyes and trailed down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cared about him, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she cried, and knew that was a lie. \"Yes... fool that I was. I did care at one time, but not anymore. Oh, Cliff, don\u0027t you know? It\u0027s you I love. I can\u0027t give up on the two of us. I tried to and I\u0027d almost succeeded but then Lisa—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You spoke to Lisa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace winced; she was only making matters worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Lisa talked?\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded, swallowing hard. \"She came to see me at the library, and I\u0027m so grateful she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stared down at the sleeping kitten in her lap. \"She said you loved me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped into a crouch so they were at eye-level and tucked his finger beneath her chin. \"That was when you started this e-mail campaign, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again. She wondered if her barrage of messages had succeeded. This was the first time they\u0027d actually talked face-to-face, and she wanted to throw her arms around his neck. Well, except for the kitten, of course...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff held her gaze for the longest moment before looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it work?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she didn\u0027t think he was going to answer, but then he gave her a lightning-quick smile. \"You\u0027re a difficult woman to ignore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am?\" Her heart was jumping inside her chest. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before I knew it, I was hurrying to the mailbox every day and logging on to my computer, hoping there\u0027d be a note from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Internet was part of what had gotten her into this mess. It was only fitting that it should be a means of getting back what she\u0027d lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you willing to give me another chance?\" she asked, holding her breath for fear of what he might say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can begin slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lower lip. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff wiped the tears from her cheeks. \"How about if we have a cup of coffee and talk once you\u0027re finished here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded, so happy she was afraid she\u0027d start crying again. Maybe they could attend Charlotte\u0027s wedding together. She hardly dared hope....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia knocked lightly on her employer\u0027s open door. Mr. Cox glanced up from his paperwork, smiling when he saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to remind you that I have a doctor\u0027s appointment this afternoon,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZachary Cox\u0027s gaze went to his appointment calendar. \"Ah, yes, I see that now. As it happens, Rosie and I are taking the afternoon off ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer employer had escaped with his wife for several afternoons this summer. Cecilia suspected they were rediscovering the excitement of being in love, the passion of their early years. \"Will Allison be coming in today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cox nodded absently. \"Rosie\u0027s teaching her how to knit. Her first project is a blanket for your baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia had proudly shared the news of her pregnancy with Allison a week earlier. \"That\u0027s so sweet of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cox smiled again. \"You\u0027ve been very good for my daughter, and this is something she wanted to do for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Cecilia had really done was listen to the girl. She\u0027d been going through a difficult time after her parents\u0027 divorce, but she seemed to have made a complete turnaround.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave whenever you need to, Cecilia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ultrasound is scheduled for two-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your husband going with you?\" Zach asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia nodded. \"He wouldn\u0027t miss it for the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll see you in the morning then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia returned to her desk, her spirits high. Every day was special. The dreaded morning sickness had slowly disappeared, just as it did the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he\u0027d accepted her pregnancy, Ian was a hundred percent supportive, his attitude one of eager anticipation. She felt more confident than ever in her husband\u0027s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt two-thirty, Ian was waiting for her at the navy hospital, pacing the hallway outside the technician\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan hurried over to her. \"How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Just as important, how are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin was so sexy, it was all she could do not to kiss him right then and there. \"Excited. We\u0027re going to see a picture of our baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m excited, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to open the office door, but Cecilia stopped him. \"We should decide now if we want to know the sex of the baby or if we want to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to know?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter to me either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe agreed. \"Me neither.\" He held open the door for her and they walked into the reception area. Several other expectant mothers, at varying stages of pregnancy, were already waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia went up to the counter and handed over the necessary paperwork, along with her navy identification. When she\u0027d finished, they sat down next to each other. Ian held her hand and gently rubbed it with his thumb in a soothing, comforting motion. He was nervous, she realized, but then so was she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to take forever before her name was called. With a full bladder, she\u0027d found it hard to sit still for that long. But finally it was their turn. Ian entered the inner office with her, after which they were led into the ultrasound room. Once Cecilia was lying on the table, her belly covered with cool gel, she noticed how pale Ian had become. He\u0027d asked to come with her, but now she wondered if this was such a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian?\" Cecilia held out her arm to her husband. His grip was tight as he linked their hands. \"Everything\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Of course it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician, a woman who wore a name tag that identified her as Jody, directed their attention to the monitor. \"We should be able to see the baby in just a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the tiny fetus came into view, Ian rose to his feet to get a better look. \"That\u0027s our baby?\" His voice was filled with surprise and awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your baby,\" Jody said softly, moving the paddle over Cecilia\u0027s stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything all right?\" Ian asked. \"I mean the baby seems awfully small.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll grow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She?\" Cecilia repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always refer to a fetus as female. Were you hoping for a son?\" The question was directed at Ian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either,\" he answered, staring at the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this your first child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan pulled his gaze away from the screen long enough to look at Cecilia. His eyes darkened with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our first baby died shortly after she was born,\" Cecilia explained. \"That\u0027s the reason Dr. Chalmers ordered the ultra-sound. He wants to be sure there aren\u0027t any problems with this pregnancy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody patted Cecilia\u0027s hand. \"So far everything looks perfectly normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had with Allison too, Cecilia recalled, but she\u0027d only had the one ultrasound in the early stages of her pregnancy and there hadn\u0027t seemed to be any need for another. Who could have known? Who could have guessed that her baby would be born with a defective heart?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry about your first baby.\" Jody\u0027s voice was sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia glanced at Ian and saw that just talking about Allison had stirred painful memories. \"We\u0027re both a little nervous this time around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All we want is a healthy baby,\" Ian added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do.\" Jody manipulated the paddle a bit more. \"Would you like to know the sex of your child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell this soon?\" Ian squinted at the screen, as if that would help him decipher what she saw that he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A trained eye can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan squeezed Cecilia\u0027s hand. \"Should we?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to be surprised?\" If it was solely up to her, she\u0027d prefer to wait, but there were definitely advantages to learning the baby\u0027s sex in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve decided I do want to know,\" Ian said eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, all right, tell us,\" Cecilia said, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody grinned. \"It looks to me like you\u0027re having another little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan let out a deep, heartfelt sigh. \"A girl,\" he repeated. His hand tightened around Cecilia\u0027s to the point that it was painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said when he realized what he\u0027d done. \"A girl. We\u0027re having a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia nodded. She was so excited that she could hardly hold back her emotions. After Allison\u0027s death, Cecilia had given away all her daughter\u0027s clothes, with two exceptions. She\u0027d saved the outfit she\u0027d planned to bring Allison home in, and a favorite baby blanket she\u0027d purchased shortly before the birth. That was it. The two things she\u0027d saved because it was too emotionally difficult to give everything away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the ultrasound, they went to a movie. Ian held her hand all through the show, as if he needed a constant connection with her. They went out to eat afterward, but because they were saving to buy a house, all their budget would allow was a meal at the PancakePalace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a rare night out and Cecilia chatted lightheart-edly during dinner. Only when Ian reached for the bill did she realize how quiet and somber he\u0027d grown over the course of the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian, you\u0027re not worried about the baby, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis denial came far too quickly. \"No, the technician said everything was fine. Why should I be worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Why should you?\" she pressed, unwilling to drop the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband looked away and when he returned his gaze to her, his eyes were brimming with pain. \"It\u0027s just like before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, the pregnancy\u0027s a surprise, just the way Allison was a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is a happy surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan agreed willingly enough. \"I was ecstatic when you told me you were pregnant with Allison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re happy now, too, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought her hand to his lips and kissed her knuckles. \"It took some adjusting, but I\u0027m pleased about the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is different this time,\" Cecilia insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? Has the morning sickness been different?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-39.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
