Do you want to sing with Mommy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe claps his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of James’s likes and dislikes mirror my own. He hates broccoli. Female sportscasters get on his nerves. And he despises televised figure skating. But he loves Kate’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh—and her boobs. See how he bends down to rub his face against them? Reveling in their symmetrical, cushiony softness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudge his shoulder. “Dude, we’ve been over this—they were loaners. You’re cut off now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate breast-fed for the first year. Weaning was hell. Not that I blame the kid—if Kate told me her perfect tits were off-limits? I’d pitch a f**king fit too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames’s little face scrunches up—like Damien from The Omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs on to Kate’s shoulders with both hands and yells, “Mine. Is my mummy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her a little closer to my side. “Technically, she belongs to both of us, buddy. We can share. But those?” I point to Kate’s br**sts. “Those are mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ups the volume. “No. Is mine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigmund Freud would have a field day in this house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is my mummy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting into a yelling match with a two-year-old is not a good idea. That’s a battle that cannot be won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate pushes my chest. “Stop teasing him. And go shower—we’re gonna be late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her forehead. Then, behind her back, I point to myself and mouth to James, Mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blows a raspberry at me. Smart-ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I back out of the kitchen, Kate starts to sing. In that soft, flawless voice that still makes me weak in the knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stiff in the crotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the song—“Jet Plane” by John Denver—but she changes the lyrics to fit the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e’Cause we’re leavin’ on a jet plane\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll be back on Sunday again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, James, we love you so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate rocks back and forth slowly, and James’s deep brown eyes turn to her alone. He looks up at her with complete adoration. Overwhelming worship. Total devotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the same way I look at her. Every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not a big fan of humility. But watching the two of them like this? It makes me feel humble. Fortunate. Like how Joseph must have felt seeing his wife hold baby Jesus. Just so f**king lucky to get to be a part of something so beautifully sacred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re leavin’ on a jet plane\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll be back on Sunday again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, James, we love you so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drag my eyes away and head for the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get to my sister’s place a little after 7:00 A.M. The apartment is a madhouse—the sounds of yelling kids, talking adults, clattering coffee cups, and barking dogs fill the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell . . . one barking dog. His name is Bear—he’s a Great Dane. I got him for Mackenzie last Christmas because Applejack the pony didn’t exactly work out as I’d planned. Despite some serious begging, pleading, and negotiating, the Bitch wouldn’t break down and agree to let the pony I bought Mackenzie for Christmas live with them. Her main reason was the Central Park West Homeowners Association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not familiar with these types of organizations, I’ll fill you in. They’re the geriatric version of the gestapo—composed mostly of bitter, wrinkly old bags who lie in wait for someone to do something they don’t approve of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch as hang a gaudy wreath on the door or play music too loud . . . or convert a bedroom into a barnyard stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of trying to buck the system and risk eviction procedures, Steven and Alexandra relocated Applejack to my parents’ place upstate—leaving my poor niece without a live-in pet. Which was utterly f**king unacceptable. Hence—Bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s awesome. And big. Sort of like a pony’s dwarf cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’s gentle—great with kids—even though he has no idea how large he actually is. He’s always trying to climb into Alexandra’s purse or sit on Steven’s lap—which can make breathing difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate and I walk into the living room with James on my shoulders, and Bear welcomes us with deep woofs and slobbering licks. We greet the parentals, and Kate heads into the kitchen with my mother—rattling off a list of instructions and unloading James’s paraphernalia for the overnight stay. I put my son on his feet and he waddles over to the corner where his cousin Thomas is quietly constructing a tower of blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Mackenzie is my sister Alexandra’s twin? Tommy-boy is all Steven. He’s a little underweight for his age. But long—lanky. His hair is dark, his eyes are blue and thoughtful. Thomas is easygoing. Laid-back. The perfect yin to my son’s Tasmanian-devil-like yang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a diabolical giggle, James obliterates Thomas’s tower. But he doesn’t complain. He just starts building another one. I wrestle with Bear a bit, until my sister walks in with a cup of hot coffee for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the cup and gesture toward Bear. “How’s the house-training going?” Bear has a weak bladder. And though it doesn’t detract from his appeal, he’s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fantastic—if the goal was to turn my nine-thousand-dollar Persian rug into his pissing ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at the rug in question. “He’s got good taste. That’s a fugly rug, Lexi. I’m thinking about pissing on it myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sip my coffee. “I try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads me toward the adjoining dining room. “I talked to the wedding planner last night and finished the seating chart. Take a look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay—most guys would rather have their teeth pulled than have any involvement in the wedding planning. Sorry to break it to you, ladies, but we don’t give a shit about colors or centerpieces or the embossing style of the goddamn invitations. If we act as if we do, it’s only because we’re smart—and we’re trying to keep you off our backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as the bride looks good and those mini hot dogs are served during the cocktail hour? We’re there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in the beginning, I happily left all the details of the big day to Kate and my sister. But then I started hearing such words as low-key and small, intimate affair and nothing too ostentatious. And I had to step in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause when an Olympian wins the gold medal, do they have a small, intimate affair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey throw a f**king ticker-tape parade. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4/page-11.html","bookId":1810,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM"}
