Not the girls at her finishing school. Not the tsar or anyone in her aristocratic circle. Katerina considers her talent a curse, not a gift. But when she uses her special skill to protect a member of the Imperial Family, she finds herself caught in a web of intrigue. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAn evil presence is growing within Europe\u0027s royal bloodlines—and those aligned with the darkness threaten to topple the tsar.
