{"id":89981,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you killed someone dear to him - by accident or design.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stepped out of the cabin. Nic backed up, putting himself between me and my boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you get here, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very long ago. Imagine my surprise to hear gunshots, find out that once again, strangers are shooting at you with silver. Are there no secrets anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently not. I see you managed to escape from the latest round of people who were trying to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Escape makes it sound as if I were running away. I ran to them and now they are... gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what gone meant, so I let the matter drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s gaze wandered from the top of my wild and tousled head, past the sarong blanket, down to my dirty toes. He said nothing, but I felt his censure just the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward turned to Nic. \"Why are you still here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been working together,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what they call it nowadays?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic\u0027s hands curled into fists. I touched his shoulder and slowly his fingers relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward saw the interaction and scowled. He believed that the fewer attachments J��ger-Suchers had, the less they had to lose. And a person with little to lose was much more dangerous than one who had everything. That he allowed Jessie and Will, Damien and Leigh, to work together, to be together, meant he was softening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the idea that this man was a softer version of the one he\u0027d always been was a frightening thought, indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that I am back\" - Edward gave Nic a hard stare - \"you can go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already played that tune, Mandenauer. I\u0027m not leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because Elise has shown extremely bad judgment in letting her personal feelings interfere with her job does not mean that I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stalked into the cabin. Nic followed, ignoring me when I plucked at his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t we go see Lydia?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic sounded distracted. I had no choice but to trail them both into the living room where Edward turned to me. \"Make him go away or I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" I jiggled my ear. \"Time warp. We\u0027re having the same conversation twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarcasm does not become you, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh, and I thought I was getting the hang of it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not have the same conversation, either.\" He lifted a yellowed brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What more can you tell me?\" Nic asked. \"She\u0027s a werewolf. I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him in shock. \"You don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I\u0027m getting used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has not told you of her other hobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stilled. Nic might not care that I was a werewolf, but I doubted he could as easily forgive my being a murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go,\" I blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic merely rolled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That list of names?\" Edward murmured. \"She killed every one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of drawing his gun and arresting me, Nic merely appeared resigned. \"Is that true?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly. \"You\u0027re not just his right-hand woman, you\u0027re an assassin. And a damned clever one, since you\u0027re freaking hard to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t bother to answer what hadn\u0027t been a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not seem upset, Agent Franklin. You are not horrified to discover you have been sleeping with a killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people on that list were monsters,\" he said. \"The world is a much better place without them in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. I wasn\u0027t sure what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such an attitude for a law enforcement officer.\" Edward tsk-tsked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sue me.\" Nic kept his gaze on my face. \"He sent you after them on the nights of the full moon, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s using you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t. Killing upsets you.\" He narrowed his eyes, tilted his head. \"A lot more than it\u0027s ever upset me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe travesties I\u0027d read about in Edward\u0027s dossiers... Rapists, serial killers, child molesters, scientists experimenting with new ways to birth ancient horrors - both monsters and monster makers. They\u0027d have given me nightmares if I hadn\u0027t ended their existence myself. Hell, they did anyway. Nevertheless -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are we to play God?\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better us than Mengele,\" Edward snapped. \"Or another like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a point,\" Nic agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of being thankful for the support, Edward merely scowled. \"I am going to take care of the latest body in the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed out of the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic crossed the room, pausing right in front of me. I tensed, not exactly sure what he planned to say or do. Though he hadn\u0027t flipped out at the news I was an assassin, as well as a werewolf, that didn\u0027t mean he wouldn\u0027t. Nic was an FBI agent; he should arrest me. Or have someone else do it. Instead, he leaned down and softly pressed his lips to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe embrace was completely different from most of those we\u0027d shared since he\u0027d walked back into my life. On almost every occasion he\u0027d been angry with me, furious at himself for wanting me. So what was the matter with him now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted his head. \"I was scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He straightened. \"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never? You\u0027re not as bright as you look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips tightened. \"Don\u0027t try to push me away, Elise. I know all there is to know about you, and I don\u0027t give a flying fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was mad again. I couldn\u0027t win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly is a flying fuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic made an annoyed sound, pushing past me and into my bedroom. I stood in the living room alone for a minute, then followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA box lay on my bed. A glance at the label revealed the clothes I\u0027d ordered online had arrived. The only way for that to happen so fast was if Edward had made some calls. I didn\u0027t bother to wonder how he\u0027d known about the order. Edward knew everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic plucked at the tape on the box. \"That bullet barely missed your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said, as understanding dawned. \"You didn\u0027t seem scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let you in on one of my secrets.\" His eyes met mine. \"When I seem the least scared? I\u0027m terrified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze returned to the box. \"I know everything now, don\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know I still loved him - always had, probably always would - but I planned to keep that to myself. As previously noted, I was brighter than I looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve heard all the secrets,\" I said. \"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe box popped open and brightly colored clothes tumbled out. I snatched up a fuzzy sweater in neon green and a pair of bright blue sweatpants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I ordered items so vibrant? They were so unlike me - or maybe they were perfect for a new me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the blanket and got dressed without concern for my nakedness. The wild, tangled length of my hair cascaded down my back, brushing the swell of my rear. I hadn\u0027t braided the strands since leaving Montana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t the woman I\u0027d been at the compound, and I was glad. I\u0027d been hiding inside those stone walls, hating what I was, constructing a life that wasn\u0027t really a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Fairhaven I\u0027d been almost happy and that was strange. People were dying; I\u0027d stopped fighting my werewolf nature, pretty much embracing it, inching closer to the beast and further from the woman, and Nic didn\u0027t seem to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t scared I might tear out your throat when you aren\u0027t paying attention?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic picked up a lock of my hair and tugged. \"Should I be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell. There was one more secret I\u0027d neglected to tell, not only to him but to anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard a voice,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just now?\" He glanced around the room with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. On the wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it telling you to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give in to the power. Embrace what you are and discover the secret you seek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t sound like bad advice,\" Nic murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless Satan\u0027s giving it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted a brow. \"You really think Satan\u0027s speaking to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stranger things have happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to take your word on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m stronger since I came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the talisman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Yes.\" I threw up my hands. \"I don\u0027t know. Either way, I don\u0027t need the icon anymore to do amazing things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the secret you seek?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sound convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the talisman increased my power - or at least began this change - and tempted me to become more of a wolf, why would it tell me to seek a cure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who said the voice and the talisman are connected?\" he pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting a headache.\" I pushed my thumb against the throb in my temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in line,\" Nic muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe the talisman didn\u0027t make me stronger. Maybe it\u0027s just that I\u0027m not fighting what I am anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that everyone knows and they haven\u0027t shot me - \" I broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You can tell me, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into Nic\u0027s eyes, and I realized that I could. He\u0027d heard the worst, and he hadn\u0027t run screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t hate what I am so much anymore,\" I murmured. \"There are times I even like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re basically the perfect werewolf,\" he said. \"Power without pain, strength without evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Why hadn\u0027t I seen that and accepted it before? Because of one thing I could never make right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At Stanford, I killed someone who just happened to be in the wrong place under the wolf moon. I can never forgive myself for that. I can never forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t. That you can\u0027t makes you human, not an animal. Do you think the monsters care who they\u0027ve killed? Do you think they spend their lives atoning for their mistakes?\" Nic shrugged. \"Except for Damien, I guess, though when he did those things he was as evil as the rest. You were just out of your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not guilty by reason of insanity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a credible defense, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And used far too often to excuse the inexcusable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to put the past behind you, look forward, finish what we\u0027ve started in Fairhaven, then focus on a cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words left my mouth before I could stop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I want him to say? That we could be together forever as we\u0027d once dreamed of being? We couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t human, and I might never be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-29.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
