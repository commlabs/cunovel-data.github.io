But now his spirit is wounded and he walks alone no matter how many follow behind him. Elder, we are creatures inclined to … excess. In our feelings.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I had no idea,’ Ruthan said in a dry tone. ‘So while you have fled one nightmare, alas, you have found another.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your wake is filled with suffering,’ Nom Kala said. ‘It was an easy path to follow. You cannot cross this desert. No mortal can. A god has died here—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But he is not gone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know that, too. Shattered into a million fragments, but each fragment lives on. D’ivers. And there is no hope of ever sembling back into a single form – it’s too late and has been for a long time.’ He waved at the flies. ‘Mindless, filled with pathetic need, understanding nothing.’ He cocked his head. ‘Not so different from you, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We do not deny how far we have fallen,’ said Kalt Urmanal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan Gudd’s shoulders sagged. He looked down. ‘So have we all, T’lan Imass. The suffering here is contagious, I think. It seeps into us, makes bitter our thoughts. I am sorry for my words—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is no need to apologize, Elder. You spoke the truth. We have come to you, because we are lost. Yet something still holds us here, even as oblivion beckons us with the promise of eternal peace. Perhaps, like you, we need answers. Perhaps, like you, we yearn to hope.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted inside at that, was forced to turn away. Pathetic! Yield them no pity! Struggling against tears, he said, ‘You are not the first. Permit me to summon your kin.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive warriors rose from the dust behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrugal the Woven stepped forward and said, ‘Now we are seven again. Now, at last, the House of Chains is complete.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHear that? All here now, Fallen One. I didn’t think you could get this far. I really didn’t. How long have you been building this tale, this relentless book of yours? Is everyone in place? Are you ready for your final, doomed attempt to win for yourself … whatever it is you wish to win?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the gods assembling against you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the gates your poison has frayed, ready to break asunder and unleash devastation .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the ones who stepped up to clear this path ahead. So many have died. Some died well. Others died badly. You took them all. Accepted their flaws – the weak ones, the fatal ones. Accepted them and blessed them .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you weren’t nice about it either, were you? But then, how could you be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew then, with abject despair, that he would never comprehend the full extent of the Crippled God’s preparations. How long ago had it all begun? On what distant land? By whose unwitting mortal hand? I’ll never know. No one will. Win or fail, no one will. In this, he is as unwitnessed as we are. Adjunct, I am beginning to understand you, but that changes nothing, does it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book shall be a cipher. For all time. A cipher .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, he found that he was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, the army was struggling to its feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Behold, night is born. And we must walk with it.’ You had the right of that, Gallan . He watched the burial crew rolling wrapped corpses into the grave pits. Who were those poor victims? What were their names? Their lives? Does anyone know? Anyone at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s not broached a single cask?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePores shook his head. ‘Not yet. He’s as bad off as the rest of us, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKindly grunted, glanced over at Faradan Sort. ‘Tougher than I’d have expected.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are levels of desperation,’ she said. ‘So he hasn’t reached the next one yet. It’ll come. The question is, what then, Kindly? Expose him? Watch our soldiers tear him limb from limb? Does the Adjunct know about any of this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m going to need more guards,’ said Pores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will speak to Captain Fiddler,’ Kindly said. ‘We’ll put the marines and the heavies on those posts. No one will mess with them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePores scratched something on his wax ledger, read over what he’d written and then nodded. ‘The real mutiny is brewing with the haul teams. That food is killing us. Sure, chewing on dried meat works up some juices, but it’s like swallowing a bhederin cow’s afterbirth after it’s been ten days in the sun.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-209.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
