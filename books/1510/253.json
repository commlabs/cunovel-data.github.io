Before YinYue Palace was only burned tens of meters because Qin Yu had the heavenly flames spread in all direction, increasing the burned area, naturally the burnt depth would be shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the heavenly flames are concentrated at one place, lower the surface area many times, of course the depth would be a lot deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me see if your Ten Development Illusionary Formation is able to become a castle in the sky (ie. Float/levitate) when there’s no more rock below.” Qin Yu willfully fires round purple fireballs at it, in a little while, thousands of purple flame will cover up the area around the Ten Development Illusionary Formation and also the thousands of meters of rock below it and burn it into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the heavenly palace there’s a few hundred loose immortals of average power with a hundred of the lucky Qingxu Temple’s disciples.

Most of the respected pays attention to reputation, if you compare the reputation of an individual with the reputation of a school, of course the School’s reputation is more important. Because of the school’s reputation, many Xiuzhenist are willing to die. That’s how important a school’s reputation is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQingxu Mountain has been burned clean, the gate was totally destroyed, and Qingxu Temple’s Holy Land has fallen into the mountain crevice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly Flame Fiend!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice at the peak of anger came from the air atop Qingxu Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Ming Shan!” Shan Qu and all the loose immortals had a burst of joy, they were able to know it was Reverend Ming Shan just from the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMing Shan led 4 10th tribulation loose immortals and teleported to Qingxu Mountain, however the moment he saw Qingxu Temple, he almost was not able to stop himself from coughing up blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole Qingxu Mountain have been burn down 1 whole layer, at least 20-30 meters, not a single grass left. Left with only purple blaze, how would there still be any Qingxu Temple disciples. Then Ming Shan turn his eyes to the most important thing ….Heavenly Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion, the Heavenly Palace has the protection of the Ten Development Illusionary Formation, so there shouldn’t be any problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut…. the Heavenly Palace is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavenly Palace wasn’t at the highest point of Qingxu Mountain, at this sight he was almost scared to death, and luckily he had absolute confidence in the Ten Development Illusionary Formation. He immediately use his holy sense to search, finally finding it… his Qingxu Temple’s holy land, Heavenly Palace, was constantly sinking. The mountain under Heavenly Palace was completely burnt by heavenly flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Holy Land was inside a crevice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment he found the Heavenly Palace, Reverend Ming Shan already noticed the figure covered with heavenly flames all over flying above Qingxu Mountain, he didn’t think much of it at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavenly Flames Fiend that burned both Immortal and Devil Faction’s number 1 clan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverend Ming Shan who has the word “Kindness” in his name, at this point has nothing but anger in his chest: “Middle Dujie Stage, very powerful disguise.

The first thing he did was send Hou Fei and Hei Yu into his Qingyu Immortal Mansion, the second thing was… fight with Reverend Ming Shan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWukongxue, Qin Yu felt that he would not be able to handle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with Reverend Ming Shan, Qin Yu feels…he has a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Reverend Ming Shan is 11th tribulation and Wukongxue is 12th. The difference is only 1 tribulation, but Wukongxue practices 《Blood Demon Magic (魔道) 》, this make Wukongxue’s strength more than 10 times of Reverend Ming Shan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His 2 helpers already ran, but this heavenly flames fiend isn’t running away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Reverend Ming Shan saw Qin Yu haven’t run away, his face can’t help but reveal a hint of coldness. At the same time, Reverend Ming Shan didn’t want his mentality to be too careless, because this heavenly flames fiend is too mysteriously suspicious. Reverend Ming Shan can only do his best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverend Ming Shan’s protective body aura (护体仙元力) easily blocks the heavenly flames, he sends the sword in his hand toward Qin Yu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Yu smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince of Black Flames Ring (黑焱君之戒)… Gravitational Field\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knows how many have fallen for this skill, even if one can protect themselves from the force of 10 million Jin, their freedom of movement will be sealed. The Reverend Ming Shan who didn’t expect to be attacked by an invisible force, suddenly sinks down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword that was hit by the gravity also sinks. Originally supposed to pierce Qin Yu’s chest, now only flew by his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distance between Qin Yu and Reverend Ming Shan is only 10 meters, to the two of them the distance of 10 meters can’t even be consider distance.

Currently in the face of a 11th tribulation loose immortal. With Qin Yu’s Star stage only being this strong, even when combined with a middle-grade weapon, still has no way to kill 11th tribulation loose immortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Retreat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t kill him this way, time to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of Qin Yu’s figure and he’s gone. (TL. 秦羽身形一闪便要逃走. I translated wrong, but i don’t know what else make sense.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Reverend Ming Shan became scared: “Too unusual, what magic (神通) does this heavenly flames fiend have. How can there suddenly be this heavy of a pressure? If I hadn’t use all my powers on the protective body aura, today could’ve been the day I die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he wasn’t able to kill me this way, that mean his attack power isn’t that high. Best he could do is break through the defense of a 9th or 10th tribulation, it has no use against me.” Reverend Ming Shan felt his confidence took a huge leap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Qin Yu run, Reverend Ming Shan immediately used his holy sense (传音道) to tell the 4 10th tribulation loose immortals: “This heavenly flames fiend attacks unusually, if you’re not careful, you’ll lose your head. I think… when you attack him, don’t engage in close combat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 4 10th tribulation loose immortals just watched Reverend Ming Shan fight with Qin Yu, who would still dare to engage close combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverend Ming Shan ordered. Immediately, led by Reverend Ming Shan, 5 big loose immortal experts hunted Qin Yu together.

An expert that can fight against Reverend Ming Shan and not die, but is not able to teleport?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Yu’s flying is very fast, but in front of 11th or even 10th tribulation loose immortals, Qin Yu’s proud speed cannot match Reverend Ming Shan and the others, after all, the difference in strength is rather large, Reverend Ming Shan and the others quickly close in on Qin Yu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not gonna rush into Qingyu Immortal Mansion for now. They are obviously unleashing attacks to disturb the space, worried that I would teleport away.”An amused smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing my enemy’s own hands to kill my enemy, it’s interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Yu used his holy sense and found a Xiuxianist clan a few thousand li away, for this clan to be so close to the Qingxu Temple, its position within the Xiuxianist clans should probably be high.Qin Yu immediately begins to fly toward that clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Qin Yu flies to there, Reverend Ming Shan and the others’ attacks explode on the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly Flames Fiend, accept your death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverend Ming Shan finally came near Qin Yu, at that moment the Gravitational Field that Reverend Ming Shan experienced before appeared again, even with him being prepared for it, his body still stiffen up. Qin Yu without a slightest effect on his body, easily turned and shaked Reverend Ming Shan off\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your speed is faster than mine, but catching me within the Gravitational Field, Dream On.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, a plan started to form in his mind, Qin Yu can’t help but have a smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanFeng School, is high ranked School within the Xiuxianist Faction and near the Qingxu Temple, of course their relationship is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow swooped down from the sky and flew through YanFeng School like a meteor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reverend Ming Shan, this is YanFeng School’s Gate.” said a 10th tribulation loose immortal beside Reverend Ming Shan via holy sense, they clearly see Qin Yu went into YanFeng School, if they continue to disturb the space, they will obviously cause damages to YanFeng School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColdness flashed in Reverend Ming Shan’s eyes: “heavenly flames fiend can’t get away, don’t mind it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanFeng School might be a high ranked School, but compared to the number 1 school, Qingxu Temple, the difference is too big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly hearing the roar of constant explosions, as long as it’s a place Qin Yu flew over, attacks from the 5 big loose immortals covered it.
