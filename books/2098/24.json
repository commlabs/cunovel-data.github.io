Diana looked a little unsteady accepting the bag of baked goods from Cassie, unsure of what to make of her kind gesture. Since they\u0027d last disagreed and Cassie stormed out of their Circle meeting, they\u0027d avoided each other. So it was only fair for Diana to be a little suspicious of such an abrupt and dramatic change of heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you join me for a moment at the kitchen table before the others arrive?\" Diana asked Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie sat, pulled one of the coffees closer to her, and listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana nibbled on the end of a corn muffin. \"I was up all night researching spells to reverse a mark,\" she said. \"To save Laurel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing has been perfect yet, but it\u0027s promising. I\u0027m hoping to figure out a way of combining an uncrossing spell with a healing spell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Cassie could think about was the diadem, but she forced herself to nod encouragingly at Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me know if there\u0027s anything I can do to help,\" Cassie said. She knew she needed to give Diana more to regain her trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027ve been acting a bit heated lately,\" Cassie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027ve been acting a bit heated lately,\" Cassie continued. \"And I shouldn\u0027t have walked out of the last meeting that way, when it\u0027s so important for us to stick together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s eyebrows lifted, and Cassie could sense her heart filling with hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I want to help keep the Circle together, at its strongest,\" Cassie said. \"I truly believe that together we are strong enough to defeat the hunters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana tilted her chin at Cassie just as Adam appeared at her side door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of Cassie made his tense, watchful face loosen. Then his eyes briefly met Diana\u0027s, and a flicker of understanding passed between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I\u0027m not interrupting,\" Adam said. \"But I have to admit, it\u0027s nice to see you two talking.\" Diana smiled at Adam, fully convinced the air between her and Cassie had been cleared. She gave up on her muffin and reached for Cassie\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027ve come around,\" she said. \"We\u0027re going to go after these hunters here on our own turf.\" Her emerald eyes pooled with tears. \"That\u0027s how I can be sure my sister is safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam joined them at the table, grabbing a coffee, not wanting to be left out of their conversation. \"And remember, Cassie,\" he said, \"Scarlett is a powerful witch, as powerful as you. Maybe even more powerful.\" He stirred his coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to trust that she can take care of herself.\" Soon the rest of the group began trickling in. Deborah arrived with Melanie and a panicked Laurel. Nick, looking icily handsome, stepped in behind her. They were followed by Chris and Doug, and a slinking, half-asleep Sean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Faye arrived with Suzan, who nearly knocked her over in a rush toward the plate of muffins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few minutes, everyone fussed around the kitchen table, drinking and eating. The group\u0027s chatty conversation had a different quality than usual. Cassie felt a chil coming off them, a new kind of fear. And she sensed a darkness within herself, as if with this latest threat, she\u0027d been pushed farther out to the periphery of the group for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easy for Cassie to slip away unnoticed. She swiftly grabbed her purse and made her way to the bathroom without anyone missing a beat. Then she kept walking. She knew the diadem was hidden in Diana\u0027s room. All she had to do was find it. And the door to Diana\u0027s room was open, practically inviting her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused at the threshold. There was no undoing this once she stepped inside. She had to be sure she was willing to suffer the consequences later on. But remembering her nightmares and the sound of Scarlett screaming was all it took to convince her to take that critical step through the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie had grown so accustomed to the elegance of Diana\u0027s room. At one time it struck her as an oddly adult room for a teenager to have, but today it seemed perfect for Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if she were Diana, where would she have hidden the diadem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie let her eyes hover around the room and pass over each piece of antique-looking furniture. She gazed at the window seat and the many hanging prisms in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning sun struck them full on, reflecting tiny rainbows on the opposite side of the room. Bursts of multicolored light swayed back and forth upon the goddess prints above Diana\u0027s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie grinned. The goddess prints. She knew Diana, her sworn sister, so well; she didn\u0027t even need to resort to magic to realize exactly where the diadem was hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were six prints in all. Five of them were similar, black-and-white and slightly old-fashioned. They were the Greek goddesses Aphrodite, the goddess of love; Artemis, the huntress; Hera, the queen of the gods; Athena, the goddess of wisdom; and Persephone, the goddess of all growing things. But the last print was different from the others. It was in color, and was larger and more modern. It was a young woman beneath a starry sky, with a crescent moon shining down on her long, flowing hair. It was the goddess Diana. And she wore the same white garment Diana wore at Circle meetings as well as a garter on her thigh and a silver cuff-bracelet on her upper arm. And, most importantly, on her head was a thin circlet with a crescent moon, horns upward. The diadem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Cassie thought. It was almost too obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie rested her hand against the print and then gently lifted it up off the wall. Just as she suspected, the wall behind the frame had been hollowed out, and there it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResting within that secret cave of torn plaster and Sheetrock was a silver document box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie reached for it hungrily and unsealed its top. And there, quietly seated within the confines of that silver box, was the shimmering diadem in all its glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly Cassie shoved the diadem deep into her bag and replaced the box snugly back into the wall. She rehung the print over the hole and straightened it to just the way she\u0027d found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire terrible act took less than five minutes to complete. The antique furniture still sat in place, and the prisms still shot colorful rainbows around the room. All appeared just as she\u0027d found it. But the diadem in her bag felt charged - it felt alive. She could sense its power quaking at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie returned to the group innocently, shoving her bag onto the seat of one of the kitchen chairs and then pushing it beneath the table. The group had relocated to the living room, where they were sprawled across the couch and the floor, surrounding the center table. Everyone was looking at Cassie now, and they were peculiarly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie held her breath. Perhaps she\u0027d taken longer than she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened, did you fall in?\" Doug Henderson called out, and everyone laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" Cassie exhaled with relief. \"I was fixing my makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam scolded Doug with his eyes and then invited Cassie to sit beside him on the couch. The meeting was about to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie smiled harmlessly and went to Adam. She took his warm strong hand in hers and waited for Diana to rise and begin speaking. She felt not a single ounce of guilt for what she\u0027d just done. This was so unlike her, but she knew that if she were in danger, Scarlett would do the same for her. The group would understand once it was all over, once she single-handedly rescued Scarlett and defeated the hunters with the power of the Master Tools at her command. Then they would see that she was right all along, and that even her stealing the Master Tools from her fell ow leaders was a necessary evil. A necessary evil, that was a concept Cassie had never really thought about before, but that had to be what this was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over at her bag in the kitchen and could swear there was an energy surrounding it, a force of white strength and vigor. She hoped no one else noticed. All she needed to do now was get the garter from Faye. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-24.html","bookId":2098,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM"}
