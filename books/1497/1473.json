Chaotic spatial flow surged, hiding a fatal danger…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swoosh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deafening sound of rushing wind was suddenly transmitted amid the silence. A large cluster of light surfaced from the darkness in the distance. After which, it arrived with a swift speed. The wild and violent wind it stirred caused even the chaotic spatial flow to be torn apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big sister, the three great dragon islands have attacked the Eastern Dragon Island. If they gain our help, they should be able to defeat the Eastern Dragon Island…” A black-robed elder beside the leading red-robed woman slowly opened his mouth. His voice was extremely hoarse as a kind of suction force suddenly spread from his mouth. This person was called Kun Huang. Many of his opponents had been devoured by him after being captured. His ferocious reputation was extremely well-known. Many experts would tremble in fear upon hearing his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no need to be in such a hurry. We’ll let them fight with each other a little longer. The more deaths the better.” The eyes of the red-robed woman flickered as she indifferently spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, the three great dragon islands requesting our help is something really unexpected…” The other elder with a somewhat shady face also laughed in a strange manner. He was Ying Huang of the Heaven Demon Three Phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once we have finished off the Eastern Dragon Island and obtained the Dragon Phoenix Bloodline, it will only be a matter of time before the three great dragon islands are eliminated by us…” The red-robed woman faintly laughed. She waved her sleeve and was just about to speed up when a sense of danger suddenly rumbled within her heart. Before she could react, wave after wave of extremely powerful Dou Qi pillars suddenly erupted from the chaotic spatial flow. These pillars were extremely sharp. They shot into the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe’s group in an instant, causing miserable screeches to erupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you cowardly beings? You actually dare to ambush our Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe? You are seeking death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-robed woman suddenly recovered at this moment. She immediately became furious after seeing the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe suffer severe losses in an instant. Her hand suddenly grabbed at the chaotic spatial flow below. The space at that spot became distorted. A ‘bang’ sounded as the extremely chaotic spatial flow exploded because of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, if we are cowards, why would we intercept your Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud laugh suddenly resounded as the chaotic spatial flow suddenly parted. Immediately, a figure rushed out of it. Finally, it appeared in front of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. Both of his hands were waved as a monstrous aura spread. “Heaven Demon Three Phoenix. It has been hundreds of years since we have last met. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” Feng Huang’s eyes contained ill-intent as they stared at Yao Ming, who had appeared in front of her. She frowned and her eyes immediately turned dark and solemn. “Yao Ming… you are still alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is actually that old demon? Didn’t he lose control while training and died?” Kun Huang and Ying Huang were startled upon hearing Feng Huang’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, even you three old demons have yet to die. Why would I die so easily?” Yao Ming laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regardless of the reason for being alive, you are really becoming bolder. Looks like the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe has been too comfortable during these years. Could it be that you really think that you can step over my tribe just because we are ranked at the same level?” Feng Huang stared at Yao Ming with a dark and cold expression. Her tone was extremely sinister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe is really acting in a grand fashion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint laugh was suddenly emitted from behind Yao Ming. The space beside him slightly fluctuated as a figure slowly appeared in front of everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” Feng Huang’s expression was slightly different after seeing the human figure appear beside Yao Ming. She could sense that this human figure was actually an advanced one star Dou Sheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng Qing Er and Jiu Feng behind involuntarily cried out with shocked faces after Feng Huang’s words escaped her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan? You are that main culprit that prevented our Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe from obtaining the Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit, Xiao Yan?” Feng Huang’s expression became completely gloomy after hearing these exclamations. She looked at Xiao Yan, grit her teeth, and asked a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like I am quite well-known within the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe.” Xiao Yan smiled. He randomly glanced at Jiu Feng and Feng Qing Er. Those two trembled slightly as he did so. It had been two years since they had last met. The strength of Feng Qing Er had remained stagnant. It was likely that this was the sequelae from the soar in her strength after changing bones. Jiu Feng, on the other hand, had reached the ninth change peak of the Dou Zun class. There was only a step between him and the Ban Sheng class. Clearly, this future tribal chief of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe possessed a great talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng Huang inhaled a deep breath of air before slowly exhaling. Her eyes were dark and solemn as they stared at Xiao Yan and Yao Ming’s group. From the looks of the situation, it was obvious that they had come with ill-intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yao Ming, are you seeking to start an all out war between the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe and the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe?” Feng Huang cried out in an icy-cold voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no choice. I have also been invited to help, but instead of helping the three great dragon islands, I am helping the Eastern Dragon Island.” Yao Ming spread his hands and laughed. He was not an ordinary person. It was impossible for him to be frightened by Feng Huang. Her ferocious reputation did not pose much of a threat to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You three, we will not attack if you choose to lead your people and turn around now.” Xiao Yan smiled as he gave them a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who do you think you are? You dare to demand that we turn around? Moreover, even if we really return, do you really think that nothing will happen to the Eastern Dragon Island? The three great dragon islands have likely already surrounded the Eastern Dragon Island. By the time you hurry over, you might only end up finding a wasteland!” That shady-faced Feng Huang spoke in a dark and cold voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan suddenly clenched his fist under his sleeve after hearing this claim. It was unexpected that the three large dragon islands were so anxious. They were already attacking…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should get out of this empty realm now. Otherwise, none of you will be able to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan frowned. He ceased saying any unnecessary words to the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. He lifted his head and threatened them in a calm voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng Qing Er’s and Jiu Feng’s twitched upon hearing Xiao Yan’s words. This fellow had become arrogant in the two years that they had not met. It should be known that there was a total of three grand Elders on this trip. All of them possessed a genuine Dou Sheng strength. They were peak existences of this world…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young fellow, your mother was not even born while this elderly-self was dominating the Dou Qi continent!” A ferocious glint flashed across Ying Huang’s eyes after hearing Xiao Yan’s unceremonious words. A monstrous Dou Qi instantly erupted from his body like a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng Huang’s face was ice-cold. A voice that was filled with murderous desire was spat from her mouth. Although she could sense that Yao Ming’s strength had somewhat surpassed her, there were still three elite Dou Shengs on their side. On the other hand, the other party merely had two Dou Shengs. They held the advantage in this lineup. How could they simply withdraw just because someone told them to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, alright, this king shall test whether your Sky Demon Three Phoenix has improved during these many years!” Yao Ming lifted his head and loudly laughed. His body moved as he rushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will fight you myself. Zu Yi, Kun Huang, the both of you should deal with that brat. Ying Huang, lead the others to kill off the remaining people!” Feng Huang coldly laughed. Her body rushed forward and violently collided with Yao Ming without giving in. Immediately, wave after wave of an energy storm that caused one’s heart to tremble began to sweep apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one of you will not be able to block me. Two of you should fight together!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan laughed out loud. His body moved and he appeared in front of Kun Huang. A golden light surged and his body suddenly swelled. A fist that contained an extermination wind was mercilessly thrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Devouring the world!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKun Huang’s expression changed when he sensed Xiao Yan’s powerful attack. He widened his mouth and black vapor surged out. In an instant, it turned into a thousand-foot-large ferocious mouth that attempted to swallow Xiao Yan’s fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your appetite is really big. Be careful of being bloated!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan coldly laughed after seeing this mouth form. His arm violently shook as the huge black vapor mouth was forcefully shattered. The remaining force poured into Kun Huang’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Groan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKun Huang let out a soft groan after being struck by Xiao Yan’s fist. He staggered back over a hundred meters before coming to a halt. His face was a little shocked as he looked at Xiao Yan. They were both advanced one star Dou Shengs, but Xiao Yan’s fighting strength was exceptionally powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Second brother!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYing Huang, who was planning on dealing with the Little Fairy Doctor’s group, was greatly startled after seeing Kun Huang be sent flying back by Xiao Yan’s punch. He hesitated for a moment before moving. Finally, he appeared beside Kun Huang. His eyes were cautious and dark as they looked at Xiao Yan. He spoke in a deep voice, “There is something strange about this fellow. We should join hands and quickly finish him off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKun Huang hesitated a little after hearing this suggestion. In the end, he clenched his teeth and nodded. After the exchange earlier, he understood that his strength could not match Xiao Yan alone. This had caused him to feel a little stifled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng Qing Er and Jiu Feng had somewhat pale expressions as they watched this scene from afar. Their eyes were filled with disbelief as they stared at the golden figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dou Sheng… moreover, he is a Dou Sheng who is stronger than Elder Kun Huang… how is this possible? How was it possible that this fellow has been able to improve so much within two years?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile they were trying their best to surpass Xiao Yan, they had suddenly realised that they were no longer even able to see his back. This was a big blow to the two of them, who were quite proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo earth-shaking phoenix cries suddenly reverberated around the empty realm. Kun Huang’s and Ying Huang’s bodies instantly swelled. They turned into a half-human half-beast form in the blink of an eye. Waves of extremely wild and violent fluctuations shot out of their bodies like mini-storms. They forcefully scattered the chaotic flow within a hundred-thousand-foot-radius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, so what if there are two Dou Shengs? Today, I shall see just what two Dou Shengs can do to me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan lifted his head and loudly laughed toward the sky. His laughter was just like thunder. The golden giant stepped through the empty air with an overbearing demeanor!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1472\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1474\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1473","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM"}
