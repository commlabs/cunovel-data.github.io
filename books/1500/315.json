Su made all of the choices in her place, and Su silently took on the responsibility of all of the consequences. It was just as Madeline said. For the little girl back then, the wilderness would forever be full of sunlight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s forehead was quickly covered in fine beads of sweat. This type of choice was just too difficult. In reality, this couldn’t be blamed on Su. He wasn’t indecisive in nature, but \u0026nbsp;it was instead because any choice that involved nine levels of ability was similarly difficult.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\"How should I make this choice?\" Su looked at the elder and asked with a bitter smile on his face.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn reality, the difference between the three options were extremely clear. The first two would sacrifice future potential to increase one’s current strength, while the other exchanged for great room for growth, at the cost of all of her current abilities. It was likely that Madeline might even be able to develop an eleventh level ability! However, Su clearly understood that during the period of time when Madeline lost all of her abilities, he needed to protect and guide her just like before, all the way until she matured once again. This was a slow and dangerous process. The little girl eight years ago was just extremely pretty, but eight years later, Madeline already became a dark saint, as well as a true dictator of the Trials Division. One didn’t need much intelligence to understand how many enemies she must have made to reach this point. Piccolo and Mitchels were just the beginning, and definitely not the end.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I have no way of replying to your question.

The steel coffin’s lid slowly opened, revealing the overflowing blood inside. The blood surface that was originally as flat and smooth as a mirror, under the blue flames, began to slowly stir about, all the way until it began to boil!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCrisscrossed cracks appeared on the altar platform, the countless complex cracks forming a profound design. A loud and clear singing voice suddenly sounded within the room, the powerful sounds just like the choir of the olden era, resounding and dignified.

It continuously surged outwards, and in the blink of an eye, a terrifying energy storm formed in the room, ruthlessly eroding everything in this living room! A gorgeous relief sculpture carved onto a black rock pillar had its surface completely nibbled away by the storm. Then, countless rocky fragments were stripped away from the pillar and sharp whistling sounds rang through the air. They began to dance about chaotically in the living room!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the dignified, profound, and luxurious living room was already in a mess.

It then soared several hundred meters into the air, barely reaching the clouds of radiation, and only then did it suddenly explode, turning into hundreds of fragments of varying sizes. The noises this produced rang in all directions!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe elder continued to stand in place, with the corners of his swallow-tailed suit not moving in the slightest. Su had long been blown flying by the energy storm, sending his body heavily into a stone wall. Fortunately, his body was tough and strong, and together with the bone blades that then nailed themselves into the stone walls, only then did he not fly into the night sky together with the ceiling dome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was a power that came from Madeline’s body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLuckily, when the dome shattered, the energy storm completely rushed into the night sky, and thus, the living room calmed down again. However, soon after, a great rain showered down on the island, sending raindrops frantically into the living room that had lost its cover. The blue flame continued to burn fiercely, turning all of the raindrops that approached it into nothingness. The elder continued to stand in his original location. The darkness around him seemed to have its own life, blocking all of the raindrops outside.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was the only one that was completely soaked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe white bubble that came from the Spider Empress began to slowly decline, through the crazy thunder, downpour, and blue flames, and ultimately turned into the concentrated blood.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe elder finally released a sigh.
