When I stepped out of the hut next morning there were tracks in the grass of a pair of human feet; someone had been there — had gone first to one of my windows, then to the other. The tracks were lost again down on the road.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She came towards me with hot cheeks, with a face all beaming.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you been waiting?” she said. “I was afraid you would have to wait.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I had not been waiting; she was on the way before me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you slept well?” I asked. I hardly knew what to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I haven’t. I have been awake,” she answered. And she told me she had not slept that night, but had sat in a chair with her eyes closed. And she had been out of the house for a little walk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Someone was outside my hut last night,” I said. “I saw tracks in the grass this morning.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And her face colored; she took my hand there, on the road, and made no answer. I looked at her, and said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Was it you, I wonder?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” she answered, pressing close to me. “It was I. I hope I didn’t wake you — I stepped as quietly as I could. Yes, it was I. I was near you again.
