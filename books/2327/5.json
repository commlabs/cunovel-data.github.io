He gets her in there, he kills her, he makes it look like rape, he plants the physical evidence, the sperm and the pubic hairs. Did they find anything under her nails, anything to suggest she scratched anybody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but he didn\u0027t say anything about her fighting them off. And you had two of them, so one could hold her hands while the other made whoopee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get back to the idea of him doing it all by himself. He kills her and fakes the rape. He sets the stage in the Gottschalk apartment, makes it look like the place was burglarized. Did you get the Gottschalks to come up and see what was missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"He came up, Alfred. He said his wife\u0027s been ill, she\u0027s supposed to avoid unnecessary travel. They keep a couple hundred dollars cash in the refrigerator for emergencies, and that was gone. There was some jewelry missing, heirloom stuff, cuff links and rings he\u0027d inherited but doesn\u0027t wear. Jewelry of hers, but he couldn\u0027t describe it because he didn\u0027t know what she\u0027d taken to Florida and what was in the safe-deposit box. The good stuff was all in the bank or in Florida, so he didn\u0027t expect the loss would amount to much, but he\u0027d have to have Ruth make up a detailed list of what was missing. That\u0027s the wife\u0027s name, Ruth. I knew it would come to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about furs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t own any. She\u0027s an animal-rights activist. Not that she\u0027d need a fur coat in the first place, spending six months and a day in Florida every year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six months and a day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minimum, so they qualify as Florida residents for tax purposes. There\u0027s no state income tax in Florida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was retired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he still has an income. From investments and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, no furs,\" I said. \"Anything bulky? A stereo, a television set?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. There were two TVs, a big rear-projection set in the living room and a smaller model in the back bedroom. They unplugged the bedroom set and moved it into the living room but left it there. The way it reads, they were planning on taking the set and they either forgot it in the excitement or decided not to risk looking suspicious, not with a dead woman in the apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuming they knew she was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They beat her face in and wrapped her panty hose around her neck. They damn well knew she was in worse shape than before she ran into them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they took some cash and some jewelry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what it looks like. That\u0027s all Gottschalk could come up with. Thing is, Matt, they turned the apartment upside down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lab crew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the burglars. They gave it a very thorough toss and made a mess doing it. Every drawer dumped, books off the shelves, that kind of thing. Not like they were searching for a secret stash, no mattresses slashed or cushions cut open, but a very thorough job all the same. I would guess they were looking for cash, and not a couple hundred dollars in the butter-keeper compartment in the refrigerator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Gottschalk say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could he say? \u0027I had a hundred grand in unreported cash and the bastards found it.\u0027 He said there wasn\u0027t anything really valuable in the apartment, except for some artwork, and they never touched that. He had some framed prints, signed and numbered stuff, Matisse and Chagall and I forget what else, and he had a floater policy covering them. I think the value of all the art came to something like eighty grand. The thieves took some of the stuff off the wall, probably looking for a wall safe, but they didn\u0027t steal any of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say he did it himself,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re back to that, huh? Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The place is really ransacked, so it looks like a bona fide burglary, but all he has to stash is a wad of cash and a handful of jewelry. Did you search him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thurman?\" He shook his head. \"Man\u0027s all beat up, hands tied behind his back, his wife\u0027s lying there dead, how are you gonna strip search him, look up his asshole for somebody\u0027s platinum cuff links? Anyway, your scenario, he could have stowed everything in his own apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just going to say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still with your scenario, he gets into the Gottschalk place with a key, two keys, whatever it takes, he does his wife, he fakes the rape scene, he steals the cash and the jewelry and takes them upstairs, rolls them up in a pair of socks and stashes them in his sock drawer. Then he comes back downstairs and uses a pry bar on the door, makes it look like forced entry. Then I suppose he goes back upstairs and stashes the pry bar, because we didn\u0027t find it in the Gottschalk place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you search Thurman\u0027s apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That we did,\" he said. \"With his permission. I told him there was a good possibility the burglars had started in his place and worked their way down, which I knew they hadn\u0027t because there was no sign of forced entry at the Thurman apartment. Of course they could have got in from the fire escape, but the hell with what they could have done, because nobody had been in there. But I searched it just the same, looking for anything that might have been lifted from downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t find anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a thing, but I don\u0027t know what that proves. I didn\u0027t have a chance to fine-comb the place. And he could have added the Gottschalks\u0027 jewelry to his and his wife\u0027s jewelry boxes and I wouldn\u0027t have known the difference, because I didn\u0027t know what I was looking for. And the cash, a couple hundred dollars in cash, he could have stuck that in his fucking wallet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought the burglars took his wallet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. His watch and his wallet. They left it on the first floor on their way out of the building, just dropped it at the foot of the stairs. Stripped the cash but left the credit cards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have run down himself and left it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or stood at the stairs and dropped it over the railing. Saved himself running up and down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the jewelry they supposedly took from his wife-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have put right back in her jewelry box. And his Rolex, well, who knows? Maybe he wasn\u0027t wearing it in the first place. Maybe he rolled it up in a sock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Then what? He beats himself up, ties his hands behind his back, tapes his mouth-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think if I was doing it I might tape my mouth before I tied my hands behind my back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a better planner than I am, Joe. How was he tied? Did you see him when he was still tied up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, dammit,\" he said, \"and that\u0027s the one thing that never stops bothering me. I wanted to chew the hell out of the two uniforms who cut him loose, but what could you expect them to do? Here\u0027s a guy, respectable-looking man, nicely dressed, he\u0027s all tied up and hysterical on the floor and his wife\u0027s lying there dead, and how are you gonna tell him he has to stay that way until a detective gets to the scene? Of course they cut him loose. I\u0027d have done the same thing in their position, and so would you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I fucking well wish they hadn\u0027t. I wish I\u0027d had a look at him first. Still sticking with your scenario, that he pulled it all off on his own, your question is could he have tied himself up. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His legs were tied. It\u0027s not hard to do that yourself. His hands were tied behind his back, and you would think that would be impossible, but it\u0027s not, not necessarily.\" He opened a drawer, rooted around, and came up with a set of cuffs. \"Put your hands out, Matt.\" He fastened the cuffs around my wrists. \"Now,\" he said, \"bend forward and get one leg at a time through there. Sit on the edge of the desk. Go ahead, you can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see this on television all the time, a guy\u0027s cuffed, hands behind his back, and he sort of jumps through the circle of his own arms and he\u0027s still cuffed but his hands are in front of him. Okay, now stand up and work your hands up behind your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think this is going to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it would help if you were a little skinnier. Thurman\u0027s got maybe a thirty-inch waist and no ass at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he got long arms? It\u0027d be easier if my arms were a few inches longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t check his sleeve length. That\u0027d be a good place for you to start your investigation, now that I think of it. Go to all the Chinese laundries in the neighborhood, see if you can find out his shirt size.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the cuffs, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I kind of like the effect, the way you\u0027re sort of grabbing your own ass, can\u0027t stand up straight and can\u0027t sit down. I hate to interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was sure I had a key somewhere. Hey, no problem, we can just ankle on down to the front desk, somebody must have a key. Oh, all right.\" He produced a key, unlocked the handcuffs. I straightened up. My shoulder was sore, and I had pulled a muscle slightly in one thigh. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"They make it look a lot easier on television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is,\" he said, \"without seeing how he was tied, I don\u0027t know what kind of a job they did of immobilizing him, or if it was something he could have done himself. I\u0027m gonna drop your scenario and assume that there were burglars and they tied him up. You know what bothers me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was still tied when the cops got there. He rolled off the bed, he knocked a table over, he made a telephone call-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a pipe tool clamped firmly between his teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. He did all that, and he even worked the tape most of the way off his mouth, which I guess you could do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to get a roll of tape and we\u0027ll see if you can do it? Just a little joke, Matt. You know what your problem is? You got no sense of humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering what my problem was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now you know. Seriously, he does all the other stuff but he doesn\u0027t work his hands loose. Now sometimes you can\u0027t unless you\u0027re Houdini. If you\u0027ve got no mobility and there\u0027s no give in the bonds, there\u0027s not much you can do. But he was able to move around, and how good a job could these guys have done on him, given that they were pretty amateurish when it came to burglary? I wish I\u0027d seen how he was tied, because my hunch is that he probably could have worked his way free, but that he chose not to try. And why would he make that choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he wanted to be tied up when the cops got there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly, because that alibied him for the murder. If he gets loose we can say he could have killed her, he wasn\u0027t really tied up in the first place. But now, the way things stand, what we can say is he stayed tied up because he wanted to be found that way. It doesn\u0027t prove anything because if you look at it that way he\u0027s damned if he does and damned if he doesn\u0027t, but as far as his motivation-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I wish I\u0027d seen him before they cut him loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I. How was he tied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just said-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean what did they use? Cord, clothesline, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right. They used a kind of household twine, pretty strong stuff, like you\u0027d use to wrap a package. Or to tie up your girlfriend, if you happened to be into that kind of thing. Did they bring it with them? I don\u0027t know. The Gottschalks had a drawer in the kitchen with pliers and screwdrivers and the usual odds and ends of household hardware. The old man couldn\u0027t say whether they might have had a ball of twine in there or not. Who remembers that sort of thing, especially when you\u0027re seventy-eight years old and you live half the year in one place and the rest of the time somewhere else? The burglars dumped that drawer, so if there was twine in it they would have seen it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-5.html","bookId":2327,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM"}
