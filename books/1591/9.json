He looked up at Blayde and gave him a teasing smile.“No. Make me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde glared down at him.“Oh,it’s like that, is it? All right, sweetheart. Just remember you asked for this.” He bent over and leaned his shoulder into Ryan’s waist, lifting him over his shoulder as effortlessly as if he weighed a hundred kopins, instead of a hundred and sixty-five. Blayde strode rapidly down the hall with him almost before he could react. Ryan was muscular and strong himself, but since he’d arrived, Blayde had been tossing him around like he was a kid. Though an average to large-sized human, he was like a child to these Lycans. A part of him thrilled to the idea that he was able to be so controlled by this man. Or I should say this wolfman. It made him want to shiver and tease and see how far he could push his sexy lover. He didn’t mind being a bottom, in fact he loved it, with the right guy. He was anxious to see if Blayde was the right one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde carried him directly to the bathroom and sat him down on the toilet seat, standing between his legs and stripping off his shirt. Ryan allowed it, interested to see what Blayde might have in mind. Blayde stood Ryan up and pulled down his pants, then threw his clothes aside and stared down at him. Ryan was used to being naked. Hell, he spent much of his day that way when he was filming, but he didn’t like the way Blayde was looking him over. Blayde reached for the razor on the sink and before Ryan could say a word to object, he’d dry-shaved the little love patch below his lip right the hell off.“Ow!” Ryan cried, putting his hand to his chin.“What the hell did you do that for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gave you a chance to do it earlier, but you were being defiant. No facial hair, baby.It’s ugly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, says you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. I do say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde turned around and began to remove his own clothing.Ryan couldn’t take his eyes away from him. Gods he was beautiful and big. His cock was huge, much bigger than his, and right now, very erect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling just a little, Ryan decided to see what might happen if he tried to get away. He made a break to move from where he stood, but Blayde caught him around the waist and hauled him back.“Oh no, you don’t. You issued a challenge to me, baby, and I never back down from a challenge. I need to get you to agree to be my mate. I said I would never force you to do things you don’t want to do. I didn’t say I wouldn’t seduce you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can try,” Ryan said with a little smile. His smile faltered a little when, without warning, he found himself flipped around and sitting on Blayde’s lap, facing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHecould feel Blayde’s breath on the back of his neck. “You did indicate to me earlier that you wouldn’t mind fooling around a little. Does that still stand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde’s thighs were hot as fuck, and Ryan could feel his big cock nudging against the backs of his legs. Ryan glanced over his shoulder to stare steadily into his wine-colored eyes. “Sure, I’d like to fool around some. You’re very sexy. But you won’t make mesay what I don’t want to…” he teased, making his words an even bigger challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s good,” Blayde said, smiling at him.Ryan didn’t much like the looks of that smile. “So when you agree to be my mate, you can’t say I coerced you, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a game they were playing, and he was aware they both knew it. He had a sudden tingly feeling in the pit of his stomach that Blayde would play this game very well. The butterflies in his stomach told him he was about to get schooled, and that he would enjoy every minute of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde stood up, moving him back to his feet. Without another word he went over to the large shower enclosure. Ryan looked down at himself and groaned. His cock was riding high on his stomach, still feeling enthusiastic over being stripped naked by the sexy Lycan. Ryan covered it with his hands. Stupid cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * * * After adjusting the water, and pulling off his clothes, Blayde stepped inside and held out a hand to Ryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan hesitated for a moment and then looked Blayde in the eye.“I want you to fuck me, but I’m not agreeing to being your mate.Let’s get that clear between us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde looked him up and down and raised one eyebrow.“You want me to fuck you, baby? I’ll be glad to oblige…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan stepped slowly into his arms and didn’t protest as Blayde pressed his body close. Ryan relished the feel ofBlayde’s skin next to his, his cock rubbing against his own. Gods, it felt so good.Blayde’s hands reached for his ass, tight, hard as a rock.“So beautiful,” Blayde murmured against his neck. Ryan put his head back and closed his eyes, letting the words and the water wash over him. Blayde’s mouth traveled downward to the curve of his shoulder and he bit him, hard enough to leave a bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow!” Ryan pulled back, but Blayde slammed him back up against his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde dropped to his knees in front of him and took his cock inside his hot, velvety mouth. Forgetting everything else, Ryan groaned and held onto Blayde’s shoulders as his legs suddenly felt too weak to hold himself up. Ryan had been the recipient of many blow jobs in his life, but never one as mind-blowing as this one. Just as he was getting into it and feeling like he was about to erupt, Blayde stood up and flipped Ryan around to face the shower wall. Putting a foot between Ryan’s legs, Blayde pushed his feet outward and bent him over. Blayde’s hands were on his ass, prying him apart to expose his hole. He jumped when he felt Blayde’s cock nudge up against it as he kissed the back of his neck. His cock just rubbed slowly up and down his crease, as if they had all the time in the world. Ryan thought nothing had ever felt so damned good. He wondered if Blayde felt the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is mine, Ryan. This tight little hole is all mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you say, wolf-man. Notice Ihaven’t said so yet, even though you’ve been talking a hell of a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan jumped in surprise as he felt a soapy finger ease up inside him. Blayde murmured in his ear.“Gods, I do love a smartass. My own little brat.Some Lycans don’t like brats, but I do. So much more fun to make you mind.You’re going to get everything that’s coming to you, baby. And you’ll love every minute of it. Say yes, Alpha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan refused, shaking his head and pounding his fist against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say it!” Blayde swiped a finger over his prostate, making him yell and squirm away. He pulled Ryan roughly back.“I said, say it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-yes! Alpha, whatever the fuck that means.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother finger slipped in beside the first one and Ryan jumped again and moaned.“It means you’re mine, sweetheart. I’m the only lover you’ll ever need from now on.” Ryan shivered and Blayde whispered in his ear.“That’s right…feel good, baby?” Blayde began to run his fingers up and down his crease, in and out of his hole until Ryan shifted his feet and trembled with need. “What do you want me to do, baby? What do you need me to do for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I don’t know,” he moaned miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure? Tell me what you like…” He slid his fingers inside to find his prostate and give it a good rubdown. Ryan groaned aloud and leaned back into it, yelling out his pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you like that?” Again the sinful fingers swept over his prostate, and held there, pressing hard, making him spurt out his cum against the shower wall, arching his back helplessly and buckling his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde caught him around the waist but wouldn’t let him sag down. Instead he held him up against his body as he reached for his cock and milked it for every last drop of cum. Milked it so hard Ryan cried out for him to stop as it became almost painful, and Ryan twitched and jerked around like a rag doll in his arms.Finally Blayde stopped and pulled Ryan’s face around so he could kiss him again. He kissed him until Ryan was breathless and whimpering, until his cock began to fill out and his knees went weak all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now whoseboy are you, hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck! Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me…I can keep this up all day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Blayde!Please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I hate this.I hate you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Liar. Tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m yours, damn it,” he said, feeling defeated, but still excited by his control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn right you are.” Blayde laughed and grabbed the soap to lather his hands. He spent a long time lathering up Ryan’s body all over, washing all the little nooks and crannies until Ryan was shivering with need and hard as iron. Finally, he rinsed him off and pulled him from the shower to dry him. He pushed and shoved him back into the bedroom and over to the bed. Pushing him face down, he stopped long enough to grab the lube from the table next to the bed and spread it over his cock. Ryan watched him over his shoulder as he smiled down at him and put some on his fingers.“How much do you want this, sweetheart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan ducked his head, like he was embarrassed to feel so needy.Blayde’s fingers reached inside him, smoothing the lube over his hole and up inside, and he couldn’t hold back his moans. “Tell me, love.Tell me if you want this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know I do!” he yelled. Blayde stared down at him sternly, and he dropped his gaze.“I- I’m sorry, Alpha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax for me, then, sweetheart.” Ryan should be able to feel his cock nudging his hole. “Damn it, let me in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I’m trying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try harder, this is my little ass, my little mate.” He pushed his way inside and buried himself deep.Then he held it there, encased in Ryan’s tight passage.Kissing the back of Ryan’s neck, he slid one hand beneath his stomach and pushed him back against him, holding him tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt so damned good to be inside Ryan, wrapped up in his heat. “That’s it, just relax for me. Damn, you’re so sweet.” He began to thrust, pushing in and sliding back out in a rhythm that he hoped was making Ryan as wild as it made him.“Tell me how much you love it, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit, just shut up and fuck me! Move, damn it!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/most-wanted-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-1/page-9.html","bookId":1591,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:24:07 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:24:07 AM"}
