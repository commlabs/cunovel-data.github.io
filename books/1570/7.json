Except a certain miserable foursome who hung around the schoolyard, looking like the end of the world had arrived. Their names? Steve Leonard, Tommy Jones, Alan Morris, and me, Darren Shan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not fair,\" Alan moaned. \"Who ever heard of a circus only letting you buy two tickets? It\u0027s stupid!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all agreed with him, but there was nothing we could do about it but stand around kicking the ground with our feet, looking bummed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Alan asked the question that was on everybody\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, who gets the tickets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other and shook our heads uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Steve has to get one,\" I said. \"He put in more money than the rest of us, and he went to buy them, so he has to get one, agreed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" Alan said. I think he would have argued about it, except he knew he wouldn\u0027t win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve smiled and took one of the tickets. \"Who goes with me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought in the flyer,\" Alan said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget that!\" I told him. \"Steve should get to choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on your life!\" Tommy laughed. \"You\u0027re his best friend. If we let him pick, he\u0027ll pick you. I say we fight for it. I have boxing gloves at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way!\" Alan squeaked. He\u0027s small and never gets into fights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to fight either,\" I said. I\u0027m no coward but I knew I wouldn\u0027t stand a chance against Tommy. His dad taught him how to box and they have their own punching bag. He would have floored me in the first round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s pick straws for it,\" I said, but Tommy didn\u0027t want to. He has terrible luck and never wins anything like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe argued about it a bit more, until Steve came up with an idea. \"I know what to do,\" he said, opening his school bag. He tore two sheets of paper out of a notebook and, using his ruler, carefully cut them into small pieces, each one roughly the same size as the ticket. Then he got his empty lunch bag and dumped the paper inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s how it works,\" he said, holding up the second ticket. \"I put this in, squeeze the bag shut, and shake it around, okay?\" We nodded. \"You stand side by side and I\u0027ll throw the pieces of paper over your heads. Whoever gets the ticket wins. Me and the winner will give the other two their money back when we can afford it. Is that fair enough, or does somebody have a better idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good to me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Alan grumbled. \"I\u0027m the youngest. I can\u0027t jump as high as...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit yapping,\" Tommy said. \"I\u0027m the smallest, and I don\u0027t mind. Besides, the ticket might come out on the bottom of the pile, float down low, and be in just the right place for the shortest person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Alan said. \"But no shoving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" I said. \"No rough stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed.\" Tommy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve squeezed the bag and gave it a good long shake. \"Get ready,\" he told us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood back from Steve and lined up in a row. Tommy and Alan were side by side, but I kept out of the way so I\u0027d have room to swing both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Steve said. \"I\u0027ll throw everything in the air on the count of three. All set?\" We nodded. \"One,\" Steve said, and I saw Alan wiping sweat from around his eyes. \"Two,\" Steve said, and Tommy\u0027s fingers twitched. \"Three!\" Steve yelled, and he jerked open the bag and tossed the paper high up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breeze came along and blew the pieces of paper straight at us. Tommy and Alan started yelling and grabbing wildly. It was impossible to see the ticket in among the scraps of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to start grabbing, when all of a sudden I got an urge to do something strange. It sounds crazy, but I\u0027ve always believed in following an urge or a hunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what I did was, I shut my eyes, stuck out my hands like a blind man, and waited for something magical to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m sure you know, usually when you try something you\u0027ve seen in a movie, it doesn\u0027t work. Like if you try doing a wheelie with your bike, or making your skateboard jump up in the air. But every once in a while, when you least expect it, something clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second I felt paper blowing by my hands. I was going to grab at it but something told me it wasn\u0027t time. Then, a second later, a voice inside me yelled, \"NOW!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my hands really fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind died down and the pieces of paper drifted to the ground. I opened my eyes and saw Alan and Tommy down on their knees, searching for the ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not here!\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t find it anywhere!\" Alan shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped searching and looked up at me. I hadn\u0027t moved. I was standing stills my hands closed tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in your hands, Darren?\" Steve asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, unable to answer. It was like I was in a dream, where I couldn\u0027t move or speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t have it,\" Tommy said. \"He can\u0027t have. He had his eyes shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so,\" Steve said, \"but there\u0027s something in those fists of his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open them,\" Alan said, giving me a shove. \"Let\u0027s see what you\u0027re hiding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Alan, then Tommy, then Steve. And then, very slowly, I opened my right fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart and stomach dropped. Alan smiled and Tommy started looking down at the ground again, trying to find the missing ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the other hand?\" Steve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed down at my left fist. I\u0027d almost forgotten about that one! Slowly, even slower than the first time, I opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a piece of green paper smack-dab in the middle of my hand, but it was lying facedown, and since there was nothing on its back, I had to turn it over, just to be sure. And there it was, in red and blue letters, the magical name:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCIRQUE DU FREAK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had it. The ticket was mine. I was going to the freak show with Steve. \"YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!\" I screamed, and punched the air with my fist. I\u0027d won! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-7.html","bookId":1570,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:54 PM"}
