The sooner they found and killed the Schön, the sooner they could get to work saving her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sadly, as if she knew something he didn’t. “Let’s do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of foreboding overcame Dallas, dark and shattering as he donned his weapons. This was it, the start of his vision. Doomsday, as he’d dubbed it. He chuckled without humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he stop the next dreaded events from unraveling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery day a little more of the future had played through his mind—it was the only thing he saw anymore—and always with the same outcome. Jaxon begging for his own life, Jaxon bleeding, Jaxon facing the barrel of the woman’s, Le’Ace’s, pyre-gun. Jaxon…dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have killed her when I had the chance. Should have killed her when I read her list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, last night, Dallas had seen this very scene unfold: Mia pacing his bedroom, prompting him to hurry. And now, here she was. Pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry,” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stilled, cringed, gazed down at the guns and knives lying on his bed. Another chuckle. He should have locked Jaxon up. Should have killed Le’Ace as instinct urged. Regrets sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to get him killed,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or do the deed herself.” Mia raked a hand through her hair. “But he won’t listen to reason. You’ve seen the way he is with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t I take her down when I had the chance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you love Jaxon and that would have hurt him.” Sighing, she plopped on the edge of the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Goddamn it, yeah. “Did you see her face when he arrived? She was cold as ice for three days, then he shouts her name and I would have sworn I saw love and tenderness in her eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Merely a trick,” Mia scoffed as she lifted his gun and checked the detonation chamber for him. A beam of light hit the center crystal, shining bright rainbow beams in every direction before she rotated the stone to lock it in place. “That woman isn’t capable of love, I promise you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you kill her, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a softy, that’s why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, and this time there was true amusement in the sound. “Yeah, I’ve always thought that about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew in a breath, slowly released it. “Look, I knew he’d hate me if I did it without first proving how despicable she really is. I tried to do that. I told him stuff I’ve never told anyone else. I told him about the list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s show it to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like that will help. He doesn’t listen anymore, doesn’t care. The only brain he’s using is the one inside Little Jaxon, and it’s not too bright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallas sheathed the serrated blade at his waist and faced his best friend. “Could I be seeing the vision wrong?” Only recently had Mia admitted to him that she herself suffered from visions. So if anyone could help him, it was Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months ago, she had predicted the death of one of her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Dallas had been the one to die. He’d been resuscitated, of course, and then given Kyrin’s blood. All of which had changed his life. And now, here I am, in the same predicament Mia once found herself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew one of his friends was going to die, but didn’t know how to stop it. At least he knew which friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she finally said. “They always come true. That’s never stopped me from trying to stop them, though. Kyrin, too. A few weeks ago, he dreamed I would fall into a freshly dug grave and break my ankle, so he actually paid men to visit every funeral held and stand guard. But he didn’t count on kids going into the cemetery and having a little fun. I chased them, fell. Kyrin was pissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know you broke your ankle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “I heal just as quickly as you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid that mean she’d ingested Kyrin’s blood or that she was becoming more alien every day? He shoved away the question. Didn’t matter, really, because he’d love her no matter what. Right now, Jaxon mattered. Keeping him alive mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do we have the visions if we can’t use them to our advantage?” he asked, sliding the last knife into the side of his boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, grim. “I wish I knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to have them for a reason. I can’t believe otherwise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what are you going to do?” Frowning, Mia handed him the pyre-gun and pushed to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Le’Ace can’t shoot him if she’s dead. So I’m going to do what I should have done in the beginning.” Determination rushed through him, as hot and dark as his earlier foreboding. “I’m going to kill her first. And I won’t let the thought of Jaxon’s hatred stop me this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Jaxon’s SUV wound along New Chicago’s streets, Mishka hooked his cell unit to her favorite toy, an isotonic receptor. The first locked on Nolan’s voice, providing his location, and the second locked on his muscular contractions and the heat each movement generated, the isotonic dye pulsing like a heartbeat. Now, whether he was silent, invisible, and/or still, she’d have his location pinpointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five minutes,” she said, “and we’ll be right on top of him. He’s stopped moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaxon leaned back in his seat and stared up at the car’s roof, pondering. “Wonder what he’s doing, if he’s meeting anyone.” He’d jerked on a T-shirt before they’d left, covering his gorgeous chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our staying away was probably a good thing. He’s nervous by nature, and being cut off from physical contact with us probably forced his hand. Now he’ll reveal his true intentions. Betray us or drop his brothers in our laps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaxon flicked her a grim glance. “Either way, he has to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Surprisingly enough, Mishka thought she’d miss the otherworlder. He reminded her a lot of herself, searching for something, craving something he shouldn’t have, for having it meant destroying it. Nolan with disease, Mishka with what? Not Estap, not anymore. Destroy Jaxon by dying during surgery?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re going to kill Jaxon, Dallas had told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t shake the prediction from her mind. Even before she’d known what Jaxon had done for her, she had been unwilling to hurt him. He was her reason for breathing, her reason for living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d once thought about allowing herself to be killed once this case was finished. Had prepared for it, even, to save Jaxon. Now she didn’t have to. Senator Kevin Estap no longer controlled her. She was her own woman, made her own decisions. Only problem was, little worries were now popping up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Jaxon be happy with her, long-term? What if she couldn’t give him everything that he wanted, needed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want children?” The words blurted from her before she could stop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow furrowed in confusion. “You just threw me. Do I want children to what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind.” She pretended to busy herself with the IR. “That was a dumb question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment passed in heavy silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I’m stupid. Of course he wanted children. All men did. They wanted their family line to continue. And while Mishka could give him devotion, love, protection, and adoration, she could not give him kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she survived the surgery, would he come to resent her? One day leave her? Pick another woman over her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d never had to worry about those things before. Never cared about a man, never wanted to be with one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm fingers suddenly cupped her jaw and angled her head. Jaxon was peering at her intently, his silver eyes liquid with understanding. “No,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t want children.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re lying,” she said, not daring to hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d never lie to you. Wait. I take that back. I’d never lie to you unless it would get you into bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she saw that he was grinning, hope proved stronger than doubt and flourished, despite her fight against it. “But why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I get you into bed? I can’t believe you have to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA laugh bubbled from her. “You know what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darkened with desire. “I love it when you laugh, and you don’t do it enough. But why don’t I want children? Because I want you all to myself, and the little monsters would get in the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am. If, after fifty or sixty years together I can bare to share you, which isn’t likely, so I hope you don’t become too optimistic, but if, at that time, you decide you want them, then we’ll adopt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty or sixty years together. She chewed her bottom lip, falling in love with him all over again. Her pulse hammered wildly, every beat of her heart for him. He’d given her so much already, kept giving her more, and now she wanted to give him something. What, she didn’t know. What did he desire more than anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jaxon, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car eased to a stop in front of a grocery store, drawing her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re here,” he said. He stiffened, morphing from lover to agent in mere seconds. He turned, eyes narrowing on their surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun waned in the sky, evening creeping up. At least fifty people milled throughout the area. “I don’t see your friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surely they’re around somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall them, she almost said, then remembered she was using his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucius suddenly appeared beside the car and rapped his knuckles on Jaxon’s window. Seeing him, Jaxon unlocked the doors and the agent entered. His big body consumed the entire backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Took you long enough,” the guy muttered. He’d bleached his hair and pierced his brow since the last time Mishka had seen him. There was a python tattooed around his neck. He was as comfortable in disguise as she was, she supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are the others?” Jaxon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eden and Devyn are waiting in back, just in case the little shit decides to take off that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can Devyn freeze him?” she asked, recalling the way the otherworlder had frozen her. “Even if he’s invisible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucius shook his head. “He’s afraid to try. Even with the scanner, he can’t see him to lock on him, but if he freezes everyone in the area and Nolan proves immune, Nolan will know we’re here and probably take off again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how are we going to see him? I know we can watch him move on the phone, but we don’t know what he’s doing with his hands, who he’s talking to, what he’s picking up.” Jaxon pushed out a heavy sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a minute and I can tell you what he’s doing.” I hope. She rarely used the ability needed to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men stared at her. “How?” Jaxon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The chip.” I need to see body heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitching to infrared vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly the world around her began to fade. When only darkness remained, red lines began to blink and spread, forming vertical, moving blurs. Some were dark red, some were light. Some winked in and out, some stayed in constant place. Different species emitted different temperatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnore everything human. Except the human next to me, she added, praying it was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcentrating only on aliens and the one human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the blurs disappeared. She glanced in Jaxon’s direction, happy to see red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you link with the IR and focus on any Schön, ignoring all other otherworlders?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttempting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral heartbeats of time ticked by and nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mishka?” Jaxon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m trying to lock on him.” All but one of the blurs suddenly disappeared, and it was a blazing, bright red. Nolan was hot, literally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLink complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got him,” she said, “and he’s alone. You and Nolan are the only things I can see.” Nolan stood at the corner of the building, able to observe the parking lot, as well as everyone who entered and left the grocery store. “He’s not doing anything but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she spoke, Nolan’s line shifted, moved to the right. “Wait. He’s leaving, Jaxon. Do you have your surveillance gear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” He sounded leery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Wear the earpiece. I can guide you to him, tell you if he picks anything up or takes something from someone, and you can follow him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not leaving you in the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he afraid Lucius would try to hurt her? “It’s the only way. I’ll be a hindrance, bumping into buildings and people, drawing all kinds of attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re helpless out there, you’ll be helpless in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, he was, she realized. Sweet man. “As long as I’m helping catch the Schön, your friends aren’t going to attack me. Besides, Lucius can drive the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will be my pleasure,” the man in question said. “I’ll take care of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a muttered curse, a hiss, and a squeak of syn-leather as Jaxon turned to grab the earpiece. His warm lips meshed into hers, gone all too quickly, before he slapped the receiver in her hand. Then he, too, was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you hear me?” his voice boomed through the car, even though he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loud and clear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis red outline appeared in her field of vision. “Nolan has now left the corner and turned right. You’re twenty feet behind him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucius’s hard body brushed her shoulder as he claimed the driver’s seat. “Did you get all that?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/savor-me-slowly-alien-huntress-3/page-36.html","bookId":1768,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:30 AM"}
