It must be a migraine, or something like migraine.

Levy refilled it. \"You should all go. You should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" Norman said. \"We can\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman sat on the bunk opposite Harry and watched as Harry drank. Harry was demonstrating a rather typical manifestation of shock: the agitation, the irritability, the nervous, manic flow of ideas, the unexplained fears for the safety of others - it was all characteristic of shocked victims of severe accidents, such as major auto crashes or airplane crashes. Given an intense event, the brain struggled to assimilate, to make sense, to reassemble the mental world even as the physical world was shattered around it. The brain went into a kind of overdrive, hastily trying to reassemble things, to get things right, to re-establish equilibrium. Yet it was fundamentally a confused period of wheel-spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou just had to wait it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry finished the lemonade, handed the glass back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More?\" Levy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s good. Headache\u0027s better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was dehydration after all, Norman thought. But why would Harry be dehydrated after three hours in the sphere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry ... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me something.

I\u0027d say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Harry said. He jumped up, went to a mirror mounted on the wall. He peered at his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think you look?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know!\" ... He pounded the padded wall next to the mirror. The mirror image vibrated. He turned away, sat down on the bunk again. He sighed. \"Just different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, but Harry said nothing further. He just stared at the carpeted floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember opening the door?\" Harry said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you open the door, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked up at Norman. \"You were all supposed to leave. To go back to the surface. You weren\u0027t supposed to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you open the door, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. \"I opened it.\" He sat up straight, his hands at his sides. He seemed to be remembering, reliving it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what happened inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was beautiful. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was beautiful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The foam,\" Harry said. And then he fell silent again, staring vacantly into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The foam?\" Norman prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sea. The foam.

Maybe we can continue this some other time. Talk to the others, Norman. Get them to leave. It\u0027s ... dangerous to stay here.\" And he lay down in the bunk and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHANGES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s sleeping,\" Norman told them. \"He\u0027s in shock. He\u0027s confused. But he seems basically intact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he tell you,\" Ted said, \"about what happened in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s quite confused,\" Norman said, \"but he\u0027s recovering. When we first found him, he didn\u0027t even remember his name. Now he does. He remembers my name, he remembers where he is. He remembers he went into the sphere. I think he remembers what happened inside the sphere, too. He just isn\u0027t telling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He mentioned the sea, and the foam. But I wasn\u0027t clear what he meant by that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look outside,\" Tina said, pointing to the portholes. Norman had an immediate impression of lights-thousands of lights filling the blackness of the ocean-and his first response was unreasoning terror: the lights in the sphere were coming out to get them. But then he saw each of the lights had a shape, and were moving, wriggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pressed their faces to the portholes, looked. \"Squid,\" Beth said finally. \"Bioluminescent squid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More,\" she said. \"I\u0027d guess at least half a million, all around the habitat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The size of the school is amazing,\" Ted said. \"Impressive, but not really unusual,\" Beth said. \"The fecundity of the sea is very great compared with the land. The sea is where life began, and where intense competition among animals first appeared. One response to competition is to produce enormous numbers of offspring. Many sea animals do that. In fact, we tend to think that animals came out onto the land as a positive step forward in the evolution of life. But the truth is, the first creatures were really driven out of the ocean. They were just trying to get away from the competition. And you can imagine when the first fish-amphibians climbed up the beach and poked their heads up to look out at the land, and saw this vast dry-land environment without any competition at all. It must have looked like the promised - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth broke off, turned to Barnes. \"Quick: where do you keep specimen nets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you going out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to,\" Beth said. \"Those squid have six tentacles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no known species of six-tentacled squid. This is an undescribed species. I must collect samples.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnes told her where the equipment locker was, and she went off. Norman looked at the school of squid with renewed interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animals were each about a foot long, and seemed to be transparent. The large eyes of the squid were clearly visible in the bodies, which glowed a pale blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few minutes Beth appeared outside, standing in the midst of the school, swinging her net, catching specimens. Several squid angrily squirted clouds of ink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute little things,\" Ted said. \"You know, the development of squid ink is a very interesting - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - What do you say to squid for dinner?\" Levy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell no,\" Barnes said. \"If this is an undiscovered species, we\u0027re not going to eat it. The last thing I need is everybody sick from food poisoning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very sensible,\" Ted said. \"I never liked squid, anyway. Interesting mechanism of propulsion, but rubbery texture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, there was a buzz as one of the monitors turned itself on.

The blue glow was concentrated in stripes along the back and sides of the creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Beth said, \"the bioluminescent structures seem to be located dorsally. They\u0027re bacteria, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bioluminescent areas. Squid can\u0027t create light themselves. The creatures that do are bacteria. So the bioluminescent animals in the sea have incorporated these bacteria into their bodies. You\u0027re seeing bacteria glowing through the skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s like an infection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, in a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large eyes of the squid stared. The tentacles moved. \"And you can see all the internal organs,\" Beth said. \"The brain is hidden behind the eye. That sac is the digestive gland, and behind it, the stomach, and below that - see it beating? - the heart. That big thing at the front is the gonad, and coming down from the stomach, a sort of funnel - that\u0027s where it squirts the ink, and propels itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it really a new species?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I don\u0027t know. Internally it is so typical. But fewer tentacles would qualify it as a new species, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to get to call it Squidus bethus? \" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Architeuthis bethis,\" she said. \"Sounds like a dental problem. Architeuthis bethis: means you need root canal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about it, Dr. Halpern?\" Levy said, poking her head in. \"Got some good tomatoes and peppers, be a shame to waste them. Are the squid really poisonous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it,\" Beth said. \"Squid aren\u0027t known to be. Go ahead,\" she said to Levy. \"I think it\u0027ll be okay to eat them.\" When Levy had gone, Norman said, \"I thought you gave up eating these things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just octopi,\" Beth said. \"An octopus is cute and smart. Squid are rather ... unsympathetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unsympathetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they\u0027re cannibalistic, and rather nasty. ... She raised an eyebrow. \"Are you psychoanalyzing me again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Just curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a zoologist, you\u0027re supposed to be objective,\" Beth said, \"but I have feelings about animals, like anybody else. I have a warm feeling about octopi. They\u0027re clever, you know. I once had an octopus in a research tank that learned to kill cockroaches and use them as bait to catch crabs. The curious crab would come along, investigate the dead cockroach, and then the octopus would jump out of its hiding place and catch the crab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, an octopus is so smart that the biggest limitation to its behavior is its lifespan. An octopus lives only three years, and that\u0027s not long enough to develop anything as complicated as a culture or civilization. Maybe if octopi lived as long as we do, they would long ago have taken over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But squid are completely different. I have no feelings about squid. Except I don\u0027t really like \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Well,\" he said, \"at least you finally found some life down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, it\u0027s funny,\" she said. \"Remember how barren it was out there? Nothing on the bottom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Very striking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I went around the side of the habitat, to get these squid. And there\u0027re all sorts of sea fans on the bottom. Beautiful colors, blues and purples and yellows. Some of them quite large.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think they just grew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They must have always been in that spot, but we never went over there. I\u0027ll have to investigate it later. I\u0027d like to know why they are localized in that particular place, next to the habitat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman went to the porthole. He had switched on the exterior habitat lights, shining onto the bottom. He could indeed see many large sea fans, purple and pink and blue, waving gently in the current. They extended out to the edge of the light, to the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way,\" Beth said, \"it\u0027s reassuring. We\u0027re deep for the majority of oceanic life, which is found in the first hundred feet of water. But even so, this habitat is located in the most varied and abundant marine environment in the world.\" Scientists had made species counts and had determined that the South Pacific had more species of coral and sponges than anywhere else on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m glad we\u0027re finally finding things,\" she said. She looked at her benches of chemicals and reagents. \"And I\u0027m glad to finally get to work on something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was eating bacon and eggs in the galley. The others stood around and watched him, relieved that he was all right. And they told him the news; he listened with interest, until they mentioned that there had been a large school of squid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Squid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up sharply and almost dropped his fork. \"Yeah, lots of \u0027em,\" Levy said. \"I\u0027m cooking up a bunch for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they still here?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re gone now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe relaxed, shoulders dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something the matter, Harry?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate squid,\" Harry said. \"I can\u0027t stand them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care for the taste myself,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrible,\" Harry said, nodding. He resumed eating his eggs. The tension passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Tina shouted from D Cylinder: \"I\u0027m getting them again!
