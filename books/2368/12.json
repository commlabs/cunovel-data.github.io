{"id":69136,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eAT the Santa Clara County Jail, Ashley Patterson sat in her cell, too traumatized to try to make sense of how she got there. She was fiercely glad that she was in jail because the bars would keep out whoever was doing this to her. She wrapped the cell around herself like a blanket, trying to ward off the awful, inexplicable things that were happening to her. Her whole life had become a screaming nightmare. Ashley thought of all the mysterious events that had been happening: Someone breaking into her apartment and playing tricks on her... the trip to Chicago... the writing on her mirror... and now the police accusing her of unspeakable things she knew nothing about. There was some terrible conspiracy against her, but she had no idea who could be behind it or why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly that morning one of the guards had come to Ashley\u0027s cell. \"Visitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard had led Ashley to the visitors\u0027 room, where her father was waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, looking at her, his eyes grief stricken. \"Honey...I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley whispered, \"I didn\u0027t do any of the terrible things they said I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you didn\u0027t. Someone\u0027s made an awful mistake, but we\u0027re going to straighten everything out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley looked at her father and wondered how she could have ever thought he was the guilty one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... don\u0027t you worry,\" he was saying. \"Everything\u0027s going to be fine. I am getting a lawyer for you. David Singer. He\u0027s one of the brightest young men I know. He\u0027ll be coming to see you. I want you to tell him everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley looked at her father and said hopelessly, \"Father, I - I don\u0027t know what to tell him. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get to the bottom of this, baby. I\u0027m not going to let anyone hurt you. No one! Ever! You mean too much to me. You\u0027re all I have, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re all I have,\" Ashley whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley\u0027s father stayed for another hour. When he left, Ashley\u0027s world narrowed down to the small cell she was confined in. She lay on her cot, forcing herself not to think about anything. This will be over soon, and I\u0027ll find that this is only a dream.... Only a dream... Only a dream... She slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of a guard awakened her. \"You have a visitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was taken to the visitors\u0027 room, and Shane Miller was there, waiting. He rose as Ashley entered. \"Ashley...\" Her heart began to pound. \"Oh, Shane!\" She had never been so glad to see anyone in her life. Somehow she had known that he would come and free her, that he would arrange for than to let her go. \"Shane, I\u0027m so glad to see you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to see you,\" Shane said awkwardly. He looked around the drab visitors\u0027 room. \"Although I must say, not under these circumstances. When I heard the news, I - I couldn\u0027t believe it. What happened? What made you do it, Ashley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color slowly drained from her face. \"What made me - ? Do you think that I - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" Shane said quickly. \"Don\u0027t say any more. You shouldn\u0027t talk to anyone but your attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley stood there, staring at him. He believed she was guilty. \"Why did you come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I - I hale to do this now, but under - under the circumstances, I - the company - is terminating you. I mean... naturally, we can\u0027t afford to be connected with anything like this. It\u0027s had enough that the newspapers have already mentioned that you work for Global. You understand, don\u0027t you? There\u0027s nothing personal in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving down to San Jose, David Singer decided what he was going to say to Ashley Patterson. He would find oat what he could from her and then turn the information over to Jesse Quiller, one of the best criminal defense lawyers in the country. If anyone could help Ashley, it was Jesse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was ushered into the office of Sheriff Dowling. He handed the sheriff his card. \"I\u0027m an attorney. I\u0027m here to see Ashley Patterson and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s expecting you.\" David looked at him in surprise. \"She is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Sheriff Dowling turned to a deputy and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deputy said to David, \"This way.\" He led David into the visitors\u0027 room, and a few minutes later, Ashley was brought in from her cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley Patterson was a complete surprise to David. He had met her once years ago, when he was in law school, chauffeuring her father. She had struck David as being an attractive, intelligent young girl. Now, he found himself looking at a beautiful young woman with frightened eyes. She took a seat across from him. \"Hello, Ashley. I\u0027m David Singer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father told me you would be coming.\" Her voice was shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just came to ask a few questions.\" She nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before I do, I want you to know that anything you tell me is privileged. It will just be between the two of us. But I need to know the truth.\" He hesitated. He had not intended to go this far, but he wanted to be able to give Jesse Quiller all the information he could, to persuade him to take the case. \"Did you kill those men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Ashley\u0027s voice rang with conviction. \"I\u0027m innocent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket and glanced at it \"Were you acquainted with a Jim Cleary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We - we were going to be married. I would have had no reason to harm Jim. I loved him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid studied Ashley a moment, then looked at the sheet of paper again. \"What about Dennis Tibble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dennis worked at the company I worked for. I saw him the night he was murdered, but I had nothing to do with that. I was in Chicago.\" David was watching Ashley\u0027s face. \"You have to believe me. I - I had no reason to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said, \"All right.\" He glanced at the sheet again. \"What was your relationship with Jean Claude Parent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police asked me about him. I had never even heard of him. How could I have killed him when I didn\u0027t even know him?\" She looked at David pleadingly. \"Don\u0027t you see? They have the wrong person. They\u0027ve arrested the wrong person.\" She began to weep. \"I haven\u0027t killed anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard Melton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know who he is either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid waited while Ashley regained control of herself. \"What about deputy Blake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley shook her head. \"Deputy Blake stayed at my apartment that night to watch over me. Someone had been stalking me and threatening me. I slept in my bedroom, and he slept on the couch in the living room. They - they found his body in the alley.\" Her lips were trembling. \"Why would I kill him? He was helping me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was studying Ashley, puzzled. Something\u0027s very wrong here, David thought, Either she\u0027s telling the truth or she\u0027s one hell of an actress. He stood up. \"I\u0027ll be back. I want to talk to the sheriff.\" Two minutes later, he was in the sheriff\u0027s office. \"Well, did you talk to her?\" Sheriff Dowling asked. \"Yes. I think you\u0027ve gotten yourself in a box. Sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean. Counselor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means you might have been too eager to make an arrest Ashley Patterson doesn\u0027t even know two of the people you\u0027re accusing her of killing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile touched Sheriff Dowling\u0027s lips. \"She fooled you, too, hub? She sure as hell fooled us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you, mister.\" He opened a file folder on his desk and handed David some papers. \"These are copies of coroner\u0027s reports, FBI reports, DNA reports and Interpol reports on the five men who were murdered and castrated. Each victim had had sex with a woman before he was murdered. There were vaginal traces and fingerprints at each of the murder scenes. There were supposed to have been three different women involved. Well, the FBI collated all this evidence, and guess what they came up with? The three women turned out to be Ashley Patterson. Her DNA and fingerprints are positive on every one of the murders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was staring at him in disbelief. \"Are - are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Unless you want to believe that Interpol, the FBI and five different coroner\u0027s offices are out to frame your client. It\u0027s all there, mister. One of the men she killed was my brother-in-law. Ashley Patterson\u0027s going to be tried for first-degree murder, and she\u0027s going to be convicted. Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" David took a deep breath. \"I\u0027d like to see Ashley Patterson again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey brought her back to the visitors\u0027 room. When she walked inside, David asked angrily, \"Why did you lie to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I didn\u0027t lie to you. I\u0027m innocent. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have enough evidence against you to bum you a dozen times over. I told you I wanted the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley looked at him for a full minute, and when she spoke, she said in a quiet voice, \"I told you the truth. I have nothing more to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListening to her, David thought. She really believes what she\u0027s saying. I\u0027m talking to a nut case. What am I going to tell Jesse Quiller? \"Would you talk to a psychiatrist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t - Yes. If you want me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll arrange it.\" On his way back to San Francisco, David thought, I kept my end of the bargain. I talked to her. If she really thinks she\u0027s telling the truth, then she\u0027s crazy. I\u0027ll get her to Jesse, who will plead insanity, and that will be the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart went out to Steven Patterson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt San Francisco Memorial Hospital, Dr. Patterson was receiving the condolences of his fellow doctors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a damn shame, Steven. You sure don\u0027t deserve anything like this....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be a terrible burden for you. If there\u0027s anything I can do...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what gets into kids these days. Ashley always seemed so normal....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd behind each expression of condolence was the thought: Thank God it\u0027s not my kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David returned to the law firm, he hurried in to see Joseph Kincaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid looked up and said, \"Well, it\u0027s after six o\u0027clock, David, but I waited for you. Did you see Dr. Patterson\u0027s daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you find an attorney to defend her?\" David hesitated. \"Not yet, Joseph. I\u0027m arranging for a psychiatrist to see her. I\u0027ll be going back in the morning to talk to her again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Kincaid looked at David, puzzled. \"Oh? Frankly, I\u0027m surprised that you\u0027re getting this involved. Naturally, we can\u0027t have this firm associated with anything as ugly as this trial is going to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not really involved, Joseph. It\u0027s just that I owe a great deal to her father. I made him a promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing in writing, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s only a moral obligation?\" David studied him a moment, started to say something, then stopped. \"Yes. It\u0027s only a moral obligation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when you\u0027re through with Miss Patterson, I come back and we\u0027ll talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a word about the partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David got home that evening, the apartment was in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sandra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer. As David started to turn on the lights in the hallway, Sandra suddenly appeared from the kitchen, carrying a cake with lit candles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surprise! We\u0027re having a celebration - \" She saw the look on David\u0027s face and stopped. \"Is something wrong, darling? Didn\u0027t you get it, David? Did they give it to someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" he said reassuringly. \"Everything\u0027s fine.\" Sandra put down the cake and moved closer to him. \"Something\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that there\u0027s been a... a delay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t your meeting with Joseph Kincaid today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Sit down, honey. We have to talk.\" They sat down on the couch, and David said, \"Something unexpected has come up. Steven Patterson came to see me this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did? What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants me to defend his daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra looked at him in surprise. \"But, David... you\u0027re not - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I tried to tell him that. But I have practiced criminal law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not doing that anymore. Did you tell him you\u0027re about to become a partner in your firm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He was very insistent that I was the only one who could defend his daughter. It doesn\u0027t make any sense, of course I tried to suggest someone like Jesse Quiller, but he wouldn\u0027t even listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027ll have to get someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I promised to talk to his daughter, and I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra sat back on the couch. \"Does Mr. Kincaid know about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I told him. He wasn\u0027t thrilled.\" He mimicked Kincaid\u0027s voice. \" \u0027Naturally, we can\u0027t have this firm associated with anything as ugly as this trial is going to be.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s Dr. Patterson\u0027s daughter like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In medical terms, she\u0027s a fruitcake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a doctor,\" Sandra said. \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means that she really believes she\u0027s innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sheriff in Cupertino showed me the file on her. Her DNA and fingerprints are all over the murder scenes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve called Royce Salem. He\u0027s a psychiatrist that Jesse Quiller\u0027s office uses. I\u0027m going to have him examine. Ashley and turn the report over to her father. Dr. Patterson can bring in another psychiatrist if he likes, or turn the report over to whichever attorney is going to handle the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Sandra studied her husband\u0027s troubled face. \"Did Mr. Kincaid say anything about the partnership, David?\" He shook his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra said brightly, \"He will. Tomorrow\u0027s another day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Royce Salem was a tall, thin man with a Sigmund Freud beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that\u0027s just a coincidence, David told himself. Surely he\u0027s not trying to look like Freud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesse talks about you often,\" Dr. Salem said. \"He\u0027s very fond of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fond of him. Dr. Salem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Patterson case sounds very interesting. Obviously the work of a psychopath. You\u0027re planning an insanity plea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" David told him, \"I\u0027m not handling the case. Before I get an attorney for her. I\u0027d like to get an evaluation of her mental state.\" David briefed Dr. Salem on the facts as he knew them. \"She claims she\u0027s innocent, but the evidence shows she committed the crimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s have a look at the lady\u0027s psyche, shall we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hypnotherapy session was to take place in the Santa Clara County Jail, in an interrogation room. The furniture in the room consisted of a rectangular wooden table and four wooden chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley, looking pale and drawn, was led into the room by a matron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait outside,\" the matron said, and withdrew. David said, \"Ashley, this is Dr. Salem. Ashley Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem said, \"Hello, Ashley.\" She stood there, nervously looking from one to the other, without speaking. David had the feeling that she was ready to flee the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Singer tells me that you have no objection to being hypnotized.\" Silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem went on. \"Would you let me hypnotize you, Ashley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley closed her eyes for a second and nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we get started?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll be running along,\" David said. \"If - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment.\" Dr. Salem walked over to David. \"I want you to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stood there, frustrated. He regretted now that he had gone this far. I\u0027m not going to get in any deeper, David resolved. This will be the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" David said reluctantly. He was eager to have it over with so he could get back to the office. The coming meeting with Kincaid loomed large in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem said to Ashley, \"Why don\u0027t you sit in this chair?\" Ashley sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever been hypnotized before, Ashley?\" She hesitated an instant, then shook her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to it. All you have to do is relax and listen to the sound of my voice. You have nothing to worry about. No one\u0027s going to hurt you. Feel your muscles relax. That\u0027s it. Just relax and feel your eyes getting heavy. You\u0027ve been through a lot. Your body is tired, very tired. All you want to do is to go to sleep. Just close your eyes and relax. You\u0027re getting very sleepy... very sleepy....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took ten minutes to put her under. Dr. Salem walked over to Ashley. \"Ashley, do you know where you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m in jail.\" Her voice sounded hollow, as though coming from a distance. \"Do you know why you\u0027re in jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People think I did something bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And is it true? Did you do something bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley, did you ever kill anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid looked at Dr. Salem in surprise. Weren\u0027t people supposed to tell the truth under hypnosis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea who could have committed those murders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Ashley\u0027s face contorted and she began breathing hard, in short, raspy breaths. The two men watched in astonishment as her persona started changing. Her Ups tightened and her features seemed to shift. She sat up straight, and there was a sudden liveliness in her face. She opened her eyes, and they were sparkling. It was an amazing transformation. Unexpectedly, she began to sing, in a sultry voice with an English accent:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half a pound of tupenny rice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a pound of treacle,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMix it up and make it nice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop! goes the weasel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid listened in astonishment. Who does she think she\u0027s fooling? She\u0027s pretending to be someone else. \"I want to ask you some more questions, Ashley.\" She tossed her head and said in an English accent, \"I\u0027m not Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem exchanged a look with David, then turned back to Ashley. \"If you\u0027re not Ashley, who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni. Toni Prescott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ashley is doing this with a straight face, David thought How long is she going to go on with this stupid charade? She was wasting their time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley,\" said Dr. Salem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s determined to keep it up, David thought \"All right, Toni. What I\u0027d like is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me tell you what I\u0027d like. I\u0027d like to get out of this bloody place. Can you get us out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends,\" Dr. Salem said. \"What do you know about - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - those murders that little Goody Two-shoes is in here for?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I can tell you things that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley\u0027s expression suddenly started to change again. As David and Dr. Salem watched, Ashley seemed to shrink in her chair, and her face began to soften and go through an incredible metamorphosis until she seemed to become another distinct personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said in a soft voice with an Italian accent, \"Toni... don\u0027t say any more, per piacere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was watching in bewilderment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni?\" Dr. Salem edged closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft voice said, \"I apologize for the interruption, Dr. Salem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem asked, \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Alette. Alette Peters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, it\u0027s not an act, David thought. It\u0027s real. He turned to Dr. Salem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem said quietly, \"They\u0027re alters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stared at him, totally confused. \"They\u0027re what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll explain later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem turned back to Ashley. \"Ashley... I mean Alette... How - how many of you are in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beside Ashley, only Toni and me,\" Alette answered. \"You have an Italian accent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I was born in Rome. Have you ever been to Rome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ve never been to Rome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe I\u0027m hearing this conversation, David thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"E molto bello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure. Do you know Toni?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si, naturalmente.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has an English accent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni was born in London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right Alette, I want to ask you about these murders. Do you have any idea who - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd David and Dr. Salem watched as Ashley\u0027s face and personality changed again before their eyes. Without her saying a word, they knew that she had become Toni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wasting your time with her, luv.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that English accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette doesn\u0027t know anything. I\u0027m the one you\u0027re going to have to talk to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Toni. I\u0027ll talk to you. I have some questions for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do, but I\u0027m tired.\" She yawned. \"Miss Tight Ass has kept us up all night I\u0027ve got to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Toni. Listen to me. You have to help us to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face hardened. \"Why should I help you? What has Miss Goody Two-shoes done for Alette or me? All she ever does is keep us from having fun. Well, I\u0027m sick of it, and I\u0027m sick of her. Do you hear me?\" She was screaming, her face contorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem said, \"I\u0027m going to bring her out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was perspiring. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem leaned close to Ashley. \"Ashley... Ashley... Everything is fine. Close your eyes now. They\u0027re very heavy, very heavy. You\u0027re completely relaxed. Ashley, your mind is at peace. Your body is relaxed. You\u0027re going to wake up at the count of five, completely relaxed. One...\" He looked over at David and then back at Ashley. \"Two...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley began to stir. They watched her expression start to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face softened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tour...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could sense her returning, and it was an eerie feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley opened her eyes. She looked around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was I asleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stood there, staring at her, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Dr. Salem said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley turned to David. \"Did I say anything? I mean... was helpful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, David thought. She doesn\u0027t know! She really doesn\u0027t know! David said, \"You did fine, Ashley. I\u0027d like to talk to Dr. Salem alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men stood there, watching the matron lead Ashley away. David sank into a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What - what the hell was that all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem took a deep breath. \"In all the years that I\u0027ve been practicing, I\u0027ve never seen a more clear-cut case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A case of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever heard of multiple personality disorder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a condition where there are several completely different personalities in one body. It\u0027s also known as dissociatve identity disorder. It\u0027s been in the psychiatric literature for more than two hundred years. It usually starts because of a childhood trauma. The victim shuts out the trauma by creating another identity. Sometimes a person will have dozens of different personalities or alters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they know about each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. Toni and Alette know each other. Ashley is obviously not aware of either of them. Alters are created because the host can\u0027t stand the pain of the trauma. It\u0027s a way of escape. Every time a fresh shock occurs, a new alter can be born. The psychiatric literature on the subject shows that alters can be totally different from one another. Some alters are stupid, while others are brilliant. They can speak different languages. They have varied tastes and personalities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How - how common is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some studies suggest that one percent of the entire population suffers from multiple personality disorder, and that up to twenty percent of all patients in psychiatric hospitals have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said, \"But Ashley seems so normal and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People with MPD are normal... until an alter takes over. The host can have a job, raise a family and live a perfectly ordinary life, but an alter can take over at any time. An alter can be in control for an hour, a day or even weeks, and then the host suffers a fugue, a loss of time and memory, for the period that the alter is in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Ashley - the host - would have no recollection of anything that the alter does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\" David listened, spellbound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The most famous case of multiple personality disorder was Bridey Murphy. That\u0027s what first brought the subject to the public\u0027s attention. Since then, there have been an endless number of cases, but none as spectacular or as well publicized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It - it seems so incredible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a subject that\u0027s fascinated me for a long time. There are certain patterns that almost never change. For instance, frequently, alters use the same initials as then-host - Ashley Patterson... Alette Peters... Toni Prescott....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni - ?\" David started to ask. Then he realized, \"Antoinette?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You\u0027ve heard the expression \u0027alter ego.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a sense, we all have alter egos, or multiple personalities. A kind person can commit acts of cruelty. Cruel people can do kind things. There\u0027s no limit to the incredible range of human emotions. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is fiction, but it\u0027s based on fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s mind was racing. \"If Ashley committed the murders...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would not be aware of it. It was done by one of her alters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God! How can I explain that in court?\" Dr. Salem looked at David curiously. \"I thought you said you weren\u0027t going to be her attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shook his head. \"I\u0027m not. I mean, don\u0027t know. I - At this point, I\u0027m a multiple personality myself.\" David was silent for a moment. \"Is this curable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it can\u0027t be cured, what happens?\" There was a pause. \"The suicide rate is quite high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Ashley knows nothing about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would - would you explain it to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" It was a scream. She was cowering against the wall of her cell, her eyes filled with terror. \"You\u0027re lying! It\u0027s not true!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem said, \"Ashley, it is. You have to face it. I\u0027ve explained to you that what happened to you is not your fault. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come near me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to die. Help me die!\" She began sobbing uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Salem looked at the matron and said, \"You\u0027d better give her a sedative. And put a suicide watch on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid telephoned Dr. Patterson. \"I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting to hear from you, David. Did you see Ashley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Can we meet somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait in my office for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving back to San Francisco, David thought. There\u0027s no way that I can take this case. I have too much to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll find her a good criminal attorney and that will be the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson was waiting for David in his office. \"You talked to Ashley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I answer that question? David took a deep breath. \"Have you ever heard of multiple personality disorder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson frowned. \"Vaguely...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s when one or more personalities - or alters - exist in a person and take control from time to time, and that person is not aware of it. Your daughter has multiple personality disorder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson was looking at him, stunned. \"What? I - can\u0027t believe it. Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I listened to Ashley while Dr. Salem had her under hypnosis. She has two alters. At various times, they possess her.\" David was talking more rapidly now. \"The sheriff showed me the evidence against your daughter. There\u0027s no doubt that she committed the murders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson said. \"Oh, my God! Then she\u0027s - she\u0027s guilty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Because I don\u0027t believe she was aware that she committed the murders. She was under the influence of one of the alters. Ashley had no reason to commit those crimes. She had no motive, and she was not in control of herself. I think the state may have a difficult time proving motive or intent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then your defense is going to be that - \" David stopped him. \"I\u0027m not going to defend her. I\u0027m going to get you Jesse Quiller. He\u0027s a brilliant trial lawyer. I used to work with him, and he\u0027s the most - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Dr. Patterson\u0027s voice was sharp. \"You must defend Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said patiently, \"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m not the right one to defend her. She needs - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you before that you\u0027re the only one I trust. My daughter means everything in the world to me, David. You\u0027re going to save her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m not qualified to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you are. You were a criminal attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t have anyone else.\" David could see that Dr. Patterson was trying to keep his temper under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes no sense, David thought. He tried again. \"Jesse Quiller is the best - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson leaned forward, the color rising in his face. \"David, your mother\u0027s life meant a lot to you. Ashley\u0027s life means as much to me. You asked for my help once, and you put your mother\u0027s life in my hands. I\u0027m asking for your help now, and I\u0027m putting Ashley\u0027s life in your hands. I want you to defend Ashley. You owe me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won\u0027t listen, David thought despairingly. What\u0027s the matter with him? A dozen objections flashed through David\u0027s mind, but they all faded before that one line: \"You owe me that.\" David tried one last time. \"Dr. Patterson - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes or no, David.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-12.html","bookId":2368,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM"}
