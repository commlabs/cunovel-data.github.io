It’s not that I don’t want children. I just don’t want one now. Now was not part of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s Drew. he loves me, I know. But pregnancy changes things. It means stretch marks and saggy boobs and sleepless nights. No more spontaneous vacations. No more sex marathons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe’s going to freak out. Definitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down on a bench and watch the cars drive by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a voice to my right grabs my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s a good boy? Andrew is! My sweet boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a woman with soft blond curls and dark eyes, about my age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she’s holding a doe-headed bundle of drool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you believe in signs? I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my grandmother did. She was an incredible woman—a respected archeologist who did extensive study on the southern Native American tribes. I worshipped my grandma. She once told me that signs were all around us. Guides to point us in the right direction, toward our fate. Our destiny. That all we had to do was open our eyes and our hearts, and we would find our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I watch the young mother and her child. And then a man comes up to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“hey. Sorry I’m late. Damn meeting ran over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assume he’s her husband. he kisses her. Then he takes the bundle from her and holds it up over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s my guy. hey, buddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his smile is so warm, so beautiful, it literally takes my breath away. The golden couple lean against each other tenderly, the baby between them, pulling them together like a magnet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like a voyeur, but the moment is so precious I can’t look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when it hits me. I’m not just pregnant. I’m having a baby. Drew and I made a baby. A whole new person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd an image appears in my head. So clear. So perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark-haired little boy, with Drew’s smart-ass smile and my sparkling personality. A part of each of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about the way Steven looked at Alexandra last night when they announced the big news. I picture the way Drew watches me when he thinks I’m not looking. And the way he cuddled with Mackenzie when she fell asleep beside him on the couch. I remember how wonderful it feels to teach her to play the guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how amazing it would be to teach a baby . . . everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew would adore having a small someone to show things to—like how to play chess, and basketball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how to curse in four different languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew isn’t Joey Martino. his family means everything to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean everything to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m having his baby. Oh my God. The pregnancy hormones must be on overload, because tears fill my eyes and stream down my cheeks. happy tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it’s going to be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I will have stretch marks, but this is New York—the plastic surgery capital of the world. And sure, there are things I want to accomplish professionally. And I will. Because Drew will be there to help me. To support me. Like he has since the day I met him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe’s going to be excited—like a kid getting an unexpected gift on Christmas morning. It’ll be a shock at first, but can’t you just see him? Elated. Overjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, miss, are you all right?” I must be crying louder than I thought, because Baby-Daddy is looking at me with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wipe at my cheeks, embarrassed. “Yes, I’m fine. I’m just . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze at their child. “he’s just so beautiful. You’re all so beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI break down in a round of fresh sobs, and the mother takes a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Now I’m the crazy lady on a bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asks, “Is there someone you need us to call?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a breath and pull myself together. And then I smile. “No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m all right. Really. It’s just . . . I’m having a baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I just said it to two perfect strangers, which is a little messed up, but still. Am I scared? Of course I am. But I’ve never run from a challenge in my life—why would I start now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, congratulations, and good luck to you, miss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family turns and walks down the street together. As I watch them go, a store display to the right catches my eye. It’s a Yankee merchandise store, and in the window is a teeny-tiny T-shirt that says, FUTURE YANKEES PITChER. And my excitement blooms like a flower in a rainforest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause now I know just how I’m going to tell Drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you know about ESP? Extrasensory Perception; the knowledge of an incident before it takes place. We all have a little bit of it—that other ninety percent of our brains we don’t use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s those times in the car when you think of a song you haven’t heard in years, and it’s the next one that comes on the radio. It’s those mornings when you picture an old friend and at dinnertime the phone rings, and it’s the friend you were thinking of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was never a big believer in that sort of thing. But as the store clerk handed me my change for the tiny T-shirt, a ball of anxiety settled deep in my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn’t normal butterflies. It was urgent. Desperate unease, like when you realize you forgot to pay a credit card bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to get to Drew. I had to talk to him—to tell him—and it had to be now. I walked quickly down the street. Well . . . as quickly as I could in three-inch heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs every step carried me closer to our building, the worry increased exponentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time I chalked it up to the news I was about to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut looking back now, I think it was something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I stood outside our apartment door, my knees were shaking and my palms were sweaty. Then I reached for the knob. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have a weak stomach? You may not want to watch this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won’t be pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step into the apartment. The lights are out. I put my keys on the table and take off my coat. I flick the switch on the wall, flooding the room with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when I see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew is standing in the middle of our living room, his dress shirt unbuttoned, exposing the chest that I’ve traced my fingers over a thousand times. The warm, bronze skin I love to touch. he has a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniel’s in one hand. And the other hand is hidden. Buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a mane of wavy auburn hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s the opposite of me in every way. Thick red tresses, br**sts the size of watermelons, perky in their fakeness. She’s tall—as tall as Drew—even without the stilettos. her lips are red and lush, plump enough to make Angelina Jolie envious. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-14.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
