It wasn’t fastened, only slipped into place so it was easy to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped the latch and pulled, but the door didn’t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she pushed. It groaned forward, and a gust of air puffed into the underground chamber. Briar didn’t need to smell the gas through the mask or look through her fragment of polarized lens to know it was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, she found a set of stone stairs. The stairs led up and out, but no farther down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t give herself time to change her mind or look for another way through the situation. Up on the street she could get her bearings. She flattened herself sideways and squeezed past a wooden door onto the stairwell. She used her backside to push the door shut and lifted the rifle again, forcing her hands to steady and her attention to focus, because here she was, in Seattle proper. Inside the wall, with the terrible things that were trapped within it, and terrible people, too, for all she knew of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rifle made her feel safer. She squeezed it hard and silently thanked her late father for his taste in firearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp the steps she couldn’t see a thing except for a sharp rectangle of hard ash gray, and it wasn’t even the gray of the sky. It was the permanent dusk imposed by the height of the wall, its shadow blocking out even the weak, drizzling sunlight that came for a few hours each day during the winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What street is this?” Briar asked herself. Her own voice wasn’t much more comfort than the rifle. “What street?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was odd about the door, she thought, but it didn’t occur to her until she was past it that there had been no external latch, knob, or even a lock. It was a door designed to keep people out unless they had the permission of those already secured there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost gave her a flash of panic, knowing that now, even if she needed to, she could not retreat. But retreat wasn’t part of the plan, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan was up. The plan was to reach the street, scout for street markers, acquire her bearings, and then set out for… Where? Well. There was always home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house on the side of the hill hadn’t been home for very long, only a few months; and since she now knew there were people inside the wall, she could safely bet that the house had been raided for the bulk of its valuables. But there might be something useful remaining. Leviticus had made so many machines, and he’d hidden so much of his best and favorite devices in tricky, closed-off rooms that might’ve gone overlooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd besides—she knew nothing of Ezekiel’s plans except that he’d wanted to see his father’s laboratory and hunt for exonerating evidence there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Ezekiel even know where the house was located?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar rather thought that he didn’t; but then again, she’d also thought he couldn’t get inside the city, and she’d been quite wrong on that point. He was a resourceful boy; she had to give him that. Her wisest course of action might be to simply assume that he’d succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she lurked at the bottom of the chipped stone stairs, down in the darkness as if she were sitting in a well, Briar slowly caught her breath and found her psychic footing. No one shoved the door open and discovered her. Not a sound reached her ears—not even the clanging racket of the machine works in the building at her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might not be so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned one booted toe forward and placed it quietly on the nearest stair. The second step was climbed with equal slowness and silence. While her mask-impaired side vision permitted it, Briar watched the door behind her shrink as she rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d heard stories about the rotters, and she’d seen a few of them in the first days after the Blight broke, but how many could possibly be left inside the city? Surely at some point they would die, or fail, or decay, or simply succumb to the elements. They must be in terrible shape, and weak as kittens if they still crawled or shambled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr that is what she told herself as she climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBending her knees to crouch, she kept her head below the crest of the stairwell until the last possible moment, and then she craned her neck to see without exposing herself to whatever might wait above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore dark than bright, the city was not quite so bleak that she’d need a light, but it wouldn’t be long before the tar-thick shadows of the walls and the roofs would cast the whole scene into early midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe street crumbled at Briar’s eye level, slick and muddy from rainwater and Blight runoff. Its bricks split and spread. The whole surface was uneven and lumpy, and it was littered with debris. Carts sprawled overturned and broken; the mostly dismembered and long-decayed corpses of horses and dogs were scattered into piles of sticky bones, loosely connected by stringy, green-gray tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar swiveled her head slowly left, then right. She couldn’t see far in any direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the dimness and the concentrated, thickened air, no more than half a block could be discerned at once. Which way the streets ran, there was no telling. North and south, east and west, none of it meant anything without the sun to guess it by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even the faintest gust of air ruffled Briar’s hair, and she couldn’t hear the water, or the birds. Once upon a time there had been birds by the thousands, most of them crows and seagulls, all of them loud. Together the tribes had made a mighty racket of feathers and clacking calls, and the silence without them was strange. No birds, no people. No machines or horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading with her left hand, Briar crept up and out of her hole on leather-soled feet that didn’t make a sound to disturb the disturbing silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she stood out in the open, close against the building beside the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only sound was the rustle of her own hair against the straps and sides of the face mask, and when she quit moving, even that faint tickle of noise ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was standing on an incline, and she could see a place downhill where the incline increased sharply—dropping off and out of sight. At the edges of the drop-off, there were stalls filled with empty bins. And off to the side, and up, as Briar explored the scene with her eyes, she saw the remains of a half-toppled sign and an enormous clock without any hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this must be… “The market. I’m near Pike Street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost said it aloud, but then merely mouthed the observation. The street made a dead end at the market, and on the other side of the market was the Sound—or it would’ve been, if the wall hadn’t cut the shoreline away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building at her back must face Commercial Avenue, the street that once ran alongside the ocean and now ran alongside the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next few blocks, any of the streets that paralleled Pike would take her in roughly the direction she’d chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged close to the building, aiming rifle and eyes up and down the street as she shuffled sideways. Breathing inside the mask hadn’t become any easier, but she was growing accustomed to it and there was no alternative, anyway. Her chest was sore from the extra effort her muscles were making to inflate and deflate her lungs, and down at one corner of her left eyepiece, the view was getting foggy from condensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeading uphill ever so slightly, she worked her way away from the wall, which she couldn’t even see. Briar knew that its tall blank shadow reached up into the sky, but it vanished from view far sooner and it was easy to forget, especially when she’d turned away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough her head ran endless calculations. How far was she from the lavender house on the hill? How long would it take to reach it if she ran? If she walked? If she skulked like this, squeezing between the tendrils of low-lying, stinking fog?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flexed her cheek, trying to shake the condensation and make it gather or roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t work. The vapor clung to the mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, and a second sigh gave it a funny echo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, she shook her face. It must have been a trick of the straps, or the way the device fit around her forehead. It could’ve been her hair, brushing against the exterior. It might’ve been her boots, scraping unexpectedly against a jagged paving stone. The sound could’ve come from anywhere. It was so quiet, anyway. Hardly a sound at all, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer feet wouldn’t move. Neither would her arms, or her hands, locked around the rifle. Even her neck would barely turn, lest she recreate the noise, or fail to. The only thing worse than hearing it again would be hearing it again and knowing it hadn’t come from her own careful movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo slowly that even her long coat didn’t tap itself against her legs, Briar retreated, feeling with her heels, praying that there was nothing behind her. Her heel found a curb, and stopped there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped up onto it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound came again. There was a whistle to it, and a moan. It was almost a hiss, and it could’ve been a strangled gasp. Above all, it was quiet, and it seemed to have no source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar tried to place the sound, and she decided, now that she’d heard it again and could be certain she hadn’t imagined it, that it came from somewhere to her left, down toward the wall. It was coming from the street stalls where nothing had been bought or sold in almost sixteen years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whisper rose to a hum, and then stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar stopped too—or she would have, if she hadn’t already. She wanted to freeze herself further, to make herself inaudible and invisible, but there was nowhere to hide—not in her immediate range of vision. The deep old stalls were behind her. All the doors were barred with boards nailed tight around them, and all the windows had likewise been covered. The corner of a stone building pressed against her shoulder when she leaned away from the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis new kind of quiet was even more frightening than the old kind, which was simply empty. Now it was worse, because the foggy, cluttered landscape was not merely silent. Now it was holding its breath, and listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar removed her left hand from the rifle and reached backward until she touched the corner. Finding it, and feeling it, she guided herself to the far side of the building. It was no real protection, but it put her out of the market’s line of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mask was squeezing tight around her face. The condensation on one side was driving her to distraction, and the smell of rubber and toast clogged her throat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boneshaker-the-clockwork-century-1/page-22.html","bookId":2550,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:52 AM"}
