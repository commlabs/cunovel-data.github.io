This differed from the Gate of Healing, which managed endurance and restorative ability, and the Gate of Limit, which handled balance, coordinated strength, and explosive force. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis newly opened gate would be able to increase one’s combat effectiveness far more directly than the first two gates.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSpeed was one of the most important factors of a martial artist’s comprehensive combat strength.

A martial artist’s own speed could superimpose on the speed of their own attacks. If their attacks were fast enough, then even a tiny stone rock could easily pierce through the body. If Lin Ming poured his battle spirit into his attacks as the foundation, then the resulting power would be even more terrifying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming left the cave, sealing the entrance on his way out.

As he felt himself reaching such extreme speeds, Lin Ming was elated beyond measure; the extreme velocity of the Gate of Wonder completely surpassing his imagination.

He came across a massive canyon and thrust his spear into the 10,000 foot high cliffs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming pierced the cliffside like tofu, penetrating all the way until he poked out from the other side!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s spear move was founded on the limits of his speed, along with the dual Concepts of Thunder and Fire, and the keenness of his battle spirit. With such a combination, even the cliff side that had been strengthened by a baptism of being near the Sea of Miracles had been pierced through by Lin Ming’s spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRustle…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lin Ming soared out from the hole several feet wide that he had left in the middle of the mountain cliff, a great puff of stone powder plumed from within. Underneath the Concept of Fire’s Law of Annihilation, the crushed stones turned into dust, blowing and dancing into the wind. For a while, the entire cliff canyon was covered in a faint hazy dust cloud.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My strength has increased yet again after opening the third of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates.

However, it was impossible for him to exchange any of those things for spirit essence stones. None of his other remaining possessions were too valuable either.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming killed Xuan Wuji and the Polar Skysplit Tower master, he had managed to accumulate a good deal of wealth. Relative to his current level, however, all of that wealth was close to nothing at all.

The only reason that he had managed to concoct the Fivefade Void Pill in less than half a year was because he had practiced without caution or care of burning through any of his materials. Only by freely spending all sorts of precious and materials in his practice had he been able to forcefully raise his skill at alchemy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of practice method would only burn money; it was impossible for him to ever make money.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSkyflower Province, Blue Cloud City –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSkyflower Province was the smallest of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s nine provinces. However, its prosperity and success was second to only the Central Province. All of the major forces had gathered here within the Skyflower Province’s capital, Blue Cloud City, which was also the headquarters of the Hundred Treasures Auction House. In every square, there were countless treasure pavilions and medicinal pill shops. This city could even be called as being paved with gold.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe majority of the young martial artists strolling down the streets were all outstanding individuals.

Because this restaurant was close to a large auction house, most of the customers here were martial artists.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming wore his wood spirit jade mask and casually sat in a corner of the restaurant as he ordered a few small dishes of various vicious beast meats and spirit vegetables. He lifted the corner of his wood spirit mask and ate at a moderate pace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, a conversation that several martial artists were having suddenly caught his attention.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Have you heard of that uproarious news that came out about Lin Lanjian a few days ago?” A 30-40 year old man with a cherry red face said as he took big gulps of wine.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who doesn’t know him? With his late Revolving Core cultivation, he was able to kill Corpsemancer and rank on the Destiny Decree. He was named an eternally rare talent!” A big fellow’s words immediately attracted a laugh from all the martial artists around him. He looked back at the drinking man and said, “Are you a foreigner here?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the most recent news to come out.” The drinking man cleared his throat, gathering everyone’s attention to him. Then, with an air of self-importance he said, “Lin Lanjian’s cultivation method was confirmed to have been stolen from the Asura Divine Kingdom. Additionally, the armor he wore is a sacred treasure of the Asura Divine Kingdom. They had thought that it was lost a long time ago, but it had actually fallen into Lin Lanjian’s hands!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What!? Lin Lanjian stole his cultivation method from the Asura Divine Kingdom? Are you sure of this?” The surrounding martial artists were shocked. This was a major event. Whether it was a sect or\u0026nbsp;a\u0026nbsp;Divine Kingdom, their most important treasures were their inheritances. Once these inheritances were leaked to the outside world, then this would cause their very foundation to shake!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a matter that any Holy Land or Divine Kingdom would absolutely never tolerate. Thus, to any person that stole their cultivation, there was only a single judgement for them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat was – death!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is absolutely true. It’s said that Lin Lanjian or his master killed some important person from the Asura Divine Kingdom and stole away their spatial ring. This spatial ring contained the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’ jade slip!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So it’s like that!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll the surrounding martial artists seemed to believe this, even if just a little. Since the Asura Divine Kingdom said that Lin Lanjian’s cultivation method was stolen from them, then there must be some similarities between Lin Lanjian’s cultivation method and their own. It was impossible for them to make up stories about this sort of matter. Otherwise, if Lin Lanjian’s cultivation method was completely different from the Asura Divine Kingdom’s ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’, then these rumors would collapse in on themselves after being proven false.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’ was a secret inheritance of the Asura Divine Kingdom. No matter how powerful Lin Lanjian or his master was, it would be impossible for them to break into the vaults of the Asura Divine Kingdom and steal away their inheritance. Thus, the only other explanation was that they killed a direct descendent of the Asura Divine Kingdom and then obtained a jade slip of the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough many martial artists also wanted to do this, this was simply a disgraceful and shameful matter once exposed. Now, all of the present martial artists felt that there was something questionable about Lin Lanjian’s morals. It was likely that he was a corrupt and underhanded individual.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fact, the majority of martial artists believed this. At least, most of those in this restaurant believed this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What’s the deal with that armor that Lin Lanjian wears?” Another martial artist continued to ask.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That is the Demon Emperor Armor. The Asura Divine Kingdom already has the Demon Emperor Armor’s heartguard mirror, which happens to completely match with Lin Lanjian’s armor! The armor has already been lost for countless years by now, and to think that it actually appeared with Lin Lanjian! There’s definitely some problem with this Lin Lanjian!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the martial artist’s discussion fell into Lin Ming’s ears. He calmly listened the entire time as he slowly ate his food. The Asura Divine Kingdom’s actions were far more shameless than he had imagined they would be. They had released such rumors in order to galvanize more people into looking for him. Another reason for such rumors was to make up some self-righteous reason to take away his belongings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe general public was much more likely to believe a Divine Kingdom with a ‘long and glorious inheritance’ than they were to believe a lone and unknown martial artist like Lin Ming. After all, the idea that the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’ and the ‘Demon Emperor Armor’ belonged to the Asura Divine Kingdom had already deeply rooted itself into the hearts of the people.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It looks like the Asura Divine Kingdom has already set their eyes on me.

The warrant for his arrest had already been sent out; it should be posted any time now. It is said that the Asura Divine Kingdom will reward 100,000 spirit essence stones for anyone that can give them clues to Lin Lanjian’s whereabouts. If one can capture Lin Lanjian alive, then they will give them a sky high reward of 300,000 spirit essence stones, top quality pills, and even a peak medium-grade heaven-step treasure!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe big fellow’s words sent the hearts of all the martial artists present rapidly fluttering.
