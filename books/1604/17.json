I will do anything to get her back. It seems it has become my centennial project. I wonder if I will ever just have the people who have become my new family all together, or if I will die still looking for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did they take her?\" I ask again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge boys hug and rub each other\u0027s hair. I want to shout but Will saves me the trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks around, \"Where\u0027s Anna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunters got her two days ago. She went looking for Emma and I heard her screaming at the edge of the field. I couldn’t run. They took her in a truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. \"Emma you went for food after you went for medicine to save me. None of this is your fault. We\u0027ll get her back.\" He looks at Will and smiles. It amazes me how much they look alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re alive man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ruffles his hair again, \"You too little bro. You should have died a long time ago with your survival skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake blushes and laughs, \"Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get her back Jakey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t laugh with them. I can\u0027t pretend that everything is warm and fuzzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove him. \"So how did you end up here? Why didn’t you stay at the farmhouse in the barn bunker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to go after them. I went over the hill and broke the branches like you told me. I knew you\u0027d find me.\" He shakes his head at Will. \"She\u0027s like a fucking terminator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill laughs, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake fixes his hair, \"Anyway I came here yesterday. They all know you Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shrugs, \"I made friends at camp, just like I always did Jakey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate the way he calls him Jakey. I hate him in a horrid way. I wish he was at the breeder camp and Anna was with us. Him and his girlfriend in the shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey have their mini reunion. I turn away and walk to the nearest small tent. I look in the flap. A younger looking guy is asleep inside. Half his face is burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk from one small tent to the next, until I find one with a barrel-chested man with red hair holding a pen and looking at a map that’s spread across a table, \"Are you Marshall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, but looks suspiciously at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to know where the closest breeder camp is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles, \"Little girl you aren’t thinking about volunteering are you? The food\u0027s not that bad here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t laugh I look at the map. I don’t know how to read maps. I add it to the list of things he should have taught me, before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops laughing and raises his eyebrows, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friend was taken. I need her back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts laughing again, \"What do you plan on doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up into his older gray eyes and his bright red beard and stare him down, \"I\u0027m going to get her back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratches the back of his fuzzy red head, \"Look kid I get you\u0027re upset but there is no getting them back. They go in and nine years later they get a nice house in the city. It\u0027s not a bad gig. They get healthy food and a place to sleep. Your life here is harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my face change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his hands up defensively, \"Look we have bigger fish to fry than worry about one girl at a breeder farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his back on me and looks at the wall of the tent where other maps are hung. I feel my fingers twitch. I want to pull an arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the tent disheartened and lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma where did you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at Will and Jake walking toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrunch up my face and walk away from them both. I don’t know how to be dramatic. I feel the need burning inside of me, but I don’t physically know how to get angry without using my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to a group of ladies who are standing around a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile sweetly and look at the one who looks the most like my mother did, \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raises her eyebrows and the corners of her mouth at the same time, \"Hi sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rebellion people are nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where the nearest breeder camp is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowns, \"Yeah.\" She looks over at a dark strawberry blonde who has a scar along her mouth, \"Beth where was that camp that you all saw not far from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"South east, over two small mountains and a ghost town. Used to be a place called Lincoln there. Stay on the outskirts of that place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Thanks so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren’t trying to go there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No way. Just wanted to know where my friend went. Her nine years is almost up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady with the scar laughs bitterly, \"Honey she aint coming back out here to shit in a ditch. She\u0027ll get herself a nice place in the city. I hear they even got air conditioning again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lady with a t-shirt with a big tongue on it laughs, \"Oh girl, what I would do for air conditioning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all laugh and it makes me grin. I walk away from them and go back to the small tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looks less than pleased I am there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, you\u0027re back again. Look kid I\u0027m not sending a bunch of men to their death over some girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk, \"I\u0027m not asking you for a thing. I just want to see the map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds him arm out at the one on the table, \"Have at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the compass on the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drops a fat finger onto the map next to a blue line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drag my finger southeast to the place that says Lincoln. I look up at him, \"Which way is south east from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points to the back of the tent where the other maps are. He\u0027s blocking my view of them purposely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"thanks.\" I walk in the direction he\u0027s told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy quiver isn\u0027t very full. Normally I make arrows once a month but I haven’t had a chance in the last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing has been the way it would have been back at the cabin. I think about the moment I stood at the door as Anna knocked outside of it. I remember the regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Will and Jake. I walk faster. I don’t know what to say, but running away from them seems like a pretty good idea. Jake still limps from the branch, but they move quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em wait up.\" Jake\u0027s voice picks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to be alone. It figures the only boys I\u0027ve ever liked have to be brothers. My mom would have been proud. She too had a thing for brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers bite my arm and spin me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill towers over me, \"What are you doing?\" He looks annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my arm from him, \"I\u0027m going to find her.\" I look at Jake, \"Stay here and get better. That leg wound isn’t going to heal with you traipsing all over hell\u0027s half acre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill grabs my arm again, \"Em we aren’t going to let you run off half cocked. We need a plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel angry, maybe because I like them both and maybe because they\u0027re not running after her, like I expected they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at Jake, \"When you fell in that hole she did the bravest thing I have ever seen anyone do. She told me that she didn’t care if I shot her but I had to come find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"We need a plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point south, \"There\u0027s probably a three day hike, we can plan on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s grip on my arm tightens, \"We will be down a mountain and in the woods alone with no resources when we find her. What plan can you come up with there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head again. \"I\u0027ve made it this far without anyone.\" I pull my arm free and take a step back, \"I don’t need either of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel something in my stomach. I should have grabbed food. I start my hike. I realize I not only have no plan but that I\u0027m starving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear their footsteps behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s really stubborn.\" Jake tries to whispers but I hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did notice that. How\u0027s the leg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make a face but don’t look back at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. She did surgery on it. I don’t think I\u0027ll ever win the Boston Marathon if it comes back in style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill snorts. I want to laugh but I\u0027m pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anna been a handful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake laughs, \"Oh my god. The year she started the road to womanhood was the beginning of the end. Oh my god it was bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my face flush with heat. I remember getting my first menstruation and cringe. I had thought I was dying for a few days. I read granny\u0027s encyclopedia to health and found the answers I\u0027d been seeking. I made rags and stayed indoors. I rubbed the clary sage oil on my stomach for the cramping like the book said and put warm compresses on my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first thing I added to the list of things he should have told me about. Being twelve and alone in the forest was daunting. Bleeding every month for no reason was much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize how far ahead of them I am when I come out of my daydream and can\u0027t hear them. I look back. They are laughing and walking like it\u0027s a stroll in the park. I glance up in the trees to see the guards placed strategically. I know we are still safe from the others but I can\u0027t imagine laughing and joking and catching up the way they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk faster. I miss the silence and uncomplicated days of traveling with Leo. He would hunt and we would touch each other every now and again but neither of us needed to make a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at Jake again and notice the way he lumbers through the woods. I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom of the mountain leads to a valley. I climb a tree and sit up in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A highway. There are cars on it, they\u0027re burned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt frightens me. Scavengers are always nearest to the old remains. I stay away from the remains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see movement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head but narrow my eyes to improve my vision. The sick have a way of not moving when you need them to. The sun is going down. I want to cross the highway and be halfway up the next mountain before it\u0027s completely dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb down the tree and try not to look at either of the hulking men standing next to me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-17.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
