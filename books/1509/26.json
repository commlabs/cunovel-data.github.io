Day in and day out with the client, always by their side, constantly on your toes. The key factor was time, because poor timing could mean someone’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeus, the untouchable master of the mercenary world, had served before as a body guard for two years. It was intolerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he become a mercenary in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Ninth Level Talent, God-Ranked Mecha-Pilot, infinite possibilities… why choose the life of a mercenary? It was simple, really – freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus Lan Jue rarely returned home, he couldn’t stand the constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimply said this condition set by Zhou Qianlin went against his very nature, indeed he couldn’t comply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took up the enameled pot, pouring himself another small cup of tea. He replaced it and took another sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something else,” Lan Jue said in ill temper. When in her presence, even if he didn’t realize it, he hardly seemed like a noble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need.” Zhou Qianlin stood. “A man who fails to keep his promise, what use could I have for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she spoke, she moved towards the door to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You!” Lan Jue jumped to his feet, grabbing her wrist. “What on earth do you want?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared cruelly at him. “What do I want? I told you what I want, but since you can’t agree then forget it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what happened between us…” he began in hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin yanked her hand away and stood toe to toe with him, staring fiercely in to his eyes. Lan Jue unconsciously took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was like being sat on by a pig.” She spat the sentence at him, turned on her heel and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue felt like a victim of his own Lightning Discipline, standing there frozen for a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!” After a few moments he finally reacted, running outside. He ran nearly headlong in to the waitress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, you haven’t settled the bill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paid hurriedly and hastened outside. He finally caught up with Zhou Qianlin at the door to the Luo Yun teahouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop right there!” Lan Jue shouted at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin lin spun around, regarding him calmly. “You have something to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-you…!” lightning rippled in Lan Jue’s eyes, clearly on the verge of erupting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head, scorn evident in her beautiful sky-blue eyes. “What’s the matter? Ashamed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue loosened his tightened fists, stepping back. “Ask for something else!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin turned once again and began to walk off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Lan Jue did not pursue, watching her slender form vanish around a nearby corner. He couldn’t stop his fists from clenching once more. He was finding it difficult to contain his emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the corner Zhou Qianlin had stopped when out of sight, leaning against the wall. She covered her red face with her hands, gasping headily through her open mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure was immense, and she felt as though in that moment there still burned the heat of those two large hands pressing down on her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a laugh burst unbidden from her lips. The whole scene was too much! Sat on by a pig!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHah! He’s got to be so pissed!\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWhat choice does the honorable and respected Zeus have?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same instant Lan Jue was returning to Zeus’ Jewelry Store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing his infuriated face, Xiuxiu and Ke’er gulped. The expression in his eyes was stranger still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue said not a word, going directly to his room. He needed to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s he so upset with? He looks so… ugly,” Ke’er said, wide-eyed and open-mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu shook her head. “It’s the first time I’ve seen him this angry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he entered the room Lan Jue flopped down atop his bed, his head resounding with Zhou Qianlin’s pleasant voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bodyguard!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sat on by a pig!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two phrases echoed over and over in his mind. He knew that had someone else spoke to him like that he’d have incinerated them. But not Zhou Qianlin, she was his Jinyu’s sister, and he still…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly, this request was nearly impossible to accept. To be beside her every day as a bodyguard. How could anyone who values freedom live like that? And it was more than two years – the length of her schooling, at least two years and three months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, impossible! Regardless of the circumstances, impossible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet to refuse was to go against his own moral code. In the heat of the moment they never discussed terms. Moreover he was the one that had taken her innocence. If he didn’t make recompense it would be like a thorn in his heart forever, like a fish bone caught in the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time Zou Qianlin was also lying in her bed, covered by a light pink gauze curtain. Her room was constructed like an ocean of flowers. Lying atop the soft bed, her eyes were hazy, filled with several emotions, her mind in a constant state of flux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill he accept? If he doesn’t, what then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBeep, beep, beep!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin nearly leapt from the bed, but sputtered when she saw he number on her communicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Mi, what is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eTang Mi!\u003c/em\u003e” came the agitated shout from the communicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, fine. Tang Mi,” Zhou Qianlin responded helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you’ll be returning to classes next week. Are you sure everything’s alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin responded, “What do you mean alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mood,” Tang Mi said. “After something like this you certainly can’t forget it right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin snorted. “I forget about it ages ago. I’ll return to class next week. Let me copy your notes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Mi chuckled. “You really want to forget then that’s fine. I’m telling you though, you aren’t allowed to have any sort of relationship with my idol. I’ll be a mercenary myself, the beautiful woman chasing the every step of the Mercenary King, you wont be able to compete with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go then, meet a man and lose all your friends.” She unceremoniously hung up the communicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBeep, beep, beep\u003c/em\u003e the communicator rang anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin impatiently answered. “I won’t compete with you, alright? He\u0027s all yours!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Compete with what,” a surprised voice answered from the communicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin sat up. “Is it you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response was low, simple, like it required a great deal of courage to utter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re request… I accept.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-25\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-27\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-26","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:06 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:06 AM"}
