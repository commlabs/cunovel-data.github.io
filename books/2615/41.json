She looked away from him, her hand resting on her bosom. “Lady Astir feeds on the emotions that fill her haven. She grants the supernatural creatures and mortals within her haven their greatest desire and is empowered by their emotions. She is, in her own way, a vampire, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are weakened by the vampires not being in the haven,” I said, understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am weakened by no supernaturals being in the haven!” She stood up and clutched her hands tightly before her. “They are all staying away because of this damned vampire war which I desire to be over! It has gone on far too long! And if Ignatius were to return, Gavril would see it as a threat and it would escalate once more! Ignatius cannot return until Gavril does not see him as a menace to his sovereignty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How does this concern me? I don’t understand!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are watching you as well, countess! You are Vlad’s wife and he is not in the city. They suspect you are his spy, his minion, watching for their weaknesses. Yes, Vlad killed Baatar, but only once Baatar was in battle with Gavril and Ilinca. Vlad was fighting on Baatar’s side and switched allegiances. Despite this, they do not trust him, which is actually quite wise of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He won’t do anything. He can’t!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they do not know that!” Astir turned about and flung out her hands dramatically. “As far as they know, he could be creating a vampire army to swoop down and kill them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my face, overwhelmed by my fragile position in the world. I was trapped in a far more tangled web than I had ever imagined. It was made even more complex by my own actions against Vlad Dracula. If he were here, he would know exactly how to deal with Ilinca and Gavril. I was lost without him and I grieved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The vampire who sought to kill Vlad on the road to Buda, he was of the House of Baatar. He sought revenge,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I delivered his head to Gavril and Ilinca as a gift from Vlad hoping that it would dissuade them from suspecting him. It mollified them for a while. And then Ilinca saw you and here we are.” Astir flung up her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how do we resolve this issue?” I looked up at Astir, feeling humbled by all I now knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Continue as before.” Astir sighed and handed me a kerchief to wipe way the remains of my earlier tears. “Do as I said. Be a mortal countess in all ways. If Ilinca or Gavril approach you, tell them you do not know where your husband is. That he sent you to the city to stay with your friend and you are uncertain of when he will return. Pretend to have an empty head and a frivolous heart. Cower before them if you have to, but do nothing that would make them believe you are a threat. So far they appear to be satisfied that you have no designs against them. If we are lucky, they will not know that Ignatius was here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can he return?” I felt so lost. I may have to leave Buda to be with him and I felt certain that would be fraught with difficulties as well. I was surprised to realize it would wound me deeply to leave behind Laura and Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He will need to negotiate with Gavril. It is the only way.” Astir reached down to grip my trembling hand. “I do not want to cause you pain, my dear little vampire. I am your greatest ally and most loving friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed at her words, not truly believing them. “Are you, Astir? Or are you feeding off me now as we speak?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes flashing dangerously, she drew away. “Adem will stay with you until this danger is passed. Apparently,” she gave him a dark look, “he prefers your company and Magda’s to his wife’s.” With the wave of her hands, she vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting about in my chair, I said in a gasp, “Wife?” as Magda echoed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger flushed his face and he nodded curtly. “Yes, my wife. She lives in the haven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Magda rushed from the room, the door slamming behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding up, I pointed an accusing finger at Adem. “I care for you, but she is dear to my heart. Do not hurt her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will explain it to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I may be a wanton woman, but Magda is pure in heart and deed! Did you know Vlad killed her husband? That she has mourned for him for years while remaining Vlad’s faithful servant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not want to cause her pain. I have only recently spoken of my love to her. It is fresh and new. It was not the time to tell her that I am cursed to immortality because of a foolish pact I made with Astir long ago because I could not allow my wife to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explain it to me,” I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saadat was dying. She had given birth to a son that did not live beyond the first hour of his life. The bleeding would not stop. I knew of Astir by reputation. It was said that she was an angel of Allah. I carried Saadat to the place where I was told Astir could hear my prayers. Astir did come and told me that in her haven Saadat would never die, but she could never leave. I begged to go with her, unable to bear life without her. Astir vowed that if I swore my fealty to her, she would allow me into the haven. I would also be immortal, but would be allowed to leave the haven should Astir desire it.” Adem sat down heavily in the chair I had perched upon earlier and rubbed his scarred face with his hands. “That was many hundreds of years ago. Saadat and I were happy for a portion of them, but the haven corrupted her slowly. She gave herself up to the pleasures of the haven and spurned me. I begged her to leave the haven with me, knowing that to leave without Astir’s permission would mean both of our deaths. I thought if we repented of our sin, Allah would forgive us. Saadat refused to leave. A little of her love for me must have remained for she never told Astir what I asked of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you are just as lonely as I am.” I touched his shoulder, my anger dissipating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love Magda, countess, but we are just as damned as you and your love are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go tell her, Adem. Tell her the truth.” I felt drained and tired all at once. I needed some time to be alone and gather my thoughts. It was plain to see that I had been oblivious to quite a lot of what had been happening around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, he bowed quickly, then followed after Magda. I fought the impulse to embrace him and attempt to comfort him. From the set of his shoulders and expression, I could see he was just as tormented as I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door shut behind him, I fell back into my chair. In silence, I pondered all I had learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctober 3, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the difficult emotional aftermath of the evening, all thoughts of Vlad were swept away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHungry, I summoned the Baroness to my chamber. This time I took more blood than my previous sips. She swooned as I fed and fell unconscious upon my couch. I left her and sat alone in my bedroom, contemplating the night’s events. I brooded in my misery, feeling trapped by Astir’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when Adem returned with Magda, he carried the Baroness to her room. Moody, I retired early to bed. This act did not give me the comfort I yearned for. I could smell Ignatius upon my bedclothes and the memory of his touch filled me with great longing. Heartbroken, I cried myself to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no dream this time. No slow seduction in my bed. I awoke when I was slapped so soundly my ears rung. Gasping, I could see the apparition of Vlad Dracula over my bed. I barely had time to fully understand the event that was unfolding when his phantom hand gripped me about the throat and flung me across the room. My body struck the wall with such violence the plaster broke and rained down around me. Clinging to the wall with my power, I scurried up into the corner feeling my cold blood seeping through my hair and down my spine. Frantically, I searched the room for the attacking phantom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad’s misty form materialized below me and seized my ankle. Wrenching me off the wall, he tossed me over the canopy of the bed and I hurtled into my vanity. It splintered into pieces beneath my body. My cosmetics crashed to the floor and the powders billowed into the air like mist, their sweet smell filling my nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to my room was tossed open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess!” Adem cried out, gripping a silver dagger in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda brushed past him and gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shattered remains of my vanity bit into my skin as I crawled out of the wreckage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Vlad!” I warned them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda’s face turned ashen as Adem raised his dagger higher. Sweeping his eyes over the room, Adem sought out my attacker, his body poised for battle. Magda rushed to help me to my feet, her long hair falling around her stricken face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad’s apparition appeared just before Magda reached my side. She screamed as he blocked her way and fell back in an attempt to evade him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Traitor!” he snarled at her. His shadowy form dismissed her with a savage look, then gripped my throat in both his hands. “Release me from my coffin and I will forgive you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no need for breath, but I knew he could rip my head from my shoulders. Frightened, I attempted to fight him. My hands and feet passed through his spectral body like vapor, but the hands about my throat felt like iron. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-41.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
