Wait.” He moved down my body as I gaped at him in absolute confusion, but then he said, “There was one more thing I wanted to do before you...” He didn’t bother to finish his explanation. He pressed his mouth between my legs and licked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed and bucked against him. He shoved his fingers deep, swirled his tongue over a knotted bundle of nerves, and I came so hard I went lightheaded and slightly oxygen deprived. But the bolts of energy radiating from me felt so freaking good, I rode the high, not even caring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I came down, I felt limp and satiated, ready to pass out and sleep for a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnox blew out a breath and collapsed beside me, lying on his side so he could watch me. I rolled onto my side so I could face him too. We grinned like idiots at each other until we started to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I held up a hand. “Okay, I just have to say...I freaking love third base.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and kissed my lips in the moonlight. “Yeah, so do I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, studying his beautiful, perfect face as he pulled back. “How’d you ever know to do something like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “My dad watches a lot of porn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” I bit my lip, my thoughts swirling. Then I whispered, “Knox?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lashes fluttered as if he could pass out too. Then he murmured, “Hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I confess something to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes opening, he nodded. “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My brothers watch a lot of porn too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached between us and snapped open the top button of his jeans, he sucked in a breath. “City?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered the zipper slowly. “Can I do to you what you just did to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh...” Words seemed to fail him as I slipped my hand into the opening and clutched him through his underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the answer you’re looking for is yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned as I stroked him. “Yes. Oh...fuck. Yes, okay. But only if you want to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I want to. I want to so very, very badly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping a hand over his face, he watched as I drew him free of his underwear, then he lifted his hips so I could push his clothes out of the way. When I returned to his cock, I was amazed at how soft it was over the hardness beneath the surface. The slit at the end of the mushroomed head seeped a syrupy drop, so I leaned down and licked it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reacted violently, clutching my hair and surging his hips up. But a second later, he slammed his butt back to the dock under him. “Sorry, sorry. Did I hurt you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. In fact,” I took his hand and placed it back in my hair. “I kind of liked that response.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I put my mouth around the entire head. The groan that followed and his grip in my hair told me just how much he liked it. So I moved down, taking in more. All I really knew was that I was supposed to suck and not bite. Wrapping my lips around my teeth, I used suction to pull him in deeper. He shuddered, every muscle in him seeming to spasm out of control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fucking hell,” he gritted out. “I’m not going to last long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out some only to suck as much as I could handle back in. It didn’t take long to learn from his reactions that he liked speed and pressure, and lots of suction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“City. I’m gonna... God, I’m gonna come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited I was doing it right, I picked up the pace, but he clutched my hair hard and pulled me off him. Gripping the base, he pumped furiously for two or three strokes before cream shot out over his stomach. I gaped at how much came out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God,” he said, thumping the back of his head on the dock as he tried to regulate his breathing. “That was...so much better than masturbating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned because his shock and pleasure was adorable. “Thanks for pulling me off at the end,” I said, glancing at the stream of semen pooled on his stomach. “I didn’t realize there would be quite that much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and looked down at it too. “Yeah, I didn’t figure you should swallow the first time out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I agreed, beginning to frown. “How’re we supposed to clean it off?” I glanced at my dress, then my underwear, knowing it would be noble to let him use either of those to wipe his stomach clean, but...eww. I just couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my expression amused him. He laughed again. “Well, there is a large body of water right there. What do you say to...skinny-dipping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at the idea. “Well, I am already naked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his jeans shoved down to his thighs. “And I could get there soon.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-97.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
