Peggy guessed she\u0027d needed several days to work up her courage to discuss the matter of her staying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do that later,\" Peggy suggested. \"I was thinking we might go out to lunch when we\u0027re finished here.\" She found the best \"girl talks\" with Hollie always took place over lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah smiled. \"That would be nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had been with them for more than a week. She\u0027d planned to leave once, about three days after her arrival, but Peggy had asked her to stay. As she\u0027d expected, Hannah had accepted the invitation without further argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, they sat on the patio at The Lighthouse eating Caesar salad with grilled shrimp and sipping iced tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Bob have been so kind to me,\" Hannah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still seemed frail, Peggy noted, physically as well as emotionally. \"We like having you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked grateful. \"I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s ever been so good to me.\" She reached for her iced tea and took a quick sip. \"I should never have stayed this long. Originally I only intended to visit Cedar Cove for one night. But you were so welcoming, and now it\u0027s been over a week. I can\u0027t continue to take advantage of your friendship like this.\" She met Peggy\u0027s eyes and said earnestly, \"I do think of you as my friends, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We feel the same way,\" Peggy murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was nibbling her lower lip again. Peggy considered it a personal challenge to improve not only this girl\u0027s health but her emotional outlook. She didn\u0027t seem to have much self-esteem. Generally, Peggy thought parents worried excessively about self-esteem these days. Spend enough time with your kids, give them lots of love and reasonable amounts of responsibility, and self-esteem would naturally follow—that was Peggy\u0027s theory of child-raising. But in Hannah Russell\u0027s case... She was far too thin—to the point of being anorexic. Her clothes hung on her. Peggy had taken a lot of pleasure in tempting Hannah with her prize recipes. Ever since Troy Davis\u0027s last visit, she\u0027d been cooking many of her old favorites. She found comfort in that and in providing Hannah with some old-fashioned mothering. Hannah seemed to blossom under Peggy\u0027s encouragement and affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bob and I want you to stay,\" Peggy said, wondering how many times she\u0027d have to make this point. \"We love having you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shook her head reluctantly. \"I can\u0027t do that. I\u0027m not even sure why I came to Cedar Cove. In the beginning I told myself it was because I wanted to learn what I could about how—and why—my father died. I don\u0027t like to think about him suffering.\" There was a stricken look in her eyes. \"You don\u0027t think he suffered much, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy didn\u0027t know, but she felt a need to reassure Hannah, even if it wasn\u0027t the truth. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. When Bob and I broke into the room, there wasn\u0027t any evidence of restlessness.\" It was as if Maxwell Russell had laid his head on the pillow, closed his eyes and never stirred again. All in all, it wasn\u0027t a bad way to exit this life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah picked at her salad. \"I thought I had some questions, but I don\u0027t. I probably should. I know that Mr. McAfee seemed to have a lot—but I don\u0027t. I\u0027m not sure I even want to know what happened. All I really want is for this nightmare to go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy wasn\u0027t surprised by her feelings. Sometimes, for some people, uncertainty was easier to live with than a difficult truth. Hannah was obviously one of those people, preferring to simply avoid reality. Peggy had felt that temptation herself, but knew she was strong enough to cope with the truth, whatever it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt drawn to Cedar Cove,\" Hannah went on. \"I was driving and driving, looking for a fresh start, and all I could think about was my first visit here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s understandable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Hannah sounded genuinely curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for one thing, your father died in Cedar Cove. It\u0027s here that the mystery will be solved and although you may not want to know what happened or why, you need to know. That\u0027s what your mind is telling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think so?\" Hannah asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...think I was drawn back here because of you and Bob.\" She smiled fleetingly. \"When Sheriff Davis brought me to your house, you were so helpful and so nice to me. I felt...oh, I don\u0027t know, that you were just the kind of family I wish I\u0027d had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman\u0027s words gladdened Peggy\u0027s heart, and saddened her at the same time. Obviously Hannah\u0027s childhood had been lacking in some crucial ways. Peggy felt a stab of longing for her own children. She saw her daughter so rarely that Hannah\u0027s warmth and gratitude made up for some of what she was missing with Hollie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay,\" Hannah said decisively, \"but only on one condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome without any conditions,\" Peggy assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to pay you rent, just as if I was any other guest. I\u0027ll need to find a job first, of course, but that shouldn\u0027t be too hard. I have lots of experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy thought it was important for Hannah to pay rent; it would allow her to feel a sense of pride and self-sufficiency. \"I understand Grace is planning to hire someone at the library for the summer,\" she said. \"Why not apply there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah considered that for a moment, then shook her head. \"I\u0027m not much of a reader, unfortunately. I don\u0027t know how good I\u0027d be at helping people find books, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy wasn\u0027t easily discouraged. \"What jobs have you held in the past?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I worked all through high school at a fast-food place. I didn\u0027t really like it, but it gave me a little bit of money. My dad...\" She paused and let whatever she\u0027d started to say fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about working in a day care center? Little Lambs recently advertised for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Hannah shook her head. \"I don\u0027t have a lot of patience around little kids. I worked at a Laundromat once, too, but only briefly. I think I\u0027d be good as a store clerk, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you would, too,\" Peggy agreed and Hannah brightened immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check the Help Wanted listings as soon as we get back to the house,\" Hannah said eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. We\u0027ll pick up a Chronicle right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy paid for their lunch, and when they arrived back at the house, Bob was there to help her unload the minivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah\u0027s decided to live with us for a while,\" she told her husband, making a point of expressing her pleasure at the girl\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I plan to pay my own way,\" Hannah insisted. Clutching her newspaper, she followed Bob into the garage, where he set down the thirty-pound bag of fertilizer. \"First thing Monday morning, I\u0027m going to apply for a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob nodded, but he didn\u0027t reveal nearly the enthusiasm Peggy had. She wanted to kick him for his obvious lack of interest. Peggy watched as Hannah\u0027s face fell, annoyed that her husband was so blind to how badly the girl needed their approval. Hannah was fragile and needy, and it wasn\u0027t that difficult to give her some of the attention she craved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be any bother.\" Hannah nervously stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re no bother, Hannah.\" Bob returned to the minivan. Well, at least he\u0027d said that much and his voice wasn\u0027t unfriendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to help with dinner, Hannah?\" Peggy called as she headed into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...of course.\" Hannah scurried after her. \"I want to do whatever I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so eager to please and so eager to fit in. She agreed to prepare the potatoes with every sign of happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Hannah stood at the kitchen sink and peeled potatoes, working carefully and methodically, Bob walked in through the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a visitor,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy automatically dried her hands on the kitchen towel as Pastor Dave Flemming entered the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Peggy,\" he said, smiling broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePastor Flemming and Bob had become friends over the past year or so. Max Russell\u0027s death had shaken Bob and Peggy badly, and they\u0027d started going to church again, something they hadn\u0027t done in years. They still attended regularly. Peggy felt it had been a good decision; the services brought her a sense of peace and calm, and she was thankful for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Hannah Russell,\" Bob said, gesturing toward Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Hannah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" she said softly, her gaze lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl had trouble making eye contact, Peggy noticed, and hoped that with time and lots of attention she\u0027d get over being so timid and self-conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bob tells me you\u0027re staying here for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah nodded. \"Mr. and Mrs. Beldon have been very kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to invite you to join us on Sunday for worship service. The Beldons attend. You could go with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flew up. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be comfortable with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any particular reason?\" Pastor Flemming asked. \"It\u0027s our goal to make every visitor welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah just shook her head. \"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy hoped she\u0027d eventually change her mind. It would do Hannah good, the same way it had them, but she wouldn\u0027t pressure her. When and if she attended services, it would be her own decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Harding walked out to the barn to take a look at his new filly, Funny Face, born just two weeks ago. Cal, his trainer, was working with the sire in the paddock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ranch had been Cliff\u0027s lifelong dream. He wasn\u0027t a rich man, but he\u0027d invested wisely through the years and cashed in his Internet stocks at precisely the right time. The profits had afforded him the luxury of buying property in the Olalla area and starting his own small horse ranch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff had known Cal Washburn for a number of years. He\u0027d first met him when the young man worked at Emerald Downs with Thoroughbreds. Cal, who seemed more comfortable around horses than people, was far and away the most gifted trainer he\u0027d ever known. Cliff felt fortunate to have him on a profit-sharing basis. His ability to communicate with animals was uncanny; if Cliff believed in psychic phenomena, which he didn\u0027t, he\u0027d almost think Cal could speak to horses in their own language. Unfortunately those communication skills didn\u0027t extend to people. Cal wasn\u0027t a particularly shy man, but his stutter had been a detriment in relationships, especially with women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S-some.. .l-l-lady ph-ph—called for you.\" Cal said when he saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than explain, Cal reached inside his pocket for a slip of paper and passed it to him. Cliff didn\u0027t recognize the name and for half a second, he experienced a sense of disappointment. A part of him had wanted, had hoped, the call would be from Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings had ended between them several months ago, but he hadn\u0027t been able to stop thinking about her. At one time, their relationship had held great promise. After his divorce, he\u0027d rarely dated. He\u0027d spent twenty years married to Susan and for the last ten, the only reason he\u0027d stayed in the marriage had been his daughter, Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan had been unfaithful, not once, but more times than Cliff could count. It was a sickness with her. Cliff had left the marriage with his self-confidence in tatters, and it was years before he\u0027d had any interest in seeking out another relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d met Grace, she\u0027d immediately had a strong effect on him, one of attraction, of liking and respect. Her husband had disappeared and for financial reasons, she\u0027d filed for divorce. He admired the way she\u0027d dealt with the situation. Once Dan Sherman\u0027s body was found, he watched her mourn her dead husband, and he grew to love her as she slowly emerged from her grief and pain. He\u0027d looked forward to the day he would ask her to marry him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-19.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
