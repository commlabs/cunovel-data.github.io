{"id":40406,"no":27,"title":"WORK","content":"The Smokies all had lunch together, just like at an uglydorm.\n\u003cbr\u003e The long tables had clearly been cut from the hearts oftrees. They showed knots and whorls, and wavy tracks ofgrain ran down their entire length. They were rough andbeautiful, but Tally couldn’t get over the thought that thetrees had been taken alive.\n\u003cbr\u003e She was glad when Shay and David took her outside tothe cooking fire, where a group of younger uglies hung out.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was a relief to get away from the felled trees, and from thedisturbing older uglies. Out here, at least, any of theSmokies could pass as a senior. Tally didn’t have muchexperience in judging an ugly’s age, but she turned out tobe more or less right. Two had just arrived from anothercity, and weren’t even sixteen yet. The other three—Croy,Ryde, and Astrix—were friends of Shay’s, from the groupthat had run away together back before Tally and Shay hadfirst met.\n\u003cbr\u003e Here in the Smoke only five months, Shay’s friendsalready had a hint of David’s self-assurance. Somehow, theycarried the authority of middle pretties without the firmjaw, the subtly lined eyes, or the elegant clothing. Theyspent lunch talking about projects they were up to. A canalto bring a branch of the creek closer to the Smoke; new patternsfor the sheep wool their sweaters were made from; anew latrine. (Tally wondered what a “latrine” was.) Theyseemed so serious, as if their lives were a really complicatedtrick that had to be planned and replanned every day.\n\u003cbr\u003e The food was serious too, and was piled on their platesin serious quantities. It was heavier than Tally was used to,the tastes too rich, like whenever her food history classtried to cook their own meals. But the strawberries weresweet without sugar, and although it seemed weird to eat itplain, the Smokies’ bread had its own flavor without anythingadded. Of course, Tally would have happily devouredanything that wasn’t SpagBol.\n\u003cbr\u003e She didn’t ask what was in the stew, though. Thethought of dead trees was enough to deal with in one day.\n\u003cbr\u003e As they emptied their plates, Shay’s friends startedpumping Tally for news from the city. Dorm sports results,soap opera story lines, city politics. Had she heard of anyoneelse running away? Tally answered their questions asbest she could. No one tried to hide their homesickness.\n\u003cbr\u003e Their faces looked years younger as they remembered oldfriends and old tricks.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then Astrix asked about her journey here to the Smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e 204 Scott Westerfeld“It was pretty easy, really. Once I got the hang of Shay’sdirections.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Not that easy. Took you what, ten days?” David asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “You left the night before our birthday, right?” Shay said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Stroke of midnight,” Tally said. “Nine days . . . anda half.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Croy frowned. “It took a while for the rangers to findyou, didn’t it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess so. And they almost roasted me when they did.\n\u003cbr\u003e They were doing a huge burn that got out of control.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Really? Whoa.” Shay’s friends looked impressed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “My board almost burned. I had to save it and jump inthe river.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Is that what happened to your face?” Ryde asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally touched the peeling skin on her nose. “Well, that’skind of . . .” Sunburn, she almost said. But the others’ faceswere rapt. She’d been alone so long, Tally found herselfenjoying being the center of attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e “The flames were all around me,” she said. “My shoesmelted crossing this big patch of burning flowers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay whistled. “Incredible.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s weird. The rangers usually keep an eye out forus,” David said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I guess they missed me.” Tally decided not to gointo the fact that she’d intentionally hidden her hoverboard.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Anyway, I was in the river, and I’d never even seena helicopter—except for the day before—and this thingUGLIES 205came thundering out of the smoke, driving the fire towardme. And of course I had no idea the rangers were the goodguys. I thought they were Rusty pyromaniacs risen fromthe grave!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone laughed, and Tally felt herself enjoying thewarmth of the group’s attention. It was like telling everyoneat dorm about a really successful trick, but much better,because she really had survived a life-or-death situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e David and Shay were hanging on to every word. Tally wasglad she hadn’t activated the pendant yet. She could hardlysit here enjoying the Smokies’ admiration if she’d justbetrayed them all. She decided to wait until tonight, whenshe was alone, to do what she had to.\n\u003cbr\u003e “That must have been creepy,” David said, his voicepulling her away from uncomfortable thoughts, “beingalone in the orchids for all those days, just waiting.”\n\u003cbr\u003e She shrugged. “I thought they were kind of pretty. Ididn’t know about the whole superweed thing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e David frowned at Shay. “Didn’t you tell her anything inyour note?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay flushed. “You told me not to write anything thatwould give the Smoke away, so I put it in code, sort of.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “It sounds like your code almost got her killed,” Davidsaid, and Shay’s face fell. He turned to Tally. “Hardly anyoneever makes the trip alone. Not their first time out of the city.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I’d been out of the city before.” Tally put her arm aroundShay’s shoulder comfortingly. “I was fine. It was just a bunch206 Scott Westerfeldof pretty flowers to me, and I started with two weeks of food.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why did you steal all SpagBol?” Croy asked. “Youmust love the stuff.” The others joined in his laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally tried to smile. “I didn’t even notice when I pinchedit. Three SpagBols a day for nine days. I could hardly stomachthe stuff after day two, but you get so hungry.”\n\u003cbr\u003e They nodded. They all knew about hard traveling, andhard work, too, apparently. Tally had already noticed howmuch everyone had consumed for lunch. Maybe Shay wasn’tso likely to get the not-eating disease. She had cleaned herheaping plate.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I’m glad you made it,” David said. He reachedacross and touched the scratches on Tally’s face softly.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Looks like you had more adventures than you’re telling us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally swallowed and shrugged, hoping she looked modest.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay smiled and hugged David. “I knew you’d thinkTally was awesome.”\n\u003cbr\u003e A bell rang across the grounds, and they hurried tofinish their food.\n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s that?” she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e David grinned. “That’s back to work.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re coming with us,” Shay said. “Don’t worry, itwon’t kill you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e On the way to work, Shay explained more about the long,flat roller coasters called railroads. Some stretched acrossthe entire continent, one small part of the Rusty legacy stillUGLIES 207scarring the land. But unlike most ruins, the railroads wereactually useful, and not just for hoverboarding. They werethe main source of metal for the Smokies.\n\u003cbr\u003e David had discovered a new railroad track a year or soearlier. It didn’t run anywhere useful, so he had drawn upa plan to plunder it for metal and build more hoverpaths inand around the valley. Shay had been working on the projectsince she’d come to the Smoke ten days before.\n\u003cbr\u003e Six of them took their boards up and out the other sideof the valley, down a stream churning with white water, andalong a razor-sharp ridge filled with iron ore. From there,Tally finally understood how far up the mountain she’dcome since leaving the coast. The whole continent seemedto be spread out before them. A thin bank of clouds belowthe ridge mirrored the heavier layer overhead, but forests,grasslands, and the shimmering arcs of rivers were visiblethrough the misty veil. The sea of white orchids could stillbe glimpsed from this side of the mountain, glowing like anencroaching desert in the sun.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Everything’s so big,” Tally murmured.\n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s what you can never tell from inside,” Shay said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “How small the city is. How small they have to make everyoneto keep them trapped there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally nodded, but she imagined all those people let loosein the countryside below, cutting down trees and killingthings for food, crashing across the landscape like some risenRusty machine.\n\u003cbr\u003e 208 Scott WesterfeldStill, she wouldn’t have traded anything for thismoment, standing there and looking down at the plainsspread out below. Tally had spent the last four years staringat the skyline of New Pretty Town, thinking it was the mostbeautiful sight in the world, but she didn’t think so anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e Lower down and halfway around the mountain, anotherriver crossed David’s railroad track. The route there fromthe Smoke twisted in all directions, taking advantage ofveins of iron, rivers, and dry creek beds, but they’d neverhad to leave their boards. Walking wouldn’t be an option,Shay explained, when they came back loaded with heavymetal.\n\u003cbr\u003e The track was overgrown with vines and stunted trees,every wooden cross-tie in the grip of a dozen tentacles ofvegetation. The forest had been hacked away in patchessurrounding a few missing segments of rail, but it held therest firmly in its grasp.\n\u003cbr\u003e “How are we going to get any of this out?” Tally asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e She kicked at a gnarled root, feeling puny against thestrength of the wild.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Watch this,” Shay said. She pulled a tool from herbackpack, an arm-length pole that telescoped out almost toTally’s height. Shay twisted one end, and four short strutsunfolded from the other like the ribs of an umbrella. “It’scalled a powerjack, and it can move just about anything.”\n\u003cbr\u003e UGLIES 209Shay twisted the handle again, and the ribs retracted.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then she thrust one end of the jack under a cross-tie.\n\u003cbr\u003e With another twist of her wrist, the pole began to shudder,and a groaning sound came from the wood. Shay’sfeet slipped backward, but she leaned her weight into thepole, keeping it wedged under the cross-tie. Slowly, theancient wood began to rise, tearing free from plants andearth, bending the rail that lay across it. Tally saw thestruts of the powerjack unfolding underneath the tie,gradually forcing it up, the rail above beginning to pullfree of its moorings.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay grinned up at her. “I told you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let me try,” Tally said, holding out her hand, eyeswide.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay laughed and pulled another powerjack from herbackpack. “Take that tie there, while I keep this one up.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The powerjack was heavier than it looked, but its controlswere simple. Tally pulled it open and jammed it underthe tie that Shay had indicated. She turned the handleslowly, until the jack started to shudder in her hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e The wood began to shift, the stresses of metal andearth twisting in her hands. Vines tore from the ground,and Tally could feel their complaints through the soles ofher shoes, like a distant earthquake rumbling. A metalshriek filled the air as the rail began to bend, pulling freeof vegetation and the rusty spikes that had held it down forcenturies. Finally, the jack had opened to its full extent, the210 Scott Westerfeldrail still only half-free from its ancient bonds. She and Shaystruggled to pull their jacks out.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Having fun?” Shay asked, wiping sweat from her brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally nodded, grinning. “Don’t just stand there, let’s finishthe job.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1847/53559.html","bookId":974,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM"}
