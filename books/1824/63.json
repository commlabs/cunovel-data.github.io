Brett swung around, his palm still outstretched to shake a hand, but the second he saw Allison, his smile disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you\u0027re trying to sell my work,\" Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam stood a few feet behind her. He knew she must be seething inside, yet her voice was very calm. He was impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Allison,\" Brett said, his phony smile back in place as he tried to hide the fact that he had been taken off guard. \"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m perfectly fine,\" she answered in as pleasant a tone as she could muster. \"I\u0027ve just heard about the program you\u0027ve designed, and it sounds very much like mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett immediately glanced around at his small group of admirers before striking a pose that made him look both bewildered and offended at the same time. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Allison. I\u0027ve been working on this for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny,\" Allison said, \"I don\u0027t remember ever seeing you work on a security program-or even hearing you mention one, for that matter-when I was helping you with your classwork. I, on the other hand, have spent countless hours perfecting my program. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s odd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam watched as Brett\u0027s body language changed. His hands were now fisted at his sides and his legs were braced apart for a fight. What did he suppose Allison was going to do? Karate-chop him? Liam\u0027s instincts told him to step forward and protect her, but Allison was so calm and seemingly unfazed by the threat that he held back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t prove anything,\" Brett snarled. \"You may think you\u0027re the only one who knows anything about computers or software, but you\u0027re wrong. I\u0027ve put my blood, sweat, and tears into this program, and it\u0027s finally going to pay off. You\u0027ll be wanting to congratulate me pretty soon, unless your pride gets in your way. I\u0027ll be in negotiations soon to sell my program,\" he said, stressing the word my, \"to several different companies bidding for it. They\u0027re coming here for my presentation.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted his arm and sounded very sincere when she said, \"Well, then, I wish you good luck and hope you get exactly what you deserve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked away she heard his final smug remark. \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he stole your program and is passing it off as his own?\" Liam asked her when they were alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" she responded. \"I know what Brett can do, and it would have been impossible for him to have written a program in the time he\u0027s been gone. He saw me working on mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a better person than I am. If someone stole my work, I\u0027d want to coldcock him. You don\u0027t seem too bent out of shape over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always build a safeguard into my design.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Brett has my work, he won\u0027t be able to sell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what was going on behind her mysterious smile, but he could tell she was no longer upset. In fact, she seemed almost amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison and Liam left the reception early and headed for the Four Seasons. The temperature had dropped considerably, but fortunately Liam\u0027s car was parked in the circle drive. She grabbed her coat from the backseat and put it on while Liam reached into the glove compartment to get the envelope. They were soon on their way with the heater blasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison suddenly realized how comfortable she was with him now. When she had opened the door for him tonight, her nerves went crazy and her hands actually shook. Her mind raced with questions. Was he going to say anything about last night? Or was he going to pretend having hot, sweaty, mind-blowing sex with her hadn\u0027t happened? Maybe it hadn\u0027t been like that for him. She decided to let all of that go and just enjoy the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam was quiet as they pulled into traffic. He was picturing the look in Keaton\u0027s eyes. Finally he said what was on his mind. \"You know what? Keaton\u0027s a piece of . . .\" He stopped before he said the crude word he was thinking of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A piece of work?\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Sure. That\u0027s what I was going to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took all of five minutes to reach the Four Seasons Hotel. The lobby wasn\u0027t as grand in scale as the Hamilton\u0027s, but it was just as elegant with its gleaming black marble floors divided into huge squares by creamy marble bands. The furnishings, small groupings of upholstered chairs at the perimeter, were understated, yet they fit perfectly into the refined atmosphere of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince they were early, Allison and Liam went into the bar to wait. The wood-paneled room was softly lit, and candles in tall glass cylinders on each table added to the warm ambience. Most of the tables were occupied. Liam led her to one at the back of the room and pulled out the plush leather club chair for her before he took his seat. Within seconds a waiter appeared. Allison ordered a Diet Coke, and when Liam asked for a club soda with lime, she was surprised. She had a beer on a rare occasion, but nothing else because she\u0027d seen over and over again how it impaired judgment. She wouldn\u0027t have known what to order anyway. The last time she had gone to dinner with Charlotte and Oliver, the waiter handed her a wine menu, and after staring at it for five minutes or so, she told Charlotte it might as well have been written in gibberish. She didn\u0027t know what wine went with what food, and she didn\u0027t really care. Liam, however, was a man of the world. He obviously had no objection to worldly pleasures. She finally concluded that he wasn\u0027t drinking alcohol because he was on duty . . . or was he? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-63.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
