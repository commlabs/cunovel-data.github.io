Fredda Leving paced back and forth down the length of her lab, Jomaine slouched down in a chair at her desk, Gubber perched disconsolate on a stool at one of the worktables. No information, no word, no clue. Yes, finding Caliban was an absolute imperative. But it was also absolutely impossible. The city was awash in rumors and allegedly factual news reports, but none of them were of the slightest use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Alvar Kresh and Tonya Welton seemed to have vanished off the face of the planet. Fredda had tried repeatedly to reach both of them, to no avail. Where were they? Out searching for Caliban in that blasted storm, or holed up somewhere? Were they working together, or just both out of reach at the same moment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonya Welton. Fredda looked again at Gubber and shook her head in amazement.That piece of news had utterly astonished her. It was slightly galling to realize she had been close to the last person on the planet to know about it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, in all fairness, she couldn\u0027t blame Gubber for that. If she had known about this at the time, she would have been furious, seething, massively distrustful of Gubber. Now, as this sleepless, storming night thundered into a lightless dawn, the question of who slept with whom paled into utter insignificance. Well, perhaps that was overstating the case. The heavens might tumble, but that would not stop people being fascinated by news of a torrid affair. And, speaking for herself, at least, shestill couldn\u0027t see it, but never mind that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were other concerns and questions to deal with just at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban. To other people, he no doubt meant different things, but to Fredda, he represented something very simple: the first of his kind. And, possibly, the last. If he was regarded as a failure, or as a danger, if he was seen as thecause of so much chaos and upheaval, rather than as the victim of it, then no one would ever dare build another free robot. All of their kind, for the rest of time, would be nothing more than slaves, their minds blinkered and stunted by the Three Laws. At best, some small fraction of them could exist under the somewhat looser constraints of the New Laws, but even those were chains around the mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban. Where the hell was he? He could be anywhere by now, in the city, under it, outside it. Of course, if Caliban had any sense, he would hole up in the bowels of the city and stay there. Wait for the storm to blowout to sea. These weather patterns never lasted more than a few hours. He could stay underground for years, if need be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for his power pack, of course. What had she been thinking of, giving him a low-capacity lab-operations power pack? If she had given him a standard unit, he could have hidden out for years, decades, and never have to go to anyone for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut shehad given him a lab-ops power pack. She had not and would not tell anyone else, but Caliban \u0027 s rate of power use had tested out a bit higher than expected. Assuming average levels of exertion, Fredda figured that, as of right now, he did not have much more than a few hours of power left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE howling winds at last began to fade, the rains began to fade away, if not end altogether. The crumpled remains of the antique aircar had been scattered across half the hillside by the crash, and across the other half by the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban came up slowly from behind the outcrop of rock that had afforded him some degree of shelter from the worst of the weather. He stumbled once, twice, as he came down the still-muddy slope. His binocular vision was gone, his left eye smashed and broken, dangling uselessly from its socket. Something in the interior of his right arm had been bent in the crash somehow, and he could move that arm only with difficulty, and to the accompaniment of an alarming scraping sound. His carapace, once a spotless, gleaming red, was covered with mottled splotches of mud. His chest had a number of dents and dings in it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of that mattered. He hadsurvived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrhad he survived? Was he still walking around, but just as surely doomed as if he had died already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis on-board diagnostics system was sending any number of warnings, not just about storm damage to his person, but about his basic power supply. Unless he did something about it very soon, his power would run out and he would drop in his tracks. He would survive the power failure, and could be revived if he were powered back up, but in the meantime he would be inert, helpless, easy prey for the Sheriff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban felt almost overwhelmed by frustration. Nothing had gone right. His attempt to escape from the city was a complete failure. He had accomplished exactly nothing, except to injure himself and to strand himself in a barren landscape that he knew nothing about. He had no internal maps of this place. Worse, he had seen the two aircars following him the night before. He knew perfectly well that his pursuers would soon be back on his trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he could not even concentrate on eluding them. He had to find a power source and recharge, or else die in the desert. Which way to go? He turned and looked toward the rain-shrouded spires of Hades, near the southern horizon. He could not go back to the city, that much was certain. They would be at the ready for that. But that wasall that was certain. He had absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of the lands outside the city. But the very fact that there were exits from the city, and exits pointed north, suggested that there had at least once been places to go north of Hades, over the hills. There had to besomething left behind up there. A place with a few power converters still operating. Something. Anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had no choice but to try and find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and started walking, stiffly, awkwardly, up the rocky hillside, through the spattering rain and over the rise of broken ground to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"THE storm has broken, sir. The weather forecast for the next three days is most favorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvar Kresh carne out of his half -sleeping stupor and blinked in confusion. He was sitting in an overstuffed chair in his living room. Tonya Welton, dressed in coveralls Donald had scrounged up from somewhere, was snoring gently on the couch. Her robot, Ariel, stood silent and motionless in the robot niche nearest her mistress. Strange to see a Settler with a robot in constant attendance. Kresh had been born and raised with robots always present, but surely it was sometimes unnerving for Welton. Ever-present robots must have taken some getting used to for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, more power to her, then. It had been a white night for him. No doubt he had dozed off here and there for a few minutes, but he couldn\u0027t remember much of anything except staring at the wall over the couch where Welton slept. Staring at the wall andthinking. There had been too little time for that in the days past, and maybe the storm was a blessing in disguise if it forced him away from precipitate action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was value, great value, in thinking over these clues, that evidence, trying out the ideas from this direction and that. But there was never time for that. Strange. The whole idea of Spacer society was to use robots in order to give people enough time tothink. And yet, even so, no one ever seemed to have the time for thinking, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald was offering him a cup of coffee. Kresh took the cup from him. He took a slow and careful sip. Yes, yes, he thought again as the caffeine took hold. There was great value in looking things over one last time in the dead of night, in those hours before the dawn when it all seemed to have stopped for good. One\u0027s own exhaustion could be a spur to new ideas, the vague churning border between dream and thought sometimes yielding up insights that neither wakefulness nor sleep could produce by itself. Those dream thoughts could be most conducive to new and better theories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he could feel the answer coming close. Damned close. It was there, in the back of his mind, struggling to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just now he had no more time for any answers that were not right in front of him. Now came the time for action. Personal action. He was going to go in and finish this himself. \"Donald, order all divisions back to normal operations. Cancel all ops related to Caliban-ah, except city perimeter control.\" No sense taking chances on him sneaking back into the city. \"Madame Welton and I will conduct the final phase of the search personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another big swallow of coffee, nearly burning his tongue. He set down the cup, stood up, and crossed to Tonya. He took her by the shoulder and gave her a shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wake up,\" he said. \"We\u0027re going hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE. Caliban could see it, down in the valley, perhaps two kilometers away. A small cluster of buildings, somewhat run-down in appearance, gleaming in the sunlight that emerged from behind the swift-scattering remains of the storm. He had no way of telling if there was power to be had there, or how he might get it, but those questions would rapidly become academic if he did not act soon. His only hope was that the owner would not know who he was. There was at least some chance of that, in a place this remote. If he appeared to be nothing more than a normal robot in difficulty, then perhaps he could talk his way into getting a recharge. He had no other real choices. The climb over the brow of the hill had badly taxed his reserves of power. There were no other structures in view, anywhere in any direction. Those buildings represented his last hope. He began the hike down the hillside, picking his way carefully over the scrub and loose rock. It was not a difficult climb. But if things went as wrong as they seemed likely to do, then it would be the last effort he ever made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was determined, therefore, to do the thing properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eABELL Harcourt looked out the window over his workbench and saw a most unusual sight. A robot, a damaged robot, staggering out of the hills to the south. Well, if that wasn\u0027t the limit. The whole idea of getting out of town was to avoid robots. Abell had found long ago that he couldn\u0027t get anything worthwhile carved with a houseful of perfect servants hovering about him. Robots and the damn fool society of alleged fellow sculptors who didn\u0027t know which end of a mallet to hold. Sculptors who \"directed\" the work of robot artisans churning out soulless, interchangeable works. Damned robots. A man could get addicted to them, worse than any drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was different, obviously. This fellow hadn\u0027t come over the mountains and gotten his eye smashed out of its socket just to tidy up Abell\u0027s workbench and misplace everything. Abell set down his tools and went outside. He walked about a hundred meters or so and then stood and waited for the robot to come to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt was a short, wiry, peppery sort of man, dark-skinned and completely bald. And he was a man who did not much care for interruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said, as soon as the robot was within earshot. \"Now that you\u0027ve gotten me away from my sculpture, what the devil do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would humbly ask your help, sir. My aircar crashed in the hills during the storm. I am seriously short of power, and my systems will fail if I do not receive a charge soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I keep atomic power packs lying around or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. I was not built with an atomic power source. I have a rechargeable cell, and it is near depletion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarcourt stared fiercely at the robot. This was all mighty odd. Mighty odd. Who the hell would build a robot with a power source that would tap out every few days? And what the hell was a robot doing flying an aircar in a storm like that? \"I take it there weren\u0027t no people in that aircar of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir, I was alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmph.\" Harcourt stared suspiciously at the robot for a long moment. \"Well, I suppose giving you a charge-up won\u0027t do any harm. Nothing I can do about your eye, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are most kind, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can use the charge unit in the shed. Come on.\" Abell Harcourt turned his back on the strange robot and led the way. But then it came to him. Wait a second. Red robot, flying alone, no humans-suddenly his heart was pounding in his chest. This was the killer robot, the mad rogue that had been splashed all over every news outlet when he had scrolled through the channels the night before. Caliborn, or something like that. No, Caliban, that was it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban the killer, the news called him. Abell Harcourt felt the space between his shoulder blades become itchy all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a second. A killer robot? It didn\u0027t make sense. Besides, this Caliban seemed polite for a killer.H e could have clubbed my head off a dozen times by now if that\u0027s what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt prided himself on thinking for himself, and something about this did not make sense. The news reports had been full of all sorts of wild stories and rumors, but none of them said much about the rogue robot beingpolite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt led the robot into the toolshed, a small building Harcourt used to hold his old carvings, his gardening tools, and all sorts of other random bits and pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your charge socket?\" he asked as he switched on the light, feeling calmer than he should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, sir.\" A door popped open on the left side of the robot\u0027s body, about where his ribs would have been if he were human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmmph. All right, come over here and sit-sit down here.\" Abell overturned a box. \"Here. I think if you sit on that, we can get the charge cord to reach you without any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarcourt found his hands were trembling as he dug through the accumulated junk. Not allthat calm. Was he that much afraid? He didn\u0027tfeel afraid. Damnation. This was nonsense. He thought for a moment of running back to the house, digging out his old hunting blaster, and burning a hole through this strange robot. No. That was what those damned sheep back in Hades would do. Abell Harcourt had spent his whole life determined not to think the way everyone else wanted him to think. He was not about to cave in now. The charger unit was bolted to the floor somewhere around here. There! He shoved a couple of failed nudes in wood to one side. \"Here we are,\" he said, trying to keep a casual tone to his voice as he fumbled with the charger cord. His hands were still shaking a bit as he handed the cord to the robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big robot examined the plug at the end of the cord and plugged it into his charge socket. \"Many thanks, sir. My power situation was reaching critical proportions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will it take you to absorb a full charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It should take just under an hour, if you will permit me the use of that much power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, of course,\" Harcourt said, his mind whirling, his heart pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your kindness, sir. I have not met with much of it in my experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You \u0027re Caliban, aren\u0027t you?\" Harcourt blurted out, instantly regretting it. It was madness to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot looked up at him, his one working eye staring hard at him while the other dangled, dark and useless, from its socket. \"Yes, sir. I was afraid that you would know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027mthe one who should be afraid of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir? I have no reason to hurt you. You have helped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the news they say you\u0027ve attacked all sorts of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" Caliban said. \"It would be fairer to say all sorts of people have attackedme. I left the city in hopes of being left alone. Nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban looked at him carefully, cocking his head to one side in a thoughtful sort of way. \"Youare afraid of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some. Maybe not as much as I should be. But hell, I\u0027m an old man, and the worst you could do is kill me. Been alive too long, anyway,\" Harcourt admitted. \" And yet you are assisting me. All you needed to do was refuse me the chance to charge up, and I would have toppled over in a few minutes. I do not understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt shrugged. \"You seemed too courteous to be a killer, I suppose. And I kinda like the idea of causing trouble for all those politicians in the city. But seems to me you \u0027re the one with troubles. What are you going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know. My knowledge of the world is limited in many ways. I wish to escape, to survive. Perhaps you could advise me on ways to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt found an old bucket and turned it upside down, being very careful to keep Caliban in view, doing nothing that might seem threatening or dangerous. He was willing to take a chance on this robot being as sane as he seemed to be, but there was no sense pushing his luck. \"I\u0027m not sure I can,\" he admitted. \"Let me think a second.\" Who the hell would be willing to help Caliban, with the whole world determined to hunt him down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wait a moment. The whole world hunting one lone outcast. Fredda Leving had talked of something much like this precise situation. He had looked it up afterwards, read it for himself. The Frankenstein myth, or myths, rather. A very complex set of contradictory versions of the same compelling tale. This misunderstood monster, thrust into a world of which he had no knowledge, feared and hated for the crime of being different. The fear-crazed, half-savage villagers storming the castle and killing him for no better reason than blind fear, with no better evidence against him than rumor and their own prejudices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that ancient tale about to be played out again? Had the ideal human society of the Spacers advanced not one nanometer since those days of myth and fear? No. Not if he could help it. \"I do not think you can escape on your own,\" Harcourt said carefully. \"If you crashed an aircar, the Sheriff will find it soon enough. Were they in pursuit of you when you crashed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then rest assured they will find you soon, whether or not you stay here. They will find the car, perhaps find whatever trail you left in coming here, perhaps coming directly here because it is the closest habitation. If you walk out of here, they will find you on the open valley. If you took my aircar, I am sure they are watching these skies with every type of sensor they have. And even if you did elude them in the air or on the ground, your power will give out again in another few days. They merely have to watch the places you could go for a charge, and capture you when you turn up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what can I do?\" Caliban asked. \"Where can I turn? I am determined to live. I will not accept death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt laughed, a short, sad bark. \"Few of us do, my friend. Few of us do. Let me think for a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was silent. Abell Harcourt had often found himself at odds with Infernal society. But this. This was different. Helping a robot without the Laws to survive was surely a crime, and rightly so. Caliban was dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs dangerous as a human being. Hadn\u0027t he attacked his creator, Fredda Leving?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say you have never attacked anyone?\" Abell asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I defended myself without causing deliberate harm when a group of Settlers tried to kill me. Beyond that, I have no knowledge of attacking anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noknowledge? That implies that you could have attacked someone without knowing about it. How could that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My first memory is of standing over an unconscious woman I later learned was Fredda Leving. It seems possible, though unlikely, that I committed the attack, was somehow deactivated, and then was switched back on with my memory blanked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds a bit thin to me. And if it did happen that way, and your memory was wiped utterly clean afterwards, I could introduce you to a whole herd of rather dull philosophers who would argue that the present you is a different being than the one who committed the attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. I had come to that conclusion myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had you indeed?\" Rare indeed were robot philosophers. Harcourt thought of Fredda Leving and her Frankenstein myth again. Maybe when Caliban had been secret, she might have wanted to destroy Caliban to protect herself-but with his existence generally known, it was in her best interest to demonstrate that Caliban wasnot a crazed killer. If Caliban was innocent of the charges against him, then surely her guilt was reduced as well. She had every motive for helping Caliban. Maybe she could protect him in ways that Abell Harcourt could not...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr else he was making too damn many assumptions about Fredda Leving\u0027s nobility, and she would simply turn Caliban in to save her skin. But what other option was there but to turn to her? Time was running out. Sooner or later, almost certainly sooner, the Sheriff would be allover this valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an idea,\" Abell Harcourt said. \"One that involves a great deal of risk. However, I see no other way out for you at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"High risk is better than certain doom,\" Caliban said, a strange tone in his voice. He sounded almost tired. But robots never got tired until they were out of power, and here Caliban was charging up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless it was hisspirit that was tired. That, too, would be a remarkable thing in a robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbell Harcourt stood up, his fear forgotten, his mind made up. If this was a mad robot, then the world was in need of more madness. Fredda Leving. Call her, ask her help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY were airborne three minutes after Abell Harcourt \u0027 s call came through. Fredda\u0027 s first instinct was to charge at top speed straight for the coordinates Abell had given her. But Kresh was no fool, and that meant that he was having Fredda watched. Fredda had no intention of leading Kresh straight to Caliban. She swung her aircar to the west, flying at a sedate pace in the local traffic pattern. She glanced behind herself and saw Gubber and Jomaine in the rear passenger seats, their faces grim and set...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas one of them the guilty one? Was one of the two men behind her the one who had tried to kill her and botched the job?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry not to think about it. Westward. Fly west to the outskirts of the city, north at low altitude until she crossed the mountains-andthen barrel in straight for Harcourt\u0027s place at maximum speed. Get there before Kresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then pray that he would at least look at her waiver before burning a hole in Caliban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRASH sites never looked the way Kresh expected them to, and he had seen enough of them to know better. He always imagined finding a neat little impact inside a tidy little crater, the aircar perhaps crumpled a bit. He imagined the pilot-usually a drunk stupid enough to fly himself home but smart enough to elude any and all robotic protection-as being slumped over the control, dead butneatly dead, no wounds, readily identifiable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the reality was always horribly different. Today, for example. He knew it the moment Donald spotted the crash site and they did a flyover pass. It had looked bad even from the air. Here on the ground, reality was harsher still. There were bits and pieces of aircar allover the hillside, strewn in all directions, shattered into a thousand burned, bent pieces. If a human had been flying the aircar, there wouldn\u0027t even be anything recognizably human left, let alone any part intact and unburned enough to ID an individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut arobot had been flying this one, and robots didn\u0027t burn. There had to besomething of him left. Tonya, Donald, and Ariel were fanned out across the hillside, doing a second search, having found no trace of him on the first. Kresh was starting to wonder if Caliban had survived this by some miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheriff Kresh!\" Tonya was calling, from the east side of the crash. \"Footprints! I found footprints!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKresh hurried toward her, eager to see what she had found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was almost to her when he stopped dead in his tracks, cursing in disappointment. \"Yes, footprints,\" he said. \"But not Caliban.\" From where he was standing, he could see what Tonya could not. The line of prints led in a neat line straight toward their source-Ariel, busily searching another patch of ground. Ariel looked up, took in the situation, and called to them. \"Forgive me, Lady Welton. I did not mean to cause any confusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damnation!\" Kresh growled. \"Nothing in this case leads in the right direction!Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it clicked. Wait a minute. Just half a damned minute!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there never was half a minute. \"Sheriff!\" Another call, from Donald this time. Good. He would trust Donald\u0027s search skills far above Tonya\u0027s. He trotted back up the hill to the north of the crash, Tonya and Ariel right behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this time there was no mistake. An area of sandy dirt overlay the bare rock for a long stretch of the ground. And on it was a whole line of prints, leading up the grade in a direction none of them had gone yet. Kresh could see broken twigs and bits of rock that had been kicked aside, leading clear up the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo question at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came a sound overhead. They all looked up and saw it. An aircar flying low and fast from the west, arcing down to come in for a landing in the valley below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Kresh said. \"I\u0027ll bet whatever you want that is Fredda Leving, trying to get to him first. Come on. We\u0027ve got to get therefast before she can get him out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them turned and hurried back to the aircar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd halfway to the car, Alvar Kresh stopped dead and stood there for that half a minute he had wished for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all it took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had figured it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eABELL Harcourt heard the sound of aircraft coming in and went to the door of the shed. He looked into the sky. Two of them. A civilian job, and one of those sky-blue Sheriff\u0027s Department aircars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to Caliban. \"Better unplug yourself from that charger,\" he said. \"Company\u0027s coming. A little too much of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban pulled the charger plug from the socket in his side and stood up. He went to the door and looked skyward with his one good eye. Was it imagination, or did the robot\u0027s shoulders slump with disappointment just a touch when he spotted the Sheriff\u0027s car and realized what it meant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either she squealed to Kresh, or Kresh managed to follow her in. Shall we go receive them all in the parlor, like civilized folks?\" Harcourt asked, his voice full of bitterness. \"Or should we make a run for it in my aircar?Maybe we could get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, friend Abell. There is no place left to run,\" Caliban said. \"Outside. We shall meet them outside, well away from your house. If they mean to kill me, I see no reason for your home to be shot up as well. Let us go meet them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHERIFF Kresh worked the aircar control without knowing he did. He was aware of nothing else but what he could see, down on the ground. There he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaliban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Alvar Kresh set eyes upon the robot he had been tracking. Standing on the ground next to an odd-looking man, both of them calmly watching the arrival of their visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had him. He had him. And in a moment, he would win it all, win against an opponent he had not even been aware of until a few minutes before. It was so obvious, once he shook off all his assumptions and looked, reallylooked, at the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched as Fredda Leving\u0027s aircar swung around, set down first, but Kresh\u0027s aircar landed within seconds of hers. That suited Kresh fine. Let them all get ahead. He would catch up soon enough. Heknew. Now nothing remained-except to prove it. But it would be wise to be careful. This was not a moment to get too eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the aircar gently down on the valley floor, undid his seat restraints, and turned to regard Tonya and Ariel in the backseat. Ariel betrayed no emotion, of course, but Tonya Welton, Queen of the Settlers, was obviously on the edge of hysteria. \" All right,\" Kresh said. \" Ariel, Donald, Madame Welton-I\u0027m going to need all of you to be careful here. The situation is still dangerous. If someone makes a mistake, and someone gets hurt-well, that would not be good. I want everyone alive at the end of this, if for no other reason than so we\u0027ll be able to get the whole story. I don\u0027t want any loose ends. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Tonya Welton said, her face pale, her expression stem and unreadable. Kresh knew she could crack at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Kresh said. \"Then let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonya nodded rather jerkily and opened the hatch. She stepped out the door, Ariel following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut neither Kresh nor Donald made any effort to follow the other two out. Interesting that Donald knew Kresh wanted him to stay put. But then, Donald had been a little bit ahead every step of the way, ever since he had gotten to the crime scene before everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Donald,\" Kresh said, \"you mentioned something about a theory you wanted to test. I believe I understand now what you meant. You know, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald did not speak, but instead stared straight ahead and watched the tableau taking shape on the ground outside. Kresh followed his gaze. The man who lived here stood next to Caliban. Terach and Leving stood on Caliban \u0027 s other side, getting a good hard look at their creation. Tonya Welton, her face strained and nervous, stood next to Leving, Ariel behind her. Gubber Anshaw was at Welton\u0027s side, holding her hand, clearly proud and relieved that \u0027he could now express his affection in public. They were forming up to stand in a rough, nervous half -circle facing the aircar, waiting for Kresh. But still Donald said nothing. And Alvar Kresh found that his heart was pounding so hard it seemed about to pop out of his chest. Donald could sense that, of course, with his lie-detection system. What would he make of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Donald, I asked you a question,\" Kresh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still Donald kept his silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKresh sighed. As always, it was a question of juggling the Law potentials. Weaken the First Law injunction to do no harm, strengthen the Second Law requirement to obey orders. \"Donald, first noting that my ego will be quite unharmed no matter what your answer, I noworder you to answer my question. You figured it out some time ago, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. I was not altogether certain of my conclusions until last night, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In future, Donald, I would suggest that holding back on your theories and opinions could do more harm to me and my career than speaking up and bruising my ego. But we will discuss this later. Just now, I think it is time to test your little theory. Might I suggest that you contrive to get Fredda Leving between yourself and Ariel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was about to offer the same arrangement, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Follow my cue. Let\u0027s get to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKresh opened his door and stepped down out of the car as Donald got out the other side. Kresh noted, somewhat absently, that the palms of his hands were slick with sweat. Careful. Careful. He wiped his hands on his pants legs. They were nearly all the way there, but he would only have one chance. He had to get it right, and he had to bear in mind that she was still damn-all dangerous. Things could still go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped around the side of the car and strode slowly toward the semicircle. Good, Donald had positioned himself just behind Leving, with Ariel on his other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvar Kresh moved slowly, carefully, straight toward her. Time seemed to slow, events seemed to expand. Everything seemed to look larger, mort; important, with all details razor-sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFredda Leving lifted her hand, moved it toward a pocket on her tunic, began to pull something out. Kresh\u0027s fingers twitched, but he forced himself to keep his hands at his sides. Not yet. Slowly. Carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeving pulled a piece of paper from her pocket and held it up. \"Sheriff Kresh, I have a waiver. It permits me to own one No Law robot. It establishes Caliban as a legal chattel and causes his existence to conform with all-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd time suddenly speeded up. Heart pounding, fear-sweat pouring out of him, Alvar Kresh pulled out his blaster, his body acting almost before his mind willed it to act. A misstep, a wrong guess, and she could be on him, kill him before his heart could beat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow. Now. Now. Alvar Kresh leveled his blaster and aimed it straight for Fredda Leving, s heart. \"Dr.Fredda Leving, I arrest you as a Settler spy and saboteur,\" he said, his voice firm and strong, betraying none of his fear. \"You faked the attack on yourself, programmed Caliban to wreak havoc on our planet, and then set him loose in the city. It was all part of a Settler plot to throw Inferno society into chaos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFredda Leving\u0027s jaw dropped in astonishment. She stepped forward to protest. The other humans in the semicircle, no less amazed, stepped back. She was isolated, with a robot behind her on either side, Ariel just a bit closer than Donald. Perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not move, Dr. Leving! Not one muscle, or I will be obliged to fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFredda Leving, the terror plain on her face, lowered the paper just a trifle. It was nothing, the merest involuntary movement, but it was all the excuse Alvar Kresh needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFredda Leving screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brilliant roar of light leapt out from the blaster and struck her square in the chest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/caliban-isaac-asimov-s-caliban-1/page-20.html","bookId":1728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:55 AM"}
