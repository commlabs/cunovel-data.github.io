{"id":12860,"no":12,"title":"XII CARTONER VERSUS FATE","content":"\u0026nbsp;It has been said that on the turf, and under it, all men are equal. It is, moreover, whispered that the crooked policy of Russia forwards the cause of horseracing at Warsaw by every means within its power, on the theory that even warring nationalities may find themselves reconciled by a common sport. And this dream of peace, pursued by the successor of that Czar who said to Poland: “Gentlemen—no dreams,” seems in part justified by the undeniable fact that Russians and Poles find themselves brought nearer together on the race-course than in any other social function in Warsaw. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come,” cried Paul Deulin, breaking in on the solitude of Cartoner\u0027s rooms after lunch one day towards the end of October. “Come, and let us bury the hatchet, and smoke the cigarette of peace before the grand-stand at the Mokotow. Everybody will be there. All Poland and his wife, all the authorities and their wives, and these ladies will peep sideways at each other, and turn up their noses at each other\u0027s toilets. To such has descended the great strife in eastern Europe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You think so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I think so, or I pretend to think so, which comes to the same thing, and makes it a more amusing world for those who have no stake in it. Come with me, and I will show you this little world of Warsaw, where the Russians walk on one side and the Poles pass by on the other; where these fine Russian officers glance longingly across the way, only too ready to take their hearts there and lose them—but the Czar forbids it. And, let me tell you, there is nothing more dangerous in the world than a pair of Polish eyes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He broke off suddenly; for Cartoner was looking at him with a speculative glance, and turned away to the window.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come,” he said. “It is a fine day—St. Martin\u0027s summer. It is Sunday, but no matter. All you Englishmen think that there is no recording angel on the Continent. You leave him behind at Dover.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I have no principles,” said Cartoner, rising from his chair, and looking round absent-mindedly for his hat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You would be no friend of mine if you had. There is no moderation in principles. If a man has any at all, he always has some to spare for his neighbors. And who wants to act up to another man\u0027s principles? By-the-way, are you doing any good here, Cartoner?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “None.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nor I,” pursued Deulin; “and I am bored. That is why I want you to come to the races with me. Besides, it would be more marked to stay away than to go—especially for an Englishman and a Frenchman, who lead the world in racing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is why I am going,” said Cartoner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you don\u0027t like racing?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I am very fond of it,” answered the Englishman, in the same absent voice, as he led the way towards the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the Jasna they found a drosky, where there is always one to be found at the corner of the square, and they did not speak during the drive up the broad Marszalkowska to the rather barren suburb of the Mokotow (where bricks and mortar are still engaged in emphasizing the nakedness of the land), for the simple reason that speech is impossible while driving through the streets of the worst-paved city in Europe. Which is a grudge that the traveller may bear against Russia, for if Poland had been a kingdom she would assuredly have paved the streets of her capital.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The race-course is not more than fifteen minutes\u0027 drive from the heart of the town, and all Warsaw was going thither this sunny afternoon. At the entrance a crowd was slowly working its way through the turnstiles, and Deulin and Cartoner passed in with it. They had the trick, so rare among travellers, of doing this in any country without attracting undue attention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a motley enough throng. There were Polish ladies and gentlemen in the garb of their caste, which is to-day the same all the world over, though in some parts of Ruthenia and Lithuania one may still come across a Polish gentleman of the old school in his frogged coat and top-boots. German tradesmen and their families formed here and there one of those domesticated and homely groups which the Fatherland sends out into the world\u0027s trading centres. And moving amid these, as quietly and unobtrusively as possible, the Russian officers, who virtually had the management of the course—tall, fair, clean men, with sunburned faces and white skins—energetic, refined, and strong. They were mostly in white tunics with gold shoulder-straps, blue breeches, and much gold lace. Here and there a Cossack officer moved with long, free strides in his dressing-gown of a coat, heavily ornamented with silver, carrying high his astrakhan cap, and looking round him with dark eyes that had a gleam of something wild and untamed in them. It was a meeting-ground of many races, one of the market-places where men may greet each other who come from different hemispheres and yet owe allegiance to one flag: are sons of the empire which to-day gathers within one ring-fence the north, the south, the east, and the west.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “France amuses me, England commands my respect, but Russia takes my breath away,” said Deulin, elbowing his way through the medley of many races. On all sides one heard different languages—German, the sing-song Russian—the odd, exclamatory tongue which three emperors cannot kill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And Germany?” inquired Cartoner, in his low, curt voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Bores me, my friend.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was pushing his way gently through into the paddock, where a number of men were congregated, but no ladies.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The Fatherland,” he added, “the heavy Fatherland! I killed a German once, when I was in the army of the Loire—a most painful business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was still shaking his head over this reminiscence when they reached the gateway of the paddock. He was passing through it when, without turning towards him, he grasped Cartoner\u0027s arm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look!” he said, “look!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a sudden commotion in the well-dressed crowd in the paddock, and above the gray coats and glossy hats the tossing colors of a jockey. The head of a startled horse and two gleaming shoes appeared above the heads of men for a moment. A horse had broken away with its jockey only half in the saddle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The throng divided, and dispersed in either direction like sheep before a dog—all except one man, who, walking with two sticks, could not move above a snail\u0027s pace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, because they were both quick men, with the instincts and a long practice of action in moments calling for a rapid decision, Deulin and Cartoner ran forward. But they could not save the catastrophe which they knew was imminent. The horse advanced with long, wild strides, and knocked the crippled old man over as if he were a ninepin. He came on at a gallop now, the jockey leaning forward and trying to catch a broken bridle, his two stirrups flying, his cap off. The little man was swearing in English. And he had need to, for through the paddock gate the crowd was densely packed and he was charging into it on a maddened horse beyond control.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deulin was nearer, and therefore the first to get to the horse; but Cartoner\u0027s greater weight came an instant later, and the horse\u0027s head was down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let go! let go!” cried the jockey through his teeth, as Cartoner and Deulin, one on each side, crammed the stirrups over his feet. “Let go! I\u0027ll teach him!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they obeyed him, for the horse interested them less than the Prince Bukaty, lying half-stunned on the turf. They were both at his side in a moment and saw him open his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am unhurt,” he said. “Help me up. No! sh—h! No, nothing is broken; it is that confounded gout. No, I cannot rise yet! Leave me for a minute. Go, one of you, and tell Wanda that I am unhurt. She is in box No. 18, in the grand-stand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He spoke in French, to Deulin more particularly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Go and tell her,” said the Frenchman, over his shoulder, in English. “Some busy fool has probably started off by this time to tell her that her father is killed. You will find us in the club-house when you come back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Cartoner went to the grand-stand to seek Wanda there, in the face of all Warsaw, with his promise to avoid her still fresh in his memory. As he approached he saw her in the second tier of boxes. She was dressed in black and white, as she nearly always was. It was only the Russians and the Germans who wore gay colors. He could see the surprise on her face and in Martin\u0027s eyes as he approached, and knew that there were a hundred eyes watching him, a hundred ears waiting to catch his words when he spoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Princess,” he said, “the prince has had a slight accident, and has sent me to tell you that he is unhurt, in case you should hear any report to the contrary. He was unable to avoid a fractious horse, and was knocked down. Mr. Deulin is with him, and they have gone to the club pavilion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He spoke rather slowly in French, so that all within ear-shot could understand and repeat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shall we go to him?” asked Wanda, rising.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Only to satisfy yourself. I assure you he is unhurt, princess, and would come himself were he able to walk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wanda rose, and turned to take her cloak from the back of her chair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you take us to him, monsieur?” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the three quitted the grand-stand together in a rather formal silence. The next race was about to start, and the lawn, with its forlorn, autumnal flower-beds, was less crowded now as they walked along it towards the paddock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It was very good of you to come and tell us,” said Martin, in English, “with the whole populace looking on. It will do you no good, you know, to do a kindness to people under a cloud. I suppose it was true what you said about the prince being unhurt?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Almost,” answered Cartoner. “He is rather badly shaken. I think you will find it necessary to go home, but there is no need for anxiety.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh no!” exclaimed Martin. “He is a tough old fellow. You cannot come in here, you know, Wanda. It is against the Jockey Club laws, even in case of accidents.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood at the gate of the club enclosure as he spoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wait here,” he said, “with Cartoner, and I will be back in a few minutes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Cartoner and Wanda were left in the now deserted paddock, while the distant roar of voices announced that the start for the next race had been successfully accomplished.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wanda looked rather anxiously towards the little square pavilion into which her brother was hurrying, and Cartoner only looked at Wanda. He waited till she should speak, and she did not appear to have anything to say at that moment. Perhaps in this one case that clear understanding of which she was such a pronounced advocate was only to be compassed by silence, and not by speech. The roar of voices behind them came nearer and nearer as the horses approached the winning-post. The members of the club stood rigid beneath the pavilion awning, some with field-glasses, others with knitted brows and glittering eyes. All eyes were turned in one direction, except Wanda\u0027s and Cartoner\u0027s.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, when the race was over and the roar had subsided, Martin came hurrying back, and one glance at his face told them that there was no need for anxiety.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is laughing in there over a glass of cognac. He refuses absolutely to go home, and he wants me to help him up the stairs. He will sit under the awning, he says. And we are to go back to the grand-stand,” Martin said, as he approached.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “See,” he added, pointing to the paddock where the crowd was hurrying to gather round the winning horse. “See, it is already a thing of the past. And he wants it to be so. He wants no fuss made about it. It is no good advertising the fact of the existence of a dog with a bad name, eh? Thank you all the same, Cartoner, for your good offices. You and Deulin, they say, averted a catastrophe. The incident is over, my dear Wanda. It is forgotten by all except us. Wait here a minute and I will come back to you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a nod to Cartoner, as if to say, “I leave her to your care,” he turned and left them again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then at length Wanda spoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You see,” she said, “you are not so strong as—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As what?” he asked, seeing that she sought a word.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As Fate, I suppose,” she answered, and her eyes were grave as she looked across the mournful level land towards the west, where the sun was sinking below parallel bars of cloud to the straight line of the horizon. Sunset over a plain is one of nature\u0027s tragic moments.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it Fate?” she asked, with a sudden change of manner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Even Fate can be hampered in its movements, princess,” answered Cartoner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By what?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By action. I have written for my recall.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was looking towards the pavilion. It seemed that it was he, and not his companion, who was now anxious for Martin to return. Wanda was still looking across the course towards the sinking sun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You have asked to be recalled from Warsaw?” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then,” she said, after a pause, “it would have been better for you if we had not met at Lady Orlay\u0027s, in London. Monsieur Deulin once said that you had never had a check in your career. This is the first check. And it has come through—knowing us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cartoner made no answer, but stood watching the door of the pavilion with patient, thoughtful eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You cannot deny it,” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he did not deny it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then she turned her head, and looked at him with clever, speculative keenness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why have you asked for your recall?” she asked, slowly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And still Cartoner made no answer. He was without rival in the art of leaving things unsaid. Then Martin came to them, laughing and talking. And across the course, amid the tag-rag and bobtail of Warsaw, the eyes of the man called Kosmaroff watched their every movement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2877/79620.html","bookId":1161,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:02:11 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:02:11 AM"}
