{"id":59013,"no":457,"title":"Chapter 457","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"text-decoration: underline\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDespicable\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a pity…” Leylin sighed. If he was willing to use up all of his magic crystals, and sell a few more precious materials on top of that, he would stand a chance in bidding for the Wing of the Sun. Even though that was good, it did not quite fit his requirements as his main intentions were still to obtain the astral stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if Duke Gilbert was here, he would be willing to offer a sky-high price for the Wing of the Sun, even if was only going to be useful for research!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA higher-ranked bloodline as well as a top-notch meditation technique! These were temptations that a Warlock would easily succumb to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon getting hold of this precious object, they must have exhausted all possible methods until it was no longer possible to exploit the bloodline of the Sun’s Child, before reluctantly putting it up for auction. If not, they would never have minded transforming into a Warlock family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as Leylin was aware, there wasn’t a single Warlock Family on the central continent that could reach rank 6. In other words, if one was really able to combine the blood of the Sun’s Child together with the meditation technique, a Breaking Dawn bloodline Warlock would be able to gradually rise to power in the central continent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A loss in such a bloodline is totally impossible to recreate in the present central continent!” Leylin remembered that he had received data on fusion and modification of bloodlines from Quicksand Castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I were to make use of the modification technique, together with the genetic reformation function of my A.I. Chip, there might just be a possibility of success….” However, even if it succeeded, this would only produce yet another ancient bloodline treasure for Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already had a pure ancient red dragon bloodline on hand. However, it was a pity that after a long period of research, he had realised that he was still unable to transform his own bloodline. All the research on synthesising and modifying bloodlines had gone down the drain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Warlock’s bloodline did not only exist within his body, it was also merged with his spirit. Even Leylin was at a loss for how to deal with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, it is only when one has advanced to the Morning Star realm, and when their spiritual force has undergone continuous advancements, then can they come into contact with the spirit itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, even if Leylin was able to restore the bloodline of the Sun’s Child, he would not have the desire to bid for this treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a matter of fact, his interest in Wing of the Sun far exceeded his interest in the Sun’s Child bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an advanced ancient meditation technique!” It was indeed a higher level bloodline meditation technique as compared to Kemoyin’s Pupil. Even though they were both bloodline meditation techniques, the Wing of the Sun was evidently at a much higher level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemoyin’s Pupil only had a total of four levels due to the origin of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent Bloodline. The Giant Kemoyin Serpent was originally a rank 4 creature, limiting the progress of a Warlock who would partake in this technique. Since no Kemoyin Warlock could cross rank 4, there was no method to attain a higher-ranked meditation technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the Sun’s Child was different. It was originally a Rank 6 creature, hence allowing a Warlock of its bloodline to reach rank 6 as well, thus engendering the highest level of meditation techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCustomarily, in the central continent, a meditation technique with four levels that could let its practitioner attain the Morning Star realm, to be called a high-grade meditation technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, an advanced meditation technique of at least level 6 was needed for a Magus to peek at the path to the Breaking Dawn realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, Leylin would not be contented with just a mere rank 4 Kemoyin’s Pupil. His ultimate goal was to reach Breaking Dawn and higher levels to reach immortality! Hence, the Wing of the Sun was attractive. At least it could serve as a model upon which the Kemoyin’s Pupil could be improved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet… Would it really be worth it to pay such a high price for a meditation technique that would merely work as a reference?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin shook his head, attempting to erase the thought from his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Meditation techniques are not tangible, but only information made up of words and pictures. Since the Azure Mountain clan is certain that the meditation technique is complete, they’re bound to have a copy of the information as well as the bloodline of the Sun’s Child. Perhaps I can start working from that area…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin placed his hand on his chin as his thoughts wandered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter moments of silence, the Magi below finally responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two hundred and ten million magic crystals!” An aged voice called out from the VIP lounge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if it was a signal, the crowd immediately quoted their prices, practically flooding the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was after all an advanced meditation technique coupled with an ancient bloodline, thus it was priceless. Even though there was not much use for it, the value of this precious object for collection purposes had way exceeded its base price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the vastness and mystery of spells were not something that current Magi could explore completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps, in one of the hidden corners of the central continent, there lay a powerful technique that was capable of activating the Sun’s Child bloodline. If that was the case, by buying this precious object at a low price today, one could earn a fortune in the future!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was clearly what the majority of the Magi here thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis definitely included those Morning Star Magi who were rich and imposing, willing to buy this just for their own research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the Azure Mountain auction house was unlikely to attract Magi of such levels, there were bound to be some exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne such exception was within a VIP lounge that was distinctly larger than the room that Leylin was in. The Magus inside had an emaciated face and silver eyes. He was wearing the Devil’s Cry robe and smiled, “I didn’t expect to come across such a precious object!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t use the device to quote his price and instead said softly, “One billion magic stones!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, even though his voice was soft, his comment was heard by the Magi in the entire auction venue, leading to a halt in the quoting of prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, one that could quote such a high price was obviously a Morning Star Magus. Who else would dare to compete with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, when Leylin heard this voice, his entire body suddenly stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Demon Hunter Cyril!’ Even though the tone of the voice was different, Cyril had left a deep impression in Leylin’s mind. His voice was recorded in his A.I. Chip and hence he recognised the other party immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can’t believe that even he is here.’ After calming himself, Leylin placed his hand on his chin and smiled bitterly, ‘In order to get such cheap auction prices, you can even scare the Magi in this venue. Demon Hunter Cyril, you are still as braven as before.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, he did not intend to stand out to make a complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin understood that he should keep a low profile when he was at a disadvantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Morning Star Magi was indeed a great deterrent. Once Cyril quoted his price, the entire auction house became silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“.... Okay! Since no one is increasing the price, I’ll announce that this top-notch meditation technique will belong to the Lord in the first VIP lounge!” The host laughed dryly, as he started to mediate the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, his heart ached. According to him, this precious object should not only be worth one billion magic crystals but instead, it should at least worth more than two billion magic crystals. It was definitely possible to sell it at such a high price judging from the attendance of high level Magi in this venue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow? Even the Oakheart Clan was willing to offer more than one billion magic crystals for this meditation technique. This was definitely a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dear lord, your loot is here, please follow me to make the transaction. Also, the guardian of our clan would like to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, in the first lounge, Serene bowed respectfully and even her voice became a little shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I will go.” Cyril waved his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a Morning Star Magi was required to follow the rules. His rash behaviour would only lead to the Morning Star Magi of the Oakheart Clan warning him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn actual fact, he only had this one chance to do such a thing. If he dared to do it again, the Azure Mountain King would definitely become hostile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was clear that deep in his heart he did not feel remorseful at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was reputation worth to him? Tangible benefits were the most important. Once he complied and guaranteed that he would not do such a thing again, he could easily obtain such top-notch meditation technique. So why not do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemon Hunter Cyril was originally more crafty and despicable than demons. This was also the exact reason why other Magi feared him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of Cyril’s actions, the day’s auction ended on a bad note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding on that the attendance of Demon Hunter Cyril spread like wildfire, if the Azure Mountain auction house did not guarantee that such a thing would not happen again, they would even incur more losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, who dared to compete with a Morning Star Magus? If such a thing happened in each auction then the Azure Mountain auction house should just sell the items off to them instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of the guarantee of the Azure Mountain Clan, the second day of auction went on as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin, too, came to the venue and watched emotionlessly as each precious object was bought by others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day before, Serene had hinted at the appearance of the astral stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the exact reason why Leylin merely watched in silence throughout the entire auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the end of the auction, the host then announced, “This is today’s most precious item: astral stone!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Leylin was able to see his ultimate goal at this auction on stage—the astral stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe existence of the astral stone was widely known in the Magus World, but not many had laid eyes on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiny black stone that resembled any other was brought on stage. Upon close inspection, the surface of the stone reflected soft rays of blue light, as if it was starlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The astral stone is a necessity for interplanar experiments! This stone weighs 1582 grams and its density is very high. This is known to be the highest quality stone within this century. It has an abundance of energy and is definitely the best choice for astral gate experiments!” The host rambled on about the astral stone non-stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the astral stone was indeed worth less than the top-notch meditation technique from the day before, the application of this stone was widely known, hence the popular demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-456\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-458\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-457","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
