{"id":115,"no":1,"title":"The Story Behind the Foundation","content":"On August 1, 1941, when I was a lad of twenty-one, I\n\u003cbr\u003e was a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia University and had been\n\u003cbr\u003e writing science fiction professionally for three years. I was hastening\n\u003cbr\u003e to see John Campbell, editor of Astounding , to whom I had sold\n\u003cbr\u003e five stories by then. I was anxious to tell him a new idea I had for a\n\u003cbr\u003e science fiction story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was to write a historical novel of the future; to tell the story of\n\u003cbr\u003e the fall of the Galactic Empire. My enthusiasm must have been catching,\n\u003cbr\u003e for Campbell grew as excited as I was. He didn\u0027t want me to write a\n\u003cbr\u003e single story. He wanted a series of stories, in which the full history\n\u003cbr\u003e of the thousand years of turmoil between the fall of the First Galactic\n\u003cbr\u003e Empire and the rise of the Second Galactic Empire was to be outlined. It\n\u003cbr\u003e would all be illuminated by the science of \"psychohistory\" that Campbell\n\u003cbr\u003e and I thrashed out between us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first story appeared in the May 1942 Astounding and the second\n\u003cbr\u003e story appeared in the June 1942 issue. They were at once popular and\n\u003cbr\u003e Campbell saw to it that I wrote six more stories before the end of the\n\u003cbr\u003e decade. The stories grew longer, too. The first one was only twelve\n\u003cbr\u003e thousand words long. Two of the last three stories were fifty thousand\n\u003cbr\u003e words apiece.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By the time the decade was over, I had grown tired of the series,\n\u003cbr\u003e dropped it, and went on to other things. By then, however, various\n\u003cbr\u003e publishing houses were beginning to put out hardcover science fiction\n\u003cbr\u003e books. One such house was a small semiprofessional firm, Gnome Press. They\n\u003cbr\u003e published my Foundation series in three volumes: Foundation (1951); Foundation and Empire (1952); and Second Foundation (1953). The three books together came to be known as The Foundation\n\u003cbr\u003e Trilogy .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The books did not do very well, for Gnome Press did not have the\n\u003cbr\u003e capital with which to advertise and promote them. I got neither statements\n\u003cbr\u003e nor royalties from them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In early 1961, my then-editor at Doubleday, Timothy Seldes, told\n\u003cbr\u003e me he had received a request from a foreign publisher to reprint the\n\u003cbr\u003e Foundation books. Since they were not Doubleday books, he passed the\n\u003cbr\u003e request on to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I shrugged my shoulders. \"Not interested, Tim. I don\u0027t get royalties\n\u003cbr\u003e on those books.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seldes was horrified, and instantly set about getting the rights\n\u003cbr\u003e to the books from Gnome Press (which was, by that time, moribund) and\n\u003cbr\u003e in August of that year, the books (along with I, Robot ) became\n\u003cbr\u003e Doubleday property.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From that moment on, the Foundation series took off and began to earn\n\u003cbr\u003e increasing royalties. Doubleday published the Trilogy in a single\n\u003cbr\u003e volume and distributed them through the Science Fiction Book Club. Because\n\u003cbr\u003e of that the Foundation series became enormously well-known.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention, held in Cleveland, the\n\u003cbr\u003e fans were asked to vote on a category of \"The Best All-Time Series.\" It\n\u003cbr\u003e was the first time (and, so far, the last) the category had been included\n\u003cbr\u003e in the nominations for the Hugo Award. The Foundation Trilogy won the award, which further added to the popularity of the series.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Increasingly, fans kept asking me to continue the series. I was polite\n\u003cbr\u003e but I kept refusing. Still, it fascinated me that people who had not\n\u003cbr\u003e yet been born when the series was begun had managed to become caught up\n\u003cbr\u003e in it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Doubleday, however, took the demands far more seriously than I\n\u003cbr\u003e did. They had humored me for twenty years but as the demands kept\n\u003cbr\u003e growing in intensity and number, they finally lost patience. In 1981,\n\u003cbr\u003e they told me that I simply had to write another Foundation novel and,\n\u003cbr\u003e in order to sugar-coat the demand, offered me a contract at ten times\n\u003cbr\u003e my usual advance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nervously, I agreed. It had been thirty-two years since I had written\n\u003cbr\u003e a Foundation story and now I was instructed to write one 140,000 words\n\u003cbr\u003e long, twice that of any of the earlier volumes and nearly three times\n\u003cbr\u003e as long as any previous individual story. I re-read The Foundation\n\u003cbr\u003e Trilogy and, taking a deep breath, dived into the task.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fourth book of the series, Foundation\u0027s Edge , was published\n\u003cbr\u003e in October 1982, and then a very strange thing happened.
