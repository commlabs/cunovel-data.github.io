He was excited, therefore, for the rare chance of talking to one of the underlings on the grounds, to smile and to doff the trappings of Imperial rule for a few minutes. It made him feet democratic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was this gardener whom Seldon had spoken of, for instance. It would be fitting, even a pleasure, to reward him belatedly for his loyalty and bravery-and to do so himself, rather than leaving it to some functionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe therefore arranged to meet the fellow in the spacious rose garden, which was in full bloom. That would be appropriate, Cleon thought, but, of course, they would have to bring the gardener there first. It was unthinkable for the Emperor to be made to wait. It is one thing to be democratic, quite another to be inconvenienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gardener was waiting for him among the roses, his eyes wide, his lips trembling. It occurred to Cleon that it was possible that no one had told the man the exact reason for the meeting. Well, he would reassure him in kindly fashion-except that, now he came to think of it, he could not remember the fellow\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to one of the officials at his side and said, \"What is the gardener\u0027s name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sire, it is Mandell Gruber. He has been a gardener here for thirty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor nodded and said, \"Ah, Gruber. How glad I am to meet a worthy and hardworking gardener.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sire,\" mumbled Gruber, his teeth chattering. \"I am not a man of many talents, but it is always my best I try to do on behalf of your gracious self.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, of course,\" said the Emperor, wondering if the gardener suspected him of sarcasm. These men of the lower class lacked the finer feelings that came with refinement and manners, which always made any attempt at democratic display difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleon said, \"I have heard from my First Minister of the loyalty with which you once came to his aid and of your skill in taking care of the grounds. The First Minister tells me that he and you are quite friendly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sire, the First Minister is most gracious to me, but I know my place. I never speak to him unless he speaks first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite, Gruber. That shows good manners on your part, but the First Minister, like myself, is a man of democratic impulses and I trust his judgment of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruber bowed low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor said, \"As you know, Gruber, Chief Gardener Malcomber is quite old and longs to retire. The responsibilities are becoming greater than even he can bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sire, the Chief Gardener is much respected by all the gardeners. May he be spared for many years so that we can all come to him for the benefit of his wisdom and judgment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well said, Gruber,\" said the Emperor carelessly, \"but you very well know that that is just mumbo-jumbo. He is not going to be spared, at least not with the strength and wit necessary for the position. He himself requests retirement within the year and I have granted him that. It remains to find a replacement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Sire, there are fifty men and women in this grand place who could be Chief Gardener.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dare say,\" said the Emperor, \"but my choice has fallen upon you.\" The Emperor smiled graciously. This was the moment he had been waiting for. Gruber would now, he expected, fall to his knees in an ecstasy of gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not and the Emperor frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruber said, \"Sire, it is an honor that is too great for me-entirely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" said Cleon, offended that his judgment should be called into question. \"It is about time that your virtues are recognized. You will no longer have to be exposed to weather of all kinds at all times of the year. You will have the Chief Gardener\u0027s office, a fine place, which I will have redecorated for you, and where you can bring your family. You do have a family, don\u0027t you, Gruber?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Sire. A wife and two daughters. And a son-in-law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good. You will be very comfortable and you will enjoy your new life, Gruber. You will be indoors, Gruber, and out of the weather, like a true Trantorian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sire, consider that I am an Anacreonian by upbringing-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have considered, Gruber. All worlds are alike to the Emperor. It is done. The new job is what you deserved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head and stalked off. Cleon was satisfied with this latest show of his benevolence. Of course, he could have used a little more gratitude from the fellow, a little more appreciation, but at least the task was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was much easier to have this done than to settle the matter of the failing infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleon had, in a moment of testiness, declared that whenever a breakdown could be attributed to human error, the human being in question should forthwith be executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a few executions,\" he said, \"and it will be remarkable how careful everyone will become.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid, Sire,\" Seldon had said, \"that this type of despotic behavior would not accomplish what you wish. It would probably force the workers to go on strike-and if you try to force them back to work, there would then be an insurrection-and if you try to replace them with soldiers, you will find they do not know how to control the machinery, so that breakdowns will begin to take place much more frequently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no wonder that Cleon turned to the matter of appointing a Chief Gardener with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Gruber, he gazed after the departing Emperor with the chill of sheer horror. He was going to be taken from the freedom of the open air and condemned to the constriction of four walls. Yet how could one refuse the Emperor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych looked in the mirror of his Wye hotel room somberly (it was a pretty run-down hotel room, but Raych was not supposed to have too many credits). He did not like what he saw. His mustache was gone; his sideburns were shortened; his hair was clipped at the sides and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked-plucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse than that. As a result of the change in his facial contours, he looked baby-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was disgusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor was he making any headway. Seldon had given him the security reports on Kaspal Kaspalov\u0027s death, which he had studied. There wasn\u0027t much there. Just that Kaspalov had been murdered and that the local security officers had come up with nothing of importance in connection with that murder. It seemed quite clear that the security officers attached little or no importance to it, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not surprising. In the last century, the crime rate had risen markedly in most worlds, certainly in the grandly complex world of Trantor, and nowhere were the local security officers up to the job of doing anything useful about it. In fact, the security establishment had declined in numbers and efficiency everywhere and (while this was hard to prove) had become more corrupt. It was inevitable this should be so, with pay refusing to keep pace with the cost of living. One must pay civil officials to keep them honest. Failing that, they would surely make up for their inadequate salaries in other ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon had been preaching this doctrine for some years now, but it did no good. There was no way to increase wages without increasing taxes and the populace would not sit still for increased taxes. It seemed they would rather lose ten times the credits in graft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all part (Seldon had said) of the general deterioration of Imperial society over the previous two centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, what was Raych to do? He was here at the hotel where Kaspalov had lived during the days immediately before his murder. Somewhere in the hotel there might be someone who had something to do with that-or who knew someone who had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to Raych that he must make himself conspicuous. He must show an interest in Kaspalov\u0027s death and then someone would get interested in him and pick him up. It was dangerous, but if he could make himself sound harmless enough, they might not attack him immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych looked at his timeband. There would be people enjoying their predinner aperitifs in the bar. He might as well join them and see what would happen-if anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some respects, Wye could be quite puritanical. (This was true of all the sectors, though the rigidity of one sector might be completely different from the rigidity of another.) Here, the drinks were not alcoholic but were synthetically designed to stimulate in other ways. Raych did not like the taste, finding himself utterly unused to it, but it meant that he could sip his drink slowly and look around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught the eye of a young woman several tables away and had difficulty in looking away. She was attractive and it was clear that Wye\u0027s ways were not puritanical in every fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few moments, the young woman smiled slightly and rose. She drifted toward Raych\u0027s table, while Raych watched her speculatively. He could scarcely (he thought with marked regret) afford a side adventure just now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped for a moment when she reached Raych and then let herself slide smoothly into an adjacent chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t look like a regular here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych smiled. \"I\u0027m not. Do you know all the regulars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just about,\" she said, unembarrassed. \"My name is Manella. What\u0027s yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych was more regretful than ever. She was quite tall, taller than he himself was without his heels-something he always found attractive-had a milky complexion, and long, softly wavy hair that had distinct glints of dark red in it. Her clothing was not too garish and she might, if she had tried a little harder, have passed as a respectable woman of the not-too-hardworking class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych said, \"My name doesn\u0027t matter. I don\u0027t have many credits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Too bad.\" Manella made a face. \"Can\u0027t you get a few?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to. I need a job. Do you know of any?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych shrugged. \"I don\u0027t have any experience in anything fancy, but I ain\u0027t proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManella looked at him thoughtfully. \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Mr. Nameless. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t take any credits at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych froze at once. He had been successful enough with women, but with his mustache-his mustache. What could she see in his baby face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Tell you what. I had a friend living here a couple of weeks ago and I can\u0027t find him. Since you know all the regulars, maybe you know him. His name is Kaspalov.\" He raised his voice slightly. \"Kaspal Kaspalov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManella stared at him blankly and shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know anybody by that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad. He was a Joranumite and so am I.\" Again, a blank look. \"Do you know what a Joranumite is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"N-no. I\u0027ve heard the word, but I don\u0027t know what it means. Is it some kind of job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych felt disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"It would take too long to explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like a dismissal and, after a moment of uncertainty, Manella rose and drifted away. She did not smile and Raych was a little surprised that she had remained as long as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Well, Seldon had always insisted that Raych had the capacity to inspire affection-but surely not in a businesswoman of this sort. For them, payment was the thing.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes followed Manella automatically as she stopped at another table, where a man was seated by himself. He was of early middle age, with butter-yellow hair, slicked back. He was very smooth-shaven, but it seemed to Raych that he could have used a beard, his chin being too prominent and a bit asymmetric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Manella had no better luck with this beardless one. A few words were exchanged and she moved on. Too bad, but surely it was impossible for her to fail often. She was unquestionably desirable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych found himself thinking, quite involuntarily, of what the upshot would be if he, after all, could-And then Raych realized that he had been joined by someone else. It was a man this time. It was, in fact, the man to whom Manella had just spoken. He was astonished that his own preoccupation had allowed him to be thus approached and, in effect, caught by surprise. He couldn\u0027t very well afford this sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked at him with a glint of curiosity in his eyes. \"You were just talking to a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych could not help smiling broadly. \"She\u0027s a friendly person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she is. And a good friend of mine. I couldn\u0027t help overhearing what you said to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t nothing wrong, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all, but you called yourself a Joranumite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych\u0027s heart jumped. His remark to Manella had hit dead-center after all. It had meant nothing to her, but it seemed to mean something to her \"friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid that mean he was on the road now? Or merely in trouble?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych did his best to size up his new companion, without allowing his own face to lose its smooth naivete. The man had sharp greenish eyes and his right hand clenched almost threateningly into a fist as it rested on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych looked owlishly at the other and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the man said, \"I understand you call yourself a Joranumite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych did his best to look uneasy. It was not difficult. He said, \"Why do you ask, mister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t think you\u0027re old enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m old enough. I used to watch Jo-Jo Joranum\u0027s speeches on holovision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you quote them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych shrugged. \"No, but I got the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a brave young man to talk openly about being a Joranumite. Some people don\u0027t like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m told there are lots of Joranumites in Wye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be. Is that why you came here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for a job. Maybe another Joranumite would help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are Joranumites in Dahl, too. Where are you from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no question that he recognized Raych\u0027s accent. That could not be disguised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I was born in Millimaru, but I lived mostly in Dahl when I was growing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing much. Going to school some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why are you a Joranumite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych let himself heat up a bit. He couldn\u0027t have lived in downtrodden, discriminated-against Dahl without having obvious reasons for being a Joranumite. He said, \"Because I think there should be more representative government in the Empire, more participation by the people, and more equality among the sectors and the worlds. Doesn\u0027t anyone with brains and a heart think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you want to see the Emperorship abolished?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych paused. One could get away with a great deal in the way of subversive statements, but anything overtly anti-Emperor was stepping outside the bounds. He said, \"I ain\u0027t saying that. I believe in the Emperor, but ruling a whole Empire is too much for one man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t one man. There\u0027s a whole Imperial bureaucracy. What do you think of Hari Seldon, the First Minister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think nothing about him. Don\u0027t know about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you know is that people should be more represented in the affairs of government. Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych allowed himself to look confused. \"That\u0027s what Jo-Jo Joranum used to say. I don\u0027t know what you call it. I heard someone once call it \u0027democracy,\u0027 but I don\u0027t know what that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Democracy is something that some worlds have tried. Some still do. I don\u0027t know that those worlds are run better than other worlds. So you\u0027re a democrat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you call it?\" Raych let his head sink, as if in deep thought. \"I feel more at home as a Joranumite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, as a Dahlite-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just lived there awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-you\u0027re all for people\u0027s equalities and such things. The Dahlites, being an oppressed group, would naturally think in that fashion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear that Wye is pretty strong in Joranumite thinking. They\u0027re not oppressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different reason. The old Wye Mayors always wanted to be Emperors. Did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighteen years ago,\" said the man, \"Mayor Rashelle nearly carried through a coup in that direction. So the Wyans are rebels, not so much Joranumite as anti-Cleon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych said, \"I don\u0027t know nothing about that. I ain\u0027t against the Emperor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are for popular representation, aren\u0027t you? Do you think that some sort of elected assembly could run the Galactic Empire without bogging down in politics and partisan bickering? Without paralysis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych said, \"Huh? I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think a great many people could come to some decision quickly in times of emergency? Or would they just sit around and argue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but it doesn\u0027t seem right that just a few people should have all the say over all the worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you willing to fight for your beliefs? Or do you just like to talk about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one asked me to do any fighting,\" said Raych.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose someone did. How important do you think your beliefs about democracy-or Joranumite philosophy-are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d fight for them-if I thought it would do any good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a brave lad. So you came to Wye to fight for your beliefs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Raych uncomfortably, \"I can\u0027t say I did. I came to look for a job, sir. It ain\u0027t easy to find no jobs these days-and I ain\u0027t got no credits. A guy\u0027s gotta live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question shot out without warning, but Raych was ready for it. \"Planchet, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First or last name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only name, as far as I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no credits and, I gather, very little education.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no experience at any specialized job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ain\u0027t worked much, but I\u0027m willing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027ll tell you what, Planchet.\" He took a small white triangle out of his pocket and pressed it in such a way as to produce a printed message on it. Then he rubbed his thumb across it, freezing it. \"I\u0027ll tell you where to go. You take this with you and it may get you a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych took the card and glanced at it. The signals seemed to fluoresce, but Raych could not read them. He looked at the other man warily. \"What if they think I stole it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t be stolen. It has my sign on it and now it has your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they ask me who you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t. You say you want a job. There\u0027s your chance. I don\u0027t guarantee it, but there\u0027s your chance.\" He gave him another card. \"This is where to go.\" Raych could read this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man made little dismissing gestures with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych rose and left-and wondered what he was getting into. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forward-the-foundation-foundation-7/page-11.html","bookId":2019,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:50 PM"}
