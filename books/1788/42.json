{"id":78227,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\u003cp\u003eA laughing mock argument sprang up between Amelia and the baker as she flatly refused one for herself, saying she had no wish to marry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of course you do!\" the baker declared with a sly grin \"It\u0027s what every woman hopes for.\" Amelia smiled and passed the gingerbread men to her sisters. \"How much for three, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A farthing each.\" He attempted to hand her a fourth. “And this is for no charge. It would be a sad waste for a lovely blue-eyed lady to go without a husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I couldn\u0027t,\" Amelia protested. \"Thank you, but I don\u0027t ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice came from behind her. \"She\u0027ll take it.\" Discomfiture and pleasure seethed low in her body, and Amelia saw a dark masculine hand reaching out, dropping a silver piece into the baker\u0027s upturned palm. Hearing her sisters\u0027 giggling exclamations, Amelia turned and looked up into a pair of bright hazel eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need the luck,\" Cam Rohan said, pushing the gingerbread husband into her reluctant hands. \"Have some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obeyed, deliberately biting off the head, and he laughed. Her mouth was filled with the rich flavor of molasses and the melting chewiness of gingerbread on her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at Rohan, she thought he should have had at least one or two flaws, some irregularity of skin or structure... but his complexion was as smooth as dark honey, and the lines of his features were razor-perfect. As he bent his head toward her, the perishing sun struck brilliant spangles in the dark waves of his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaging to swallow the gingerbread, Amelia mumbled, \"I don\u0027t believe in luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan smiled. \"Or husbands, apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for myself, no. But for others?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027ll marry anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore replying, Rohan cast a look askance at the Hathaway sisters, who were smiling benevolently upon them. Merripen, on the other hand, was scowling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I steal your sister away?\" Rohan asked the rest of the Hathaways. \"I need to speak with her on some apiary matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\" Beatrix asked, taking the headless gingerbread husband from Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspect Mr. Rohan is referring to our bee room,\" Win replied with a grin, gently urging her sisters to come away with her. \"Come, let\u0027s see if we can find a stall with embroidery silks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go far,\" Amelia called after them, more than a little amazed by the speed at which her family was abandoning her. \"Bea, don\u0027t pay for something without bargaining first, and Win...\" Her voice trailed away as they scattered among the stalls without listening. Only Merripen gave her a backward glance, glowering over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeming to enjoy the sight of Merripen\u0027s annoyance, Rohan offered Amelia his arm. \"Walk with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have objected to the soft-voiced command, except this was probably the last time she would see him for a long while, if ever. And it was difficult to resist the beguiling gleam of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you say I would marry?\" she asked as they moved through the crowd at a relaxed pace. It did not escape her that many gazes strayed to the handsome Roma dressed like a gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s written on your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Palm-reading is a sham. And men don\u0027t read palms. Only women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because we don\u0027t,\" Rohan replied cheerfully, \"doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t. And anyone could see your marriage line. It\u0027s as clear as day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage line? Where is it?\" Amelia took her hand from his arm and scrutinized her own palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan drew her with him beneath the shade of a bulky beech tree on the edge of the green. Crowds milled across the cropped oval, while the last few swags of sunlight crumpled beneath the horizon. Torches and lamps were already being lit in anticipation of evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one,\" Rohan said, taking her left hand, turning it palm upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia\u0027s fingers curled as a wave of embarrassment went through her. She should have been wearing gloves, but her best pair had been stained, and her second-best pair had a hole in one of the fingers, and she hadn\u0027t yet managed to buy new ones. To make matters worse, there was a scab on the side of her thumb where she\u0027d gashed it on the edge of a metal pail, and her nails had been filed childishly short after she’d broken them. It was the hand of a housemaid, not a lady. For one wistful moment she wished she had hands like Win’s, pale, long-fingered, and elegant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan stared for a moment. As Amelia tried to pull away, he closed his hand more firmly around hers. “Wait,?she heard him murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no choice but to let her fingers relax into the warm envelope of his hand. A blush raced over her as she felt his thumb nuzzle into her palm and stroke outward until all her fingers were lax and open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis quiet voice seemed to collect at some hidden pleasure center at the base of her skull. \"Here.\" His fingertip brushed over a horizontal line at the base of her little finger. \"Only one marriage. It will be a long one. And these? He traced a trio of small vertical notches that met the marriage line. \"It means you’ll have at least three children.\" He squinted in concentration. \"Two girls and a boy. Elizabeth, Jane, and?Ignatius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t help smiling. \"Ignatius?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After his father, \" he said gravely. \"A very distinguished bee farmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spark of teasing in his eyes made her pulse jump. She took his hand and inspected the palm. \"Let me see yours.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-42.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
