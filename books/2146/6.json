Gossip traveled so fast in Dullsville it was scary. But this breaking news had found its way to Becky particularly fast. I had to wonder if Jagger was spreading it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did youhear?\" Iasked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that there\u0027s going to be a club--for us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A club? Here?\" Iacted surprised, but reallyIwas. Not that there was going to be a club--but that the word was out about it already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.And you don\u0027t have to be twenty-one to get in. It\u0027s going to be awesome!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did youhear where it\u0027s going to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but as soonas Ifind out, I\u0027ll let youknow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe irony was that Becky was telling me about the club I should have been telling her about all along. She was going to scavenge for information that I already knew. I felt guilty not telling her, but until I knew for sure about Jagger\u0027s true intentions, I didn\u0027t want to add gossip to the mill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait,\" Beckysaid. \"It will be funto have a place to hang out and dance withMatt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. Myinnocent best friend was planning oncoming to the club--the one that Jagger would be inviting unknown vampires to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go--\" I blurted out. \"I mean, I don\u0027t think it will be your type of club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s open to everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the problem, Ithought. Mortals and vampires, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I have to protect Becky from the modern vampire world forever? It appeared I would, at least for the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying,\" Ibegan, \"if the popular crowd is hanging out there, thenit\u0027s not going to be a funplace for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s supposed to be awesome. Matt and his friends will be going. I\u0027m sure it will be fine--we canhang with just us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll just keep to ourselves.And besides, clubs are dark and loud. I\u0027ve seenthem on TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear that there\u0027s going to be a place to rave?\" a Prada-bee a few lockers away said to her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard about it,\" the friend said. \"But I don\u0027t have any info.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be so cool. We don\u0027t have anywhere we candance.At least not without a fake ID.\" The Prada-bee laughed a snorty laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is it going to be?\" her friend asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard it\u0027s going to be in that abandoned church.\" The Prada-bee spoke ina whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was told they\u0027re renting out the country club on Friday nights,\" her friend gushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is `they\u0027?\" the Prada-bee asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard they\u0027re going to have it in the graveyard. Surely you\u0027d show up,\" Trevor said, spotting me eavesdropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last to know, as usual?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdidn\u0027t evenbother witha response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps another highlyanticipated event youwon\u0027t be invited to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Youhave to be invited?\" Iasked, breaking myshort silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the opening, of course,\" mynemesis said. \"Theyaren\u0027t going to let just anyone in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The yare my friends, not yours,\" I said. \"Believe me, I can make sure you don\u0027t get past the bouncer.\" I shut my locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so sure,\" he said. \"I\u0027m onthe VIP list.\" He slithered up to me so close Icould smell the peppermint gum he was chewing. \"And if there is a new hot spot club, you\u0027ll be needing a date,\" he said coyly. He took my hand and before I could withdraw it, he wrote his number on my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky passed me hand sanitizer and I did my best to rub it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the Crypt\u0027s grand opening was byinvitationonly? Jagger was killer ongetting the buzzstarted. He hadn\u0027t even started to decorate. By the time he did open, he\u0027d have the whole highschool lined up around the block waiting to get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wasn\u0027t sure that was sucha great thing after all. The students here would be exposed to unknownvampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the drinks were flowing and the heat of the dance floor kicked up, who knew which of these mortals would be hanging out with, kissing on, or being driven home by vampires from other towns? And though most of the students had contempt for me and had made my life here in Dullsville hell by either ignoring or teasing me, I couldn\u0027t let their materialistic lives be indanger.And if anyone inthis townwas going to fall preyto a handsome vampire, it was going to be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeckyand Iwere hanging out onthe soccer field\u0027s bleachers shortlyafter the sunset. Iwas doodling inmyjournal,drawing pictures of what Iwanted the club to be like and ideas for gifts forAlexander\u0027s upcoming birthday. I was set to meet him inanhour, after he\u0027d awokenand had dinner. Iwas killing time bydoodling as the soccer snobs competitively kicked the black-and-white ball up and down the field against the opposing Tigers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember whenwe were here at the game withSebastian?\" Beckyasked, referring to whenAlexander\u0027s best friend first arrived in Dullsville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took a picture. Of you and him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes . . . I remember,\" I said. Then it hit me what Beckyhad just told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the weirdest thing happened. Iwas flipping throughthe photos onmyphone and he\u0027s not there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must not have saved the picture,\" I said. \"I do that all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No--that\u0027s not what Imean. He isn\u0027t inthe picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what I was a fraid of. \"You probably moved it,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the phone and showed me. \"Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw a picture of me, smiling and angled, as if I was leaning my body against someone. Only there wasn\u0027t anyone else in the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that odd?\" she said, perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . maybe he shifted out of view.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember him doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe youmoved the camera. That happens to me all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But the wayyouare sitting--if he had moved, youwould have fallenover.And there is still this space.And if I moved--thenthere wouldn\u0027t be all this blank space where he\u0027d been. Ican\u0027t figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like they are going to score . . .\" I said, attempting to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t youadmit it\u0027s weird?\" she stressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was I going to say? You took a picture of a vampire. What do you expect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ithought youof all people would freak out. It\u0027s almost like out of a scarymovie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky shoved the picture in front of me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It is weird. But I\u0027m sure he just moved awayat the last minute. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned to doodling in my journal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" Becky said. \"But I\u0027m saving this picture. I was hoping to have a picture of Sebastian.At least I have a cool one of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was over and I saw Trevor hanging out by the trees. He was resting his arm against a trunk and was posing in a seductive way that led me to believe whomever he was talking to was of the female persuasion, and of the pretty kind. It was unlike Trevor to be secretive with his women, so I became curious. As he continued to talk and pose, the girl remained hidden in the shadows. After a few minutes I noticed something illuminated by the field lights--bright scarlet hair--the kind that came from a bottle, not used on any of the girls at our high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are yougoing?\" Beckyasked as Ileaped over the bleachers and raced downthe metal stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s who\u0027s leaking the info. Jagger must have put her up to it, Iimmediatelysurmised. If Trevor\u0027s onboard,then Jagger is sure to have a crowd. Jagger knows Trevor will tell the whole school, along with the whole town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Scarlet!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked surprised to see me, and stepped even further back into the shadows. Trevor also seemed taken aback by my presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Matt called to him as the team headed toward the gym. Trevor paused. It was odd for him to have two goth girls in his company. He was used to being surrounded by preppy, conservative types. He was reveling in his rebellious attraction to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go. . . .\" Trevor said reluctantly. I knew he wanted to staywithus, but it would have to remaina fantasy for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he lingered in front of us by the tree, it was as if he wanted to kiss one or both of us, but he wasn\u0027t brave enough to make a move on Scarlet in front of me. And he knew if he kissed me, I would slug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that Trevor\u0027s number?\" she asked, noticing the smudged digits onmypalm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and Itried to burnthem off. Itold you--he\u0027s not what youthink he is.\" Ipaused for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenwe were alone, Isaid to her, \"AfterAlexander\u0027s party, youall just left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m so sorryit ended so quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, are youintownlong? Will the others be joining you?\" Iasked withpretend innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ican\u0027t lie to you, Raven. We\u0027re all still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so relieved my friend was confiding in me about what I already knew. I would have hated for her to have turned out to be a false friend. She had accepted me as a vampire, and then when she found out my true identity,she accepted me for being a mortal. She was a better friend to me thanI\u0027d beento her.And because she and Onyxdidn\u0027t have the historywithAlexander or the cunning actions and animosityof Luna, they were the type of vampire girl friends I\u0027d longed for all mylife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was so sad whenyouguys left,\" Isaid. \"Iknew youhad to, but Iwas reallybummed. Iam relieved knowing you\u0027re still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wishwe could hang out,\" she said sincerely. \"But don\u0027t tell Jagger you saw me if you run into him. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" I said. I hated that he had a hold on her. He was providing her and her best friend withroom and board,and I\u0027m sure she didn\u0027t want to jeopardize that. But Iwanted to hang out withthem and didn\u0027t want him to get in the way of my fun. \"Why don\u0027t you and Onyx meet me tonight at the cemetery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s a great idea! We can have some girl time!\" she said, giving me a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Scarlet disappeared into the night. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-6.html","bookId":2146,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:51 PM"}
