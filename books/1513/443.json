Chip in his hands, his learning and operating abilities were far better than other common Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese in turn resulted in increased productivity, allowing him to earn sufficient resources for his practice and research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, he did not need to look for support from a large clan like other Magi did in order to obtain the required supplies, academic knowledge and so on. However, due to the many secrets he had, he had no choice but to stay alone as much as possible and conceal his secrets in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, until now, he had never once thought of finding a partner. Those times when he slept with women were only to have fun, or to satiate his needs. If Freya used the Hall’s jewel to seduce him, that would be a headache for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, he now had in his hands something that she needed urgently, and things would not get so complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, although the bloodline crystal could not eradicate the issue of the other clan’s bloodline weakening, there was still hope to delay it for a period of time. This would give Leylin some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it? Are you satisfied with the exchange?” Kesha curled her lips out of what seemed to be injustice and said, “If this is still not enough, then count the two of us in. In order to obtain the bloodline crystal, Freya is ready to put everything at stake anyway…….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s enough!” Leylin nodded, pretending that he had not heard the other part of Kesha’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The two of you, please wait a moment!” He rose and turned into another corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Leylin left, the two female Magi relaxed at once. They knew that the entire Magus Tower and especially the interior, was all under Leylin’s control. However, it felt different when he wasn’t around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women even seemed to have a faint hope that their words would reach Leylin through the tower genie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it? Are you reassured now?” Kesha fell lazily onto the soft couch, the slit in the lower part of her gown vaguely exposing her snow-white thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” Freya heaved a sigh of relief, but it seemed as if she was disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, the bloodline crystal can only relieve the deterioration of the bloodline for at most a century. When the time comes, what is to happen is inevitable. Moreover, using the bloodline crystal repeatedly will cause its effects to weaken sharply, ultimately making it completely ineffective!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if Kesha was bewitching Freya, “Hence, the safest method is still to absorb fresh blood! With the degree of pureness of Leylin’s bloodline, your clan will not have to worry about this for the next few centuries!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why aren’t you doing that?” Freya blushed slightly as she threw a question back at Kesha without backing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I want to, but it’s not like you haven’t seen it. This method doesn’t work on him. What else can I do?” Kesha sighed, took a few steps forward and raised Freya’s chin with her finger, “Such a beautiful and pure female Magus, and that guy isn’t even tempted. Is he really made of stone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”Sister Kesha isn’t lacking either……” An indistinct smile flashed across Freya’s eyes as she clasped both hands around Kesha’s waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”It seems that I’ve got to teach you a lesson this time……” Kesha grinned and gave Freya a kiss on the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“……”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin, who saw the scene through the tower genie, could not help but be a little dumbstruck. These women were indeed wild and playful, and were even completely unscrupulous in trying to tempt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Leylin could see but could not touch them. He had to control his bloodline, which made him feel slightly depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However……” Leylin smirked slyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, he did not dare to sleep with women because he was afraid that they would use techniques and spells to steal his bloodline. However, ever since he’d obtained the research data regarding the composition of bloodlines from Quicksand Castle, his knowledge of bloodlines had deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was given a little more time, he could definitely develop a technique that would not leak out his seed and keep the source of his bloodline. If it were to be combined with the A.I. Chip, even if those women coveted his bloodline, they would not have a chance of getting anything out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that time came, the expressions of those women who had suffered a loss in order to obtain the bloodline, would surely be very interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the sexy scene on the screen made a faint anger rise in Leylin. It seemed that he would have to order Kubler to buy some beautiful female slaves to extinguish the fire within him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was always unwilling to make things unfair for himself. Everything he had must be the best, regardless of the aspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, what’s the point in having eternal life if he could not enjoy the pleasures of the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he wanted to join in, Leylin still waited in a gentlemanly manner for more than ten minutes before entering the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room had already been tidied and cleaned, and the clothes on the two women were extremely neat without a speck of dust. Their expressions were very calm, as if they had done nothing but wait for him during this entire time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled as his nose twitched slightly. He noticed a very special scent in the air, which carried a slight aroma and an even more unique flavour he was familiar with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile watching his movements, Kesha and Freya could not help but blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only when Leylin saw Kesha almost jumping in anger that he laughed, putting an end to his silent provocation. He then placed a silver tray on the round table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This bloodline crystal is the last in my inventory. If I had a family, I would never have brought it out to exchange...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, the two women’s gazes were attracted to the rich, scarlet radiance that was emitted from the bloodline crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are very grateful for your generosity! Hopefully, our friendship will be able to continue on forever!” When it came to business, Freya’s face no longer had the shyness from before. What replaced it was an extremely solemn expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes!” Kesha nodded in agreement beside her, along with a hopeful gaze towards Leylin, “I heard from Mentor Gilbert that you were very dishonest that time and even hid some of the precious remains of ancient creatures. Come on, share them with us too…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leylin watched this senior of his whose eyes were almost sparkling with radiance, he could not help but shake his head and laugh wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”Leylin, Mentor told me to inform you to be more cautious these days. If there’s nothing going on, do not exit the Ouroboros Clan’s boundaries.” At the time of parting, Kesha whispered into Leylin’s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?!” Leylin was startled, but he swiftly gathered his thoughts and asked, “Is it because of Demon Hunter Cyril?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s right. He’s a Morning Star Magus after all, and just by revealing his intentions of attacking, many Magi wanting to get into his good books would do all the work on his behalf without him even lifting a finger. This is especially so for Magi of Nefas. They are rather insane…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wry smile emerged on the corner of Kesha’s lips, “It’s not just you. Robin and I were also given the same order by Mentor!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long silence, Leylin nodded with a smile. “I understand. It just so happens that I’ve been wanting to take a break for a while now. The Magus Tower has also just been built, and I have yet to begin any experiments as of yet… For the next few decades, I can’t leave this place!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s good then!” What Kesha was most afraid of was that this junior of hers, with his youthful vigour, would get himself in trouble outside. However, it seemed like Leylin was acting very rationally. She could not help but feel gratified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged Leylin before leaving with Freya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watched the silhouette of the two women disappear before his eyes, Leylin’s smile slowly faded into a dark, gloomy expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning Star Magus, Cyril……” He was already an adult before he crossed over to his world, and his experiences were far richer than any other Magus. Naturally, he would not venture out and land himself in danger due to momentary rage. That was something only a fool would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was time to withdraw, Leylin did not mind hiding in a tortoise shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for his reputation, honour and such? With his life in jeopardy, none of those mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Leylin was still unhappy about the Morning Star Magus’ pettiness and grudge-holding attitude, especially when he recalled the time when the other party attacked without considering his reputation. If he had not prepared in advance and gotten Mentor Gilbert’s reinforcements, Leylin would have died there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Great Morning Star Magus is just like a star in the sky, bright and radiant, as if everlasting…” Leylin glance in the direction of Nefas as a sneer emerged on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, even if it is a star, it’s bound to be extinguished one day, what more Demon Hunter Cyril. I look forward to the moment you fall from the sky…” In his heart, Leylin had already decided that when his skills surpassed the other party, he would definitely fulfil Cyril’s destiny of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, on the surface, Leylin had not exposed his intentions at all. After Kesha’s warning, Leylin had been keeping a low-profile and hid in his Magus Tower. He even avoided going to the headquarters as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one hand, there were a lot of experiments and tasks to work on. But a larger reason was that he actually had problems with the materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Magi who coveted what he had numbered far more than just Freya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, he was now a Vapour Phase Magus and was considered a high-level Magus in the organisation. Furthermore, after building the Magus Tower, he was comparable to a Crystal Phase Magus in his territory and could not be trifled with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, many Magi would reconsider and wonder if it was worth it to offend a promising young man like him just for material items of lesser significance than Leylin’s potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, his days went by relatively peacefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this was all possible since the fact that he had secretly ordered Tanasha to carry the resources had not been divulged. If not, there was no need to think about the effects this would have on the Magi’s relationship would Leylin. Even Morning Star Magi would get involved!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously hoped to sell those items as soon as possible to avoid others having their eye on them. After all, this bit of his harvest was only a drop in the ocean for him. However, if he sold them too easily, it would very likely attract suspicion. This was why the whole process had been delayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a year of waiting, Leylin finally had the opportunity to sell off the rest of the remains of high-energy creatures in his possession at a high price, by commissioning the Ouroboros Clan to auction it. These items were ultimately bought by Lucian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-442\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-444\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-443","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
