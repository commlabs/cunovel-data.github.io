The guard downed the contents in one long swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Raymond went upstairs to bed, Flannaghan took over his nightly ritual of checking all the locks on the windows and doors to make certain the house was secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra tried to go to her bedroom, but Colin intercepted her just as she was reaching for her doorknob. He took hold of her hand and pulled her along with him back to the study. He didn\u0027t say a word to her, just nudged her inside and then pulled the door closed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time had come to explain in full her unusual circumstances, she supposed. She walked over to the hearth and stood there warming her hands with the heat of the fire Flannaghan had thoughtfully prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin watched her, but he didn\u0027t say a word. She finally turned around to look at him. He was leaning against the door with his arms folded across his chest. He wasn\u0027t frowning and he didn\u0027t look at all angry—just thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put you in danger tonight,\" she whispered. \"I should have explained everything right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to agree with that statement of fact. He surprised her by shaking his head. \"This is as much my fault as yours, Alesandra. I could have insisted you explain your circumstances. I was too caught up in my own affairs to pay much attention to you. I\u0027ve been remiss as your guardian. That, however, has changed. You\u0027re going to tell me everything, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped her hands together. \"None of this is your fault, sir. I didn\u0027t believe I would be staying here long enough to bother you with my problems, especially after you explained you had no intention of getting married for a long while. I also believed the general would send an ambassador to request my return. I misjudged, you see. I thought he would be civilized. He isn\u0027t. He\u0027s obviously determined… and desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears came into her eyes. She took a deep breath to try to gain control of her emotions. \"I\u0027m so sorry for what happened tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin took mercy on her. \"You weren\u0027t responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were after me,\" she argued. \"Not Raymond or you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin finally moved. He walked over to the chair behind his desk, sat down, and propped his feet up on the nearby footrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does this general want you to come home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t my home,\" she corrected. \"I wasn\u0027t even born there. My father was king, you see, until he married my mother. She was English and considered an outsider. Father stepped down so he could marry her and his younger brother, Edward, became ruler. It was all very polite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin didn\u0027t remark on her explanation and she didn\u0027t have any idea what he was thinking. \"Would you like me to continue?\" she asked, her worry obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to explain why the general wants you to come home,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father was loved by his subjects. They didn\u0027t condemn him because he married my mother. In fact, they found it all very romantic. He did give up his kingdom for her, after all, and everyone who met my mother adored her. She was a dear, kindhearted woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you resemble your mother in appearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then she was also a beautiful woman, wasn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had just given her a compliment, but she had difficulty accepting it. Her mother had been so much more than simply beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A compliment shouldn\u0027t make you frown,\" Colin remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother was beautiful,\" she said. \"But she also had a pure heart. I wish I was more like her, Colin. My thoughts are rarely pure. I was so angry tonight I wanted to hurt those men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found his first smile. \"I did hurt them,\" he reminded her. \"Now please continue with your explanation. I\u0027m anxious to hear the rest of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father\u0027s brother died just last year and the country was once again thrown into turmoil. There seems to be a notion held by some that I should come home. The general wants marriage and believes he\u0027ll be able to secure the throne if I become his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does he believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a sigh. \"Because I\u0027m the only surviving heir to the throne. Everyone has conveniently forgotten my father abdicated. As I said before, he was well loved by his subjects and that love…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t go on. Colin was intrigued by the faint blush on her cheeks. \"And that love what?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has been transferred to me,\" she blurted out. \"At least, that is what Sir Richards of your War Department explained to me, and all the letters I\u0027ve received over the years from the loyalists would confirm his supposition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin straightened in his chair. \"You know Sir Richards?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. \"He has been quite helpful to me. Why do you look so surprised? Is something wrong? You reacted with quite a startle at the mention of his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"How is the head of England\u0027s security section involved in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know Sir Richards too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her turn to look startled. And appalled. \"But he runs the secret… Colin, if you work for him you must be involved in dangerous work. What do your parents think of this double life you lead? Oh, sir, no wonder you have no wish to marry. Your wife would worry all the time. Yes, she would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin regretted telling her the truth. \"I used to work for him,\" he qualified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell he was lying to her. The proof was in his eyes. They\u0027d gone… cold, hard. She decided not to argue with him. If he wanted her to think he wasn\u0027t involved with the Security Section, she would pretend to believe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How and why did Sir Richards get involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis irritated tone of voice pulled her back to the primary topic. \"He came to see me just the day before your father became ill. He and his associates—or superiors, as he referred to them—wish me to marry General Ivan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he knows the general?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"He knows of him,\" she explained. \"Sir Richards considers Ivan the lesser of two evils.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin let out a low expletive. She pretended she didn\u0027t hear it. \"Sir Richards told your father the general would be easier to control. England wants the continuation of imports and the general would certainly look upon your country as a friend if I had been convinced by your leaders to marry Ivan. There is another man eager to snatch the throne and Sir Richards believes he\u0027s more ruthless. He also believes he wouldn\u0027t cooperate with trade agreements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re the sacrificial lamb, is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did my father say to Sir Richards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started twisting her hands together. \"The director can be very persuasive. Your father listened to his argument and then promised to consider the matter. After Richards left, he decided against the marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her gaze to her hands, saw how red her skin had become, and immediately relaxed her grip. \"I cried,\" she confessed. \"I\u0027m ashamed to admit that, but I did cry. I was very upset. Your mother became furious with your father and I was the cause of a heated argument. That made me feel even more miserable. I felt I was disappointing everyone by being selfish. My only excuse is that my parents had such a happy marriage and I wanted to find that same kind of joy. I didn\u0027t believe I would ever find love or happiness married to a man who only wanted me for political gain. I\u0027ve never met the general, but Raymond and Stefan have told me stories about him. If half of what they said is true, he\u0027s a very self-indulgent man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra paused to take a deep breath. \"Your father has a soft heart. He couldn\u0027t stand to see me upset. And he had made a promise to my father to take care of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he decided you should marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. \"It was his hope, but he wasn\u0027t counting on it. Otherwise your mother would have had your name written down on the invitations. Understand, sir, I was being fanciful when I told your father I wanted to marry for love. I realize that isn\u0027t possible now, given the urgency of finding a husband, and so I decided I would consider the marriage a business arrangement. In return for the use of my considerable inheritance, my husband would go his way and I would go mine. I thought I would travel… and in time, perhaps, go back to Holy Cross. It was very peaceful there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what to make of that muttered blasphemy. She frowned in reaction and then said, \"I also hoped that eventually my husband and I would become friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And lovers?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \"Anything is possible, Colin, given time and patience. However, I have had time to reevaluate my position. Granted, the gentlemen in England seem to be more civilized, and I had hoped to find one who was at least ethical, but tonight I realized none of it matters anymore. I\u0027m going to cooperate. I\u0027ll marry the general. I\u0027ve caused quite enough trouble. Perhaps in time this man will learn to… soften in his attitudes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin snorted. \"A snake doesn\u0027t ever stop slithering. He won\u0027t change, and you aren\u0027t going to marry him. Got that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered over the harshness in his voice. \"I want your agreement, Alesandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t give it. She kept picturing the blood pouring down Raymond\u0027s face. \"I won\u0027t be the cause of any more…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra walked over to stand in front of his desk. He motioned her closer with the crook of his finger. She edged her way around the side and stopped when she was just a foot away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The general would give up his plan and leave me alone if I had a husband… wouldn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combination of fear and hope in her voice bothered the hell out of him. She was too young to have such worries. Alesandra should be as scatterbrained and as giddy as his younger sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it all, she was in need of a champion. He reached out and took hold of her hands. She realized she was gripping them together again. She tried to relax. She couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage to the general is out of the question. Are we agreed on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed her hands until she nodded. \"Good,\" he remarked then. \"Have you left anything out in your explanation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin smiled. \"No one bucks the head of security,\" he remarked then, referring to Sir Richards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he did, didn\u0027t he?\" He was inordinately pleased with his father. \"I\u0027ll talk to Richards tomorrow and see if we can\u0027t get his support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nod was quick. \"Since my family is responsible for you, I\u0027ll set up a meeting with my father and my brother as soon as they\u0027re feeling well again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what purpose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To figure out what the hell to do with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d meant the remark as a jest of sorts. She took it to heart. She jerked her hands away from his. His bluntness had offended her. Alesandra had an extremely tender nature. He considered suggesting she learn to toughen her emotional hide, then decided not to offer that advice because she would probably take that as an insult too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not become a burden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You implied it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t ever imply. I always tell it the way it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and walked toward the door. \"I believe it\u0027s time to reevaluate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve already done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to again,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of nausea caught Colin by surprise. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His stomach growled, too, and he assumed his sudden weak condition was due to the fact that he had skipped dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced himself to think about her last remark. \"What are you going to reevaluate now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our arrangement,\" she explained. \"It isn\u0027t working out. I really believe I should find other lodgings tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alesandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t raised his voice but the bite was still there in his hard tone. She stopped at the entrance and turned to look at him. She braced herself for his next hurtful bit of honesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt like hell when he saw the tears in her eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he muttered. \"You aren\u0027t a burden. Your current situation, however, is a mess. Wouldn\u0027t you agree with that evaluation?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin rubbed his brow in an absentminded action and was surprised to feel the perspiration there. He tugged on his cravat next. Damn, it was hot in the study. The fire from the hearth was putting out more heat than was necessary, he supposed. He thought about taking off his jacket but was too weary to go to the trouble now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a very serious situation, Colin,\" she added when he didn\u0027t respond to her earlier agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it isn\u0027t the end of the world, is it? You\u0027re looking overwhelmed by it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am overwhelmed,\" she cried out. \"Raymond was injured tonight. Have you already forgotten? He could have been killed. And you… you could have been hurt too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was frowning again. She was almost sorry she\u0027d reminded him of the incident. She decided not to end the evening on such a sour note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve forgotten my manners,\" she blurted out. \"I should say thank you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you apologized,\" she explained. \"I know it was difficult for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how would you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your voice got all gruff, and you were glaring at me. Yes, it was difficult. Yet you did say you were sorry. That makes your apology all the more pleasing to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked back over to his side. Before she lost her courage, she leaned forward and kissed him on his cheek. \"I still prefer your father for my guardian,\" she told him, hoping to gain a smile. \"He\u0027s much easier to…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was searching for the right word. He gave it to her. \"Manipulate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My four little sisters have worn him down. He\u0027s been turned into milk toast by all those women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin let out a weary sigh and rubbed his brow again. He\u0027d developed a pounding headache in the last few minutes, and he could barely concentrate on the topic at hand. \"Go to bed, Alesandra. It\u0027s late and you\u0027ve had quite a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to leave, then paused. \"Are you feeling all right? Your face looks terribly pale to me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-10.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
