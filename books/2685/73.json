I try watching some TV but the kid starts moving around and I get freaked out so I go into my room where Mary is laying on the mattress, the lights off, the room dark, with the windows open but still hot and I look over at her and ask if she wants to split a joint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t say anything, just moves her head real slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to leave, when Mary says, “Hey, man … stay … why don’t you … stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her. “Do you want to know what I’m thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth moves, eyes rolled up. “… No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m thinking, man, this girl is so f**ked up,” I tell her. “I’m thinking any girl who hangs out with Peter is so f**ked up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else are you thinking?” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” I shrug. “I’m … horny.” Pause. “Peter won’t be home until—when? Midnight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And … what else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit, why not stick around and see what happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You …” she swallows. “Don’t … want to see that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down on the mattress next to her and she tries to sit up but settles for leaning against the wall and asks me about my day at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?” I ask. “You want to know about my day at the car wash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What … happened?” She breathes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a car wash,” I tell her. “There was a freaky little kid. It was all really interesting. Maybe the most interesting day of my life.” I’m tired and the joint I light goes out too soon and I reach over her and take matches that are next to a spoon and a dirty plastic bag on the other side of the mattress and light the joint and ask her how she met up with Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t say anything for a long time and I can’t say I’m surprised. When she does it’s in a low soft voice that I can barely hear and I lean in closer and she mumbles something and I have to ask her what she’s saying, her breath smelling like something almost dead. From the radio the Eagles are singing “Take It Easy” and I’m trying to hum along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peter did some … bad stuff out … in the desert …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?” I ask. “I, like, don’t f**king doubt it.” Another toke and then, “Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods like she’s grateful I’ve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We met a guy in Carson … and he turned us on to some real heavy … shit.” She starts licking her lips and I’m getting sad. “And … we hung out with him … for a little while … and the guy was real nice and once when Peter went out to get some donuts … he went out to get some donuts … and this guy and I started fooling around. It was nice… .” She’s so far off, so druggy, that I get turned on and she stops and looks at me to make sure I’m here, listening to this. “Peter walked in …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand is on her knee and it looks like she doesn’t care and I nod again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what he did?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who? Peter?” I ask. “What?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-informers/page-73.html","bookId":2685,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:55 AM"}
