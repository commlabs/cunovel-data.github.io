There were tracks leading off into the field, off toward Wawona. The kids probably went that way. If I’d known that it was only kids, I’d have gone after them. Bad stuff’s happening in the east.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Sally narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. “You said you saw Fluffy? Anyone else around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With all that’s going on? Everybody’s around, and I have half a dozen people out looking for Tom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSally narrowed her eyes. “How fast could you get them together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty fast. But it’d have to be for a good reason. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starting to have a thought here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of thought?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A dangerous one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Tell me, girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM NIX’S JOURNAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do zoms eat only living creatures?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirsthand accounts of zoms say that they will attack and eat any living creature. Humans, animals, birds, insects, and reptiles. No one knows if they will attack fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been speculated that it is warm, living flesh that attracts the zombies’ appetites, but then how do you explain zoms who eat insects? Insects don’t have much body heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat alone can’t be what attracts them, because if that was the case they’d continue to feed on the recently dead. But they don’t. Once something has died, zoms lose interest pretty quickly. (It takes hours for a body to cool to room temperature.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf zombies are attracted to warm flesh, then they should logically be compelled to feast longer on victims in warmer climates and less so on victims in cooler climates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoms don’t attack people who are wearing cadaverine. Is it smell that attracts them? That doesn’t make sense, because a freshly killed person or animal doesn’t smell like decaying flesh, but zoms stop eating it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIS DOESN’T MAKE SENSE, AND IT’S DRIVING ME CRAZY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e50\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“HOW FAR IS IT TO YOSEMITE?” BENNY ASKED, PEERING AHEAD TO the hazy mass of dark green in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix fanned a cloud of gnats away from her face. “Not sure. How far do you think we’ve come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny glanced at the sun. “We’ve been walking for three hours. With this terrain, figure about three miles an hour. Maybe a little less. Call it two and a half, which means we’ve come about seven to eight miles since we left the way station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix tugged her journal out of its pocket and flipped open to one of the pages of maps she’d painstakingly copied. There was one map that showed the eastern side of Mariposa County, with the town of Mountainside circled. A strip of cardboard with incremental mile marks measured onto it was clipped to the page. Nix removed it and found another circled spot marked BD/WS. Brother David’s way station. “Tom said he wanted to take us to Wawona, over near the Merced River.” She did some math in her head and announced, “We could be as close as eight miles to Wawona.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of the big hotel, with its frequent travelers and patrolled woods, was comforting. Maybe if they regrouped there, they could actually make a decent start on the trip to find the jet. “Someone at the hotel might have seen the jet,” Benny said. “Tom says that there are travelers through there all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like Preacher Jack,” Nix reminded him, then added under her breath, “Freak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny nodded and pulled out his canteen for a drink. “We’ll be careful. Besides, Tom will know that’s where we went.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the last of the Greenman’s strawberries and gave Benny half of them. “I would love one of Tom’s Sunday dinners right about now. A big steak so rare it would moo when I stuck my fork in it. Spinach and sweet corn. And those honey biscuits he makes from my mom’s recipes. And one of his apple pies with raisins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With raisins and walnuts,” corrected Benny. “It’s important.” They walked, thinking about a feast. “They’ll have plenty of food at the hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they don’t, I’m going to bite your arm off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe joke conjured an image of her from his dream. “Come on, Nix,” he said quickly. “We can be there in a couple of hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back the way they’d come. “They will find us, won’t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” he said, and for the first time today he actually meant it. “And we’ll be okay until they do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fields, valleys, and meadows through which they’d walked had been clear of serious threats. They’d spotted a few zoms, but each time, Benny and Nix circled around them and kept moving. Neither of them felt any desire to attack zoms unless there was no choice. Last year, on his first trip into the Ruin, Benny and Tom had spied on a trio of bounty hunters who were beating and torturing zombies for fun. The men were laughing and having a good time; however, Benny was instantly sickened by the sight, and the memory was like an open wound in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go,” Nix said, and they began walking again. Even though it was early April and they were in higher elevations, the sun was hot. Most of the clouds had burned off, and neither of them had a hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” gasped Benny, reaching for his canteen again, “we should sit some of this out and start again when the sun’s not four inches from the top of our heads.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m for that,” Nix agreed glumly, then brightened and pointed. “Look! Apples.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the road and cut through a field to an overgrown orchard. They collected an armload of apples and settled down with their backs to a bullet-pocked stone wall. The stones were cool, and the apples were sweet. There was a burned-out farmhouse nearby, and beyond that was a barn that had once been painted bright red but that fourteen years had faded to a shade of rust resembling dried blood. A line of crows stood along the peaked roof, dozing in the afternoon heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny and Nix took off their sweltering carpet coats, and both of them were soaked with sweat. Benny was so exhausted that he was almost—almost—too weary to notice how Nix’s clothes were pasted to her body. He quietly banged his head on the stone wall. Then he closed his eyes and tried counting to fifty million. Eventually he opened his eyes and busied himself slicing apples for them. After a while, Nix pulled out her journal again and started writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Benny asked, munching on a slice of apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Making a list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Things I don’t understand about what’s been happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s going to be a long list. What do you have so far?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chewed the end of her pencil. “Okay, I get the rhinoceros. Zoos and circuses and all. That one makes sense … but what about the guy we found tied to the truck? Who was he and why was he fed to the zoms? And by whom? And worse … why didn’t he reanimate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny glumly shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does it mean?” Nix asked. “What could it mean? Is the plague or radiation or whatever it is wearing off? Or are we just now discovering that some people are immune to it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wouldn’t we know that already?” Benny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With three hundred million zoms in America? How would anyone know, especially if it was rare?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bounty hunters would know,” insisted Benny. “Tom would have known. He’s all over the place. He hears all sorts of stuff. If that’s been happening, then he knows about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” she said, nodding thoughtfully, “I’ll buy that … but wouldn’t that mean the other idea is more likely?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That whatever caused the zoms to rise in the first place might be coming to an end?” Benny thought about it. “That would be pretty amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it’s true …,” Nix said dubiously. “Then there’s the big weirdness at the way station. Brother David, Shanti, and Sarah missing. And all the stuff Tom sent for our road trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the zoms,” Benny added. “Tom told me that sometimes a bunch of zoms would follow something, like a herd of wild horses or a running bear. He called it ‘flocking.’ Is that what we saw last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way,” Nix said firmly. “Last night was no accident. It felt like a planned attack. I think someone drove them down out of the mountains like Lilah did with the zoms from the Hungry Forest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate their apples in silence for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix,” Benny said tentatively, “there’s … something I have to tell you. Something I didn’t want to say last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it about Lilah?” Nix said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lilah? What about her? Because she ran off?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix colored. “No, never mind. Go ahead … what were you going to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a breath. “Last night … when we were in the field with all those zoms? Before I started the fire? I … um … saw someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny cleared his throat. “It was dark. I was scared. There were a million freaking zoms, so I can’t be sure and I’m probably wrong, but … I think I saw Charlie Pink-eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whipped around and grabbed his sleeve with her small, strong fists. She shook him. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa! Ow, you’re banging my head against the stones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix abruptly stopped shaking him, but her fists stayed knotted in his sleeve. “You saw him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I said I wasn’t sure. The dark and the zoms and all—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was he alive or a zom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t lie to me, Benny Imura!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not—I don’t know. It was just a second. I—I think he might have been alive, but the zoms weren’t attacking him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He could have had cadaverine on, Benny, just like we did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But something wasn’t right about it. It might not even have been him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix stared into his eyes for a long time and then let him go with a little push. She suddenly got up and walked a dozen paces away, her arms wrapped tightly around her chest as if she stood in a cold wind. Benny got up more slowly but stayed by the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her as she worked it through. Every angle of her body seemed jagged and sharp, her posture charged with tension. Benny could only imagine what horrors were playing out in Nix’s mind. The man who had beaten and murdered her mother and then kidnapped her. The thought that somehow Charlie had orchestrated the zombie assault on the way station was horrible. It also made a queer kind of sense, since a swarm of zombies had been used to destroy Charlie’s team. An eye for an eye?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored him, standing stiff and trembling under the unrelenting sun. Benny waited for her. Three minutes passed. Four. Five. Gradually, by slow and painful degrees, the harsh lines of tension drained from Nix’s shoulders and back. When she turned around, Benny could see unshed tears in the corners of her eyes. She looked at him blankly for a moment, and then her eyes snapped wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer warning was a half second too late, as cold hands clamped onto Benny from behind and dragged him backward over the stone wall. Benny twisted wildly around and saw the face of the zom who had him. A tall, thin man dressed in a tunic that looked like it had been made from an old bedsheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Benny cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Brother David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM NIX’S JOURNAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotes from Mrs. Griswold’s science lecture on how cadaverine is made:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cadaverine used in the Rot and Ruin is actually a mixture of cadaverine, putrescine, spermidine, and other vile ptomaines. The pure compounds are caustic, toxic stuff although they can be easily diluted in water or ethanol (but not really diluting the aroma).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking these compounds is not a project for a home basement chem lab or even a high school lab. The glassware, equipment, and chemicals are usually found in college level or industrial labs, and that equipment has been scavenged and brought to Mountainside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original method comes from a German journal dating back to about 1890. This method for reacting dichloropropane with sodium cyanide (a deadly poison) followed by reaction with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid. This gives cadaverine. Yuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e51\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOM KNELT BY A COLD CAMPFIRE AND STUDIED THE GROUND. THIS WAS the second place where he’d found Chong’s footprints and signs of violence. The first time had been the spot where Sally Two-Knives had tried to rescue Chong. There were indeed two dead men there, and Tom recognized them. Denny Spurling and Patch Lewis, bounty hunters of the low-life variety who usually ran with a third man named Stosh Lowinski. These were two of the three men Benny had seen torturing and brutalizing zoms on their first trip into the Ruin. Stosh, a beefy man who used a replica Arabian scimitar to kill zoms, was not here. Sally had given them a little taste of their own medicine. Rough justice, but justice of a kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom knew Sally’s history. She’d been a rough, hard-edged Roller-Derby blocker with one of the Rat City Rollergirl teams out of Seattle when First Night changed the world. Sally had been the mother of two little kids, and she’d fought her way across Seattle to her small apartment where her mother was minding April and Toby. By the time Sally got to the apartment building, the lobby was splashed with blood. It took her a couple of years to tell Tom the whole story. It came out in broken fragments, and none of it was pretty. There were no happy endings, and when she reached her tenth-floor apartment, all she found was heartbreak. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dust-and-decay-benny-imura-2/page-29.html","bookId":2582,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM"}
