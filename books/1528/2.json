A familiar tingle ran along her limbs. Her throat burned warmly as Apollo entered her. Her vision began to close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the child was smaller, more susceptible to the pneuma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl’s head rolled back; her eyelids drooped. Surely she would not survive Apollo’s penetration for long. Still, if there was to be any hope, the girl had to be put to the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Child,” Pythia rang out, “tell us more of this boy and the doom he whispered to you. Where will he rise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small lips moved in a whisper. “From me. From my dreams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall fingers found Pythia’s hand and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords continued to spill from the girl’s lips. “Your house is empty…your springs have dried up. But a new spring of prophecy will flow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePythia’s arms tightened on the girl. For too long, ruin had lingered over the temple. “A new spring.” Hope rang in her voice. “Here at Delphi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePythia’s breath grew more rapid. “Then from where will it spring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl’s lips moved, but no words came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook the girl. “Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl lifted a boneless arm and placed a hand on her own belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that touch, a vision swelled through Pythia, of silver waters gushing from the girl’s navel, from out of her womb. A new spring. But was it a vision from Apollo? Or was it born from her own hope?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream pierced her daze. Hard voices echoed down. From the stairs, a figure stumbled into view. It was one of the elders who had tended the fire. She clutched a hand to her shoulder. A crimson bloom spread from under her palm. The black head of an arrow protruded between her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too late,” the old woman cried out and collapsed to her knees. “The Romans…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePythia heard the woman’s words but remained lost in the vapors. Behind her eyes, she pictured the spring flowing from the girl, a new font of prophetic power. But Pythia also smelled the smoke from the Roman torches. Blood and smoke leaked into her vision. The silver spring now ran with a thin stream of black crimson and swept into the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child suddenly sagged in her arms, completely lost to the pneuma’s vapors. Still, as Pythia studied the vision, she watched the dark stream form a black figure…the shadow of a boy. Flames rose behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child’s words from a moon ago echoed to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brother of the Hebrew boy…he who would set fire to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePythia held the limp girl. The child’s prophecy hinted at both doom and salvation. Perhaps it would be best to leave her to the Imperial legion, to end such an uncertain future here. From overhead, hard voices echoed down. There was already no escape. Except in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the vision swelled in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApollo had sent the child. To Pythia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new spring will flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, drawing Apollo fully into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat must I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Roman centurion crossed the hall. He had his orders. To slay the girl who spoke of the empire’s doom. Last night, they had captured one of the temple’s servants, a maid. Under the lash—and before he gave her to his men—she let it be known that the child still remained at the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring the torches!” he yelled. “Search every corner!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement near the back of the hall drew his eye—and his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman appeared from the shadows of a lower stair. She stumbled forward, weaving two steps into view, unsteady, dazed. Dressed all in white, she bore a crown of laurel branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew who stood before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oracle of Delphi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centurion fought back a tremble of fear. Like many of the legion, he still secretly practiced the old ways. Even slaughtered bulls to Mithra and bathed in their blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, a new sun was on the rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no stopping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who dares violate Apollo’s temple?” she called out to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the stony weight of his men’s eyes upon him, the centurion marched to face the woman. “Bring forth the girl!” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is gone. Beyond even your reach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centurion knew that was impossible. The temple was surrounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, worry pushed him forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oracle stepped to block him from the stairs. She held a palm against his breastplate. “The adytum below is forbidden to all men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not to the emperor. And I am under his edict.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refused to move. “You will not pass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centurion had his orders under the seal of Emperor Theodosius, handed to him personally by the emperor’s son Arcadius. The old gods were to be silenced, their old temples torn down. All across the empire, including Delphi. The centurion had been given one additional command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrust his sword deep into the Oracle’s belly and drove it full to the hilt. A gasp escaped her. She fell against his shoulder, as in a lover’s embrace. He shouldered her away from him roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood splashed across his armor, across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oracle slumped to the marble, then to her side. A trembling arm reached to the pool of her own blood. Her palm settled into it. “A new spring…,” she whispered, as if it were a promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her body went slack with death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centurion stepped over her form and let his sword lead him down the stairs to a small blind cave. An old woman’s corpse, arrow-bit, lay in a black pool of blood. A three-legged chair lay toppled beside a riven crack in the floor. He searched the rest of the room and turned a full circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamber was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarch 1959\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarpathian Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomania\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor Yuri Raev climbed out of the Russian ZiS-151 truck and dropped to the rutted dirt road. His legs trembled under him. To steady himself, he leaned a hand on the green steel door of the battered vehicle, both cursing it and thanking it. The rattle of the week-long trek up into the mountains still made his spine ache. Even his molars seemed loose in his skull. Still, it took such a rugged vehicle to climb the stony switchbacks and river-flooded roads to reach this isolated winter camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder as the rear door to the truck’s bed crashed down. Soldiers in black-and-white uniforms hopped out. Their winter garb blended with the snow and granite of the densely wooded highlands. Morning fog still hung in hollows like sullen ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men swore and stamped their boots. Small flickers of fire sparked as cigarettes were dropped or ground out. With a clatter, the soldiers readied their Kalashnikov assault rifles. But they were only the rear guard, meant to keep all away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri faced forward as the second in command of this mission, Lieutenant Dobritsky, marched over. He was a blocky Ukrainian with a pocked face and broken nose, outfitted in winter camouflage. Red rings from his snow goggles still circled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Major, sir, the camp is secure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it them? Who we seek?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDobritsky shrugged, leaving it for Yuri to decide. They’d already had one false alarm, raiding a winter camp of half-starved peasants, who’d been eking out a living by quarrying stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri scowled. These mountains were from another era, Stone-Aged, backward, rife with superstition and poverty. Yet the craggy, forested highlands were also a perfect refuge for those who wished to remain hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri stepped to the side and studied the curve of the rutted track that served as a road. Mud and snow had been churned up by the lead vehicles. Through the trees, Yuri spotted a score of IMZ-Ural motorcycles, each bearing an armed soldier in a sidecar. The heavy bikes had swept up in advance and secured the site, cutting off all means of escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumor and tortured testimony had led to this remote place. And still it had required scouring the highlands and burning a few homesteads to warm the occasional frozen tongues. Few were willing to speak of the Carpathian Romani. Especially with the stories spoken about this isolated clan in particular, whispers of strigoi and moroi. Evil spirits and witches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut had he found them at long last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Dobritsky shifted his boots. “What now, Major?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri noted the sour turn to the Ukrainian’s lips. Though Yuri was a major in the Soviet army, he was no soldier. He stood a head shorter than Dobritsky, with a slight paunch to his belly and a doughy face. Recruited from Leningrad State University, he had risen to his position through the ranks of the military’s scientific branches. At the age of twenty-eight, he was already chief of the biophysics laboratory at the State Control Institute of Medical and Biological Research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is Captain Martov?” Yuri asked. The representative of Soviet Military Intelligence seldom left Dobritsky’s side and kept an officious eye on all matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Waiting for us at the camp’s entrance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDobritsky slogged a straight path up the road’s center. Yuri sidestepped to the edge, where the ground was still frozen and the walking easier. Reaching the last switchback, the lieutenant pointed toward a camp sheltered in a cover of steep crags and surrounded by black woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gypsies,” Dobritsky grunted. “As you ordered, da?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut is this the right Romani clan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, the Gypsy wagons were painted in faded hues of green and black, with wheels as tall as Yuri. Some paint had peeled and flaked to reveal bolder colors hidden beneath, peeks at happier times. The tall wooden wagons were piled with snow and fringed by icicles along the sides. Windows were etched with frost. Blackened pits marked old bonfires. Two fires were still lit deeper in the winter camp, casting flames as high as the tallest wagon. Another wagon stood shattered and burned to a husk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo one side, a few swaybacked draft horses hung their heads dully from beneath a lean-to of salvaged wood planks and piled stones. Goats and a few sheep ambled through the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers had the site surrounded. A few dead bodies in ragged clothes and furred jackets lay sprawled here and there. The living looked little better. The camp’s residents had been hauled from their wagons and heavy tents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts rose from deeper in the camp as the last of the Gypsies were rounded up. A spatter of automatic gunfire sounded. Kalashnikovs. Yuri observed the grim-eyed crowd. Some of the women were on their knees, sobbing. The dark men were steely in their black regard of the intruders. Most were bloody, wounded, broken-limbed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-2.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
