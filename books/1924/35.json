Frowning, I pushed to my feet and headed over to it. Had Megumi misunderstood and thought we were meeting here? Not that I minded, but …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Eva,” the guy at the front desk said cheerfully. “NYPD detectives Michna and Graves are here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. Everything else lost significance in that moment. Fear spread through me with crawling fingers of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted a lawyer with me. Too much was on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn’t want to seem like I had anything to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to swallow twice before I could answer. “Thanks. Can you send them up, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY HEART WAS pounding as I hurried to my purse and silenced the burner phone, tucking it into a zippered pocket. I turned around, looking for anything that might be out of place, anything I should hide. There were the flowers in my bedroom and the card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless the detectives had a warrant, though, they could only take note of what was in plain sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to shut my door, then went ahead and shut Cary’s, too. I was breathing hard when the doorbell rang. I had to force myself to slow down and walk calmly to the living room. When I reached the front door, I took a deep, calming breath before opening it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, detectives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves, a rail-thin woman with a severe face and foxlike blue eyes, was in the lead. Her partner, Michna, was the quieter of the two, an older man with receding gray hair and a paunch. They had a rhythm between the two of them—Graves was the heavy who kept the subjects occupied and off-balance. Michna was obviously good at fading into the background while his cop’s eyes cataloged everything and missed nothing. Their success rate had to be pretty high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we come in, Miss Tramell?” Graves asked in a tone that made the question a demand. She’d tied her curly brown hair back and wore a jacket to cover her holstered gun. There was a satchel in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” I pulled the door open wider. “Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Water would be great,” Michna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led them to the kitchen and pulled bottled water out of the fridge. The detectives waited at the breakfast bar—Graves with her eyes pinned to me while Michna scoped out his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just get home from work?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured they knew the answer, but replied anyway. “A few minutes ago. Would you like to sit in the living room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here’s good,” Graves said in her no-nonsense way, putting the worn leather satchel on the counter. “We’d just like to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind. And show you some photos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stilled. Could I bear to see any of the photos Nathan had taken of me? For a wild moment, I thought they might be pictures taken at the death scene or even autopsy shots. But I knew that was highly unlikely. “What’s this about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some new information has come to light that could be related to Nathan Barker’s death,” Michna said. “We’re pursuing all leads, and you may be able to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep, shaky breath. “I’m happy to try, of course. But I don’t see how I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you familiar with Andrei Yedemsky?” Graves asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at her. “No. Who’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dug in her bag and pulled out a sheaf of eight-by-ten photos, setting them down in front of me. “This man. Have you seen him before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out with shaking fingers, I pulled the top photo toward me. It was of a man in a trench coat, talking to another man about to climb into the back of a waiting town car. He was attractive, with extremely blond hair and tanned skin. “No. He’s not someone you’d forget meeting, either.” I looked up at her. “Should I know him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He had pictures of you in his home. Candid shots of you on the street, coming and going. Barker had the same photos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand. How did he get them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Presumably from Barker,” Michna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what this Yedemsky guy said? Why would Nathan give him pictures of me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yedemsky didn’t say anything,” Graves said. “He’s dead. Murdered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a headache coming on. “I don’t understand. I don’t know anything about this man, and I have no idea why he’d know anything about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrei Yedemsky is a known member of the Russian mob,” Michna explained. “In addition to smuggling alcohol and assault weapons, they’ve also been suspected of trafficking women. It’s possible Barker was making arrangements to sell or trade you for that purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed away from the counter, shaking my head, unable to process what they were saying. Nathan stalking me was something I could believe. He’d hated me on sight, hated that his father had remarried instead of mourning his mother forever. He’d hated me for getting him locked up in psychiatric treatment, and my being awarded the five-million-dollar settlement he thought of as his inheritance. But the Russian mob? Sex trafficking? I couldn’t comprehend that at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves flipped through the photos until she came to one of a platinum sapphire bracelet. An L-square ruler framed it—unmistakably a forensics shot. “Do you recognize this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. That belonged to Nathan’s mother. He had it altered to fit him. He never went anywhere without it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yedemsky was wearing it when he died,” she said without inflection. “Possibly as a souvenir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of Barker’s murder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Graves, who knew better. “You’re suggesting Yedemsky could be responsible for Nathan’s death? Then who killed Yedemsky?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held my gaze, understanding the motivation behind my question. “He was taken out by his own people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure about that?” I needed to know that they knew Gideon wasn’t involved. Yes, he’d killed for me—to protect me—but he’d never kill just to avoid going to jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichna frowned at my query. It was Graves who replied. “There’s no doubt. We have the hit on surveillance footage. One of his associates didn’t take too kindly to Yedemsky sleeping with his underage daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope surged, followed by chilling fear. “So what happens now? What does this mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know anyone who has connections to the Russian mob?” Michna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, no,” I said vehemently. “That’s … another world. I’m having trouble believing Nathan had any connections. But then it’s been years since I knew him …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed at the tightness in my chest and looked at Graves. “I want to put this behind me. I want him to stop ruining my life. Is that ever going to happen? Is he going to haunt me even after he’s dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickly and efficiently collected the photos, her face impassive. “We’ve done all we can. Where you go from here is up to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed up at CrossTrainer at quarter after six. I went because I’d told Megumi I would and I’d already flaked on her once. I also felt a tremendous restlessness, an urge to move that I had to exhaust before it drove me insane. I’d sent a text to Gideon as soon as the detectives left, telling him I needed to see him later, but I hadn’t heard back by the time I’d put my purse in a locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike all things Gideon, CrossTrainer was impressive in both size and amenities. The three-story club—one of hundreds around the country—had everything a fitness enthusiast could want, as well as spa services and a smoothie bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegumi was slightly overwhelmed and needed help with some of the high-tech machinery, so she was taking advantage of the trainer-supervised workout for new members and guests. I got on a treadmill. I started out at a brisk walk, warming up, and then eventually progressed to a run. Once I hit my stride, I let my thoughts run, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it possible that Gideon and I were free to pick up the pieces of our lives and move on? How? Why? My mind raced with questions that I needed to ask Gideon—with the hope that he was as clueless as I was. He couldn’t be involved in Yedemsky’s death. I wouldn’t believe he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran until my thighs and calves burned, until sweat ran down my body in steady streams and my lungs ached with the effort of breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Megumi who finally got me to stop, waving her hand in my line of sight as she moved in front of my treadmill. “I am so totally impressed right now. You’re a machine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowed my pace to a jog, then a walk, before stopping altogether. Grabbing my towel and water bottle, I stepped off, feeling the effects of pushing myself too long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate running,” I confessed, still panting. “How’d your workout go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegumi looked chic even in gym clothes. Her chartreuse racerback tank had bright blue threading that matched her spandex leggings. The ensemble was summer-bright and stylish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bumped shoulders with me. “You make me feel like an underachiever. I just did a circuit and checked out the hot guys. The trainer I worked with was good, but I wish I’d gotten that guy instead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed the point of her finger. “That’s Daniel. Want to meet him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked with her toward the mats in the center of the open space, waving at Daniel when he lifted his gaze and caught sight of us. Megumi quickly yanked out the rubber band holding her hair back, but I thought she’d looked great with it on, too. She had beautiful skin and I envied her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva, great seeing you.” Daniel extended his hand to me for a shake. “Who’s this you have with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My friend Megumi. She just joined today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw you working with Tara.” He flashed Megumi his megawatt smile. “I’m Daniel. If you ever need help with anything, just let me know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to take you up on that,” she warned, as she shook his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please do. Do you have any particular fitness goals?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/entwined-with-you-crossfire-3/page-35.html","bookId":1924,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
