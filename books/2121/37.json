Forsyth took a quick step and looked through the keyhole. \"It\u0027s all right,\" he declared, unlocking the door. A stern, elegant woman with a white streak in her raven hair strode into the room, followed by two servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss had always been a little afraid of Warden Cutler. The Elder had been the one who had probed her mind for Silver Blood corruption. She still remembered the disquieting feeling of being judged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the Watcher?\" Nan Cutler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobiAnne indicated the bundle at the far end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve put her in stasis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForsyth nodded. \"Yes. It\u0027s going to be a long time until she wakes up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found her with this,\" BobiAnne said, handing Jordan\u0027s weapon to the Warden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to find a way to destroy it; it\u0027s too dangerous for us to use,\" Forsyth said. \"I thought that spell was enough to hold it in the vault, but obviously she was able to disarm it. She\u0027s too clever by half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there is a way to destroy it,\" Nan said. \"It\u0027s not susceptible to the Black Fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be able to manage?\" Forsyth asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be followed?\" BobiAnne wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss watched as the grim-faced Warden shook her head. \"No, we will not be followed. We will make sure of that. It is amazing she waited this long, really, to make her move. But do not worry, I will make certain that she is no longer a threat to us.\" She looked with disdain in the direction of the comforter. \"Cordelia Van Alen was weak minded as usual to think sending the Watcher into your family would solve anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She suspected, then?\" BobiAnne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she suspected,\" Forsyth snapped. \"You don\u0027t give her enough credit, Nan. That bird was sharp. She knew something was up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pity her little assassin was as ineffectual as she was, then.\" Nan signaled, and her servants picked up the bundle and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss had no idea what they were talking about, but was desperate to find out. What did Cordelia Van Alen suspect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to hurry,\" BobiAnne said to her husband. \"The dinner starts in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForsyth nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on? Where are you going?\" Bliss asked, fighting tears of frustration. \"Where are they taking Jordan?\" She wondered what had sparked her little sister to do something so crazy. But her parents refused to explain or tell her anything more than the cryptic comments they\u0027d made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left for the big dinner at the Almeidas\u0027, as if nothing at all had happened. BobiAnne even told Bliss she could order anything she wanted off the room-service menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer younger sister, who used to follow her around, trying to emulate her every move. At five Jordan had wanted big curly hair like her sister, and forced the maids to use a curling iron on her stubbornly straight locks, so that her hair would resemble her sister\u0027s. Jordan, who had called her \"Biss\" when she was a baby because she couldn\u0027t pronounce her name correctly. Jordan, who\u0027d offered her chocolate and comfort just the other day. Bliss found that there were tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss understood that she would never see Jordan again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy these tears ? A low, sympathetic voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan tried to hurt Bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. But she was my sister. My friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of friend brings pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss suddenly remembered how she\u0027d felt as if she were being torn in two. She\u0027d experienced more pain than she had ever felt in her life. Jordan had done that. She had aimed for the heart. She\u0027d tried to kill Bliss with that weapon - something bright and golden, like a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was different from the sword her father kept in his study. The sword Forsyth had used during the attack at the Repository - when the Silver Blood had killed Priscilla Dupont - was a dull yellow gold. The blade Jordan had used emanated a bright white light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNan Cutler had said it couldn\u0027t be destroyed, and Bliss suddenly remembered Mimi\u0027s words: the Blade of Justice was missing. Did her father have Michael\u0027s sword? The only thing in the world that could kill Lucifer? The Archangel\u0027s sword? And if so, why had Jordan used it against her? Bliss felt a pounding headache coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have a choice, her sister had said that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss gradually stopped feeling so sorry for Jordan. She began to feel glad that they had taken her away. Wherever they\u0027d taken her, Jordan deserved to be there. Bliss hoped it was a dark, deep dungeon where Jordan could think for eternity on her crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcellent, said the voice in the back of her mind. She recognized it now. It sounded like the gentleman in the white suit. The one who called her \"Daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen once again she could see, but she could not see. She was going to black out. Yes, it was happening right now. She tried to hold on to her vision, tried to fight it, but the same voice inside her head said, \"Let go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bliss let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found it was sweet relief to surrender. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-37.html","bookId":2121,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
