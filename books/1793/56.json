My roots in this town run as deep as your own. I might be able to save you some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very kind of you, Jeremy,\" Octavia said. \"What do you say, Nick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not going to let up, Nick thought. She wouldn\u0027t be satisfied until he bit the bullet and invited Jeremy out for a beer. Maybe the easiest way out of this mess was to make the offer in front of her. Jeremy would turn it down and then they would both be off the hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch and then at Jeremy. \"It\u0027s nearly five. I want to talk to Gail about what I need her to do at the beauty shop tomorrow. Then I\u0027m going to have dinner with Octavia.\" Out of the corner of his eye he saw her raise her brows at that news. But she kept silent as he expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew where he was going with this and she wasn\u0027t about to put up any roadblocks. \"I figured I\u0027d hit the Total Eclipse later this evening to pick up the latest gossip. You want to join me? I\u0027ll buy you a beer and we can play a little pool, keep our ears open, and see what we come up with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy\u0027s jaw went rigid. But to Nick\u0027s astonishment he moved slightly. It was a single, robotic inclination of the head, but it was a definite nod of acceptance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Jeremy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. Now they were both trapped, Nick thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia looked quietly pleased. She gave him a warm smile of approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn electrifying jolt of awareness shot through him. It was as if the floor of the gallery had opened up beneath his feet and he had plummeted into the abyss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. He had been asking the wrong question all along, he thought. He had been wondering why Octavia insisted on meddling with his life. The really important question here was why was he allowing her to do so?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate at the Crab Trap, surrounded by tourists, summer people, and a sprinkling of locals,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t regret this,\" Octavia said earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" He cracked open a crab leg and went after the tender meat with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremy wouldn\u0027t have agreed to have a drink with you if he still believed that you\u0027d had an affair with his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" He reached for another leg and assaulted it with grim enthusiasm. The sound of crunching shell was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s obvious that he wants to mend the rift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was just looking for an opportunity and now you\u0027ve provided it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" He looked around for another crab leg to destroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the right thing to do, Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like being manipulated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t manipulate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just made a suggestion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, not speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed. \"Okay, it was a forceful suggestion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You nagged me into this meeting tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reddened. \"I\u0027m sorry if you feel that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do feel that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back and folded her napkin very deliberately, her expression troubled now. \"You\u0027re really mad, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m really mad. But mostly at myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re allowing me to strongarm you into this meeting with Jeremy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Her voice was steady but when she put down the napkin, her fingers shook slightly. \"Well, if you feel that way about it, why don\u0027t you cancel the arrangement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled humorlessly, staring into the abyss. \"It\u0027s too late.\" In more ways than you can possibly know, he added silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I can see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEstablishments like the Total Eclipse had their place in the universe, Nick thought. It was, for instance, the one venue in Eclipse Bay where two guys involved in a private feud could meet on neutral territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tavern was starting to fill up for the evening, but the buzz of conversation was muted in the back, where the pool tables were located. Only one other green-topped table was in use at the moment, and mercifully no one was smoking, so the air was still relatively clear. The gloom hung in thick curtains interrupted only by the narrow bright spot over the center of each table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the bar was the place for this conversation, Nick thought, pool was the game. Attitude was everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick adjusted his stance slightly, made a bridge with his fingers, and leaned into the shot. He stroked the cue gently. Going for a little spin. Concentrating on the follow-through, the way his grandfather and father had taught him. The way he would one day teach Carson. He stayed down until the ball dropped into the pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize that we\u0027ve both been set up,\" he said, straightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the table, Jeremy watched him from the shadows. \"I got that impression. But, hey, she\u0027s going to hang my paintings in her gallery. Shooting a little pool with you and letting you buy me a beer doesn\u0027t seem like such a high price to pay for my chance at money and immortal fame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" Nick chalked his cue. \"I figured that was the real reason you agreed. Octavia\u0027s got this compulsion to make things right, you know. Has to do with what her great-aunt did to Harte-Madison all those years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured that much out. She says she\u0027s leaving town at the end of the summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He studied the position of the balls on the table, doing the strategy thing. \"That\u0027s what she says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy studied him across the green felt. \"She also says that you didn\u0027t have an affair with my ex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s right. I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy did not respond to that. But he didn\u0027t hurl any more accusations, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey played for a while, not speaking. The only sounds were the click and snap of the balls striking each other and the gradually rising noise from the front of the tavern. Someone had turned on the music. A country-western rocker was wailing away about a good woman gone bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick dropped another ball into the pocket. \"You know, you\u0027re not the only guy in the world whose wife had an affair.\" He wasn\u0027t sure why he said it. It just seemed the right time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy went still on the other side of the table. \"Amelia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man who was at the controls of that plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus. I didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not many people do. I\u0027d like to keep it that way.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-56.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
