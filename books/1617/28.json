That she could load and fire a gun as well as any man, and yet she had skin, luminous and fair, as if she were crafted of the finest ivory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought she might be a spy, but could it be that she practiced some form of the dark arts? Goose bumps fanned across his skin then ebbed, like a wave washing over the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you… ” His voice was hoarse, grave. “Is it that you\u0027re some sort of… witch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” She laughed then. “Me? A witch? God no.” She shook her head, and then a peculiar look darkened her features. As if she hadn\u0027t before considered such a conclusion, potential ruination narrowly averted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sad half smile quirked her mouth. “Are you kidding? My family? I told you, we\u0027re Irish. Irish Catholic, to put a fine point on the whole thing. I\u0027ve been baptized, first communioned, confirmed… the whole deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley sighed deeply. She looked at him with such sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t sure what to do. What to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still don\u0027t believe me, do you?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I wouldn\u0027t believe me either. Okay-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haley-” he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, let me think.” She knew so much about the time period. Knew about MacColla. What could she tell him to make him believe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wracked her mind for any tidbit from his life that she could recall. She\u0027d taken the seminars, read her David Stevenson. She knew famous bits of trivia that wouldn\u0027t have been so well known in his own time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do this, she thought. She knew things he hadn\u0027t told her. She knew things none of his peers would\u0027ve known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could convince him. Haley shifted, crossing her legs to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dad was imprisoned for years with Campbell. Wait,” she said suddenly, her face blanching. “He\u0027s not still imprisoned, is he?” He shook his head and she made a mental note to try to piece together what had happened to his father, and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your brother Gillespie was with him,” she continued. “There are other brothers too, but I don\u0027t know about them so much… ” she trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t going to cut it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla just smiled at her. “Many know of Campbell\u0027s treachery against my father, leannan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s that poet,” she snapped and pointed her finger at him in excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know… what\u0027s his name?” - she tapped her fingers on her lips - ”Iain Lom MacDonald! He loved you. Wrote all kinds of poems and songs about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla\u0027s scowl turned into a beet red blush. He opened his mouth to speak, but she stopped him. “No, just a minute, I\u0027m not done. He had a nickname. Now thatwouldn\u0027t be public knowledge, would it? The Stuttering MacDonald, maybe? Bald Iain? Well, he stuttered and he was bald, and had some sort of nickname along those lines. I just can\u0027t… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her hand, seeing what looked like growing impatience on his face. “Wait,” she pleaded. If she could only think of that nickname, surely it would be some sort of proof of something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the poet\u0027s nickname? Nickname…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah!” It came out as a yelp, her eyes widened. “I\u0027ve got it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour father!” Haley leaned in, animated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father had a nickname. Colkitto. It was because he was left- handed. Those close to him called him Colkitto.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded silently, his eyes squinting. Whether it was from bafflement or suspicion, she couldn\u0027t tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You see, in my time, for a while people… well historians mistakenly called you Colkitto. They thought you were the left-handed one. People argued about it. But it\u0027s not your nickname, is it? Your father Coll was… is known to his closest friends as Colkitto.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled deeply, smiling in triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not MacColla. His somber face chilled her and stole the curve from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose. And though he offered his hand to help Haley up, his voice was gruff when he said, “We must go. I\u0027m expected in Kintyre. My family waits for me even now. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fret not, leannan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla began to walk, adding. “You\u0027ll soon be able to ask the man for himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he believe her? They\u0027d stopped for a brief rest, and MacColla sat, watching Haley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lass was in her own world, studying his sword as if it could unlock the key to the universe. She\u0027d leapt for it the moment he pulled it from his black leather scabbard to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he believe her fantastical story, or decide simply that she was the loveliest madwoman he\u0027d ever met? Her crazy talk of traveling through time had confounded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you call this a Gallowglass sword?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leannan, you do have the most peculiar questions.” He untied a small leather bladder from his belt and took a deep pull of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped his mouth on his sleeve, amused and disconcerted both. “So you speak the Irish too? Gallóglaigh. Foreign soliders,” he mused. “I\u0027ve not heard that word in some time. Aye, it\u0027s got the look of an Irish sword like those the Gallóglaigh fought with long ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her return her attentions to the blade. She ran her palm along the base of it. It was a simple design, with V-shaped lines that echoed its sharp edges. Haley slowly stroked her hand along the flat of it dipping her fingertip in and out of the etched steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunger clutched hard and fast at MacColla\u0027s chest. He felt it smolder in his eyes and drive straight to his loins, making him rigid with want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it you make a man weak with a mere touch to his blade?” He tried to muster a smile, but could only stare, the pure craving of her pushing out all other thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Claidheamh da lailum,” he rasped. “That\u0027s what that sword is called.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kla… hi… dah… life.” she pronounced slowly. “Two-hand sword.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling his eyes on her, Haley glanced up , and the intensity of his gaze overpowered her. His eyes pierced her. Incinerated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did MacColla think of her? Did he believe her or think her insane?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away quickly. Strangely nervous, she returned her attention to the weapon, searching for some clue to the heart of the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smoothed her fingers along the guard, an unadorned span of steel in the shape of a 7, directly over the hilt, meant to protect the bearer\u0027s hand. Thin nicks in the metal scratched her thumb, and she contemplate d those strikes from other swords that had not found his flesh. She realized she was grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer finger traced down the leather grip. It was a ring-hilt, with a plain circle at the base of the pommel. Either an Irish-made sword, or with a nod to one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fisted her hand tight around it. The leather was smooth, from sweat and blood and use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley lifted. The tip remained on the ground, but still she felt the sword\u0027s heft. It would be only seven, perhaps eight pounds. Not too much heavier than the five -pound weights she\u0027d sometimes worked with at the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted the blade from the dirt. It was difficult. Eight pounds might not be much, but stretch it into a six-foot-long sword and it was a different story. She let the tip fall to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your early biographers wrote that you could behead four men with a single swing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha!” He gave a resounding laugh, and the sound of it was a balm to her nerves. “Is that so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged innocently, a smile on her face now, and he scooted next to her to clap his arm about her shoulder and tuck her in close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I suppose if the men were all of a height,” he speculated for a moment, sounding highly amused. “And if they all stood very still for me, back to stomach. Then, aye, I could do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, a wave of affection for him swept her. His suddenly high spirits were irresistible. And his accent melted her. His words had come out as “verrra still,” the thick brogue tripping his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her own arm around his back, leaned close and found herself inhaling quickly for a renegade hit of his scent. Musk and man. Closing her eyes, she shook her head at her animal response. An explosion of warmth in her belly, her body suddenly expectant, all her muscles tensed, piqued, and on alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid his laughter mean he believed her? Could he believe she was from another time? She hoped desperately he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can\u0027t tarry long, leannan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. Her body ached from walking. From not sleeping. Not eating. She\u0027d been taken in the night and her feet we re still bare, scratched and sore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading her thoughts, he said, “I see your weariness, and I\u0027m sorry for it. But there\u0027s nothing to be done. We\u0027re still on Campbell land. Though some of his people rally quietly against him, we\u0027ve no way to tell friend from foe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tangled his hand in her hair, pulled her close to kiss thetop of her head. “We need to keep walking. Find horses and be away from here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How will we find horses?” She gestured to the grand wilderness around them. They\u0027d traveled steadily south, as much as possible taking cover in the wooded tangles that shadowed Loch Awe. She didn\u0027t imagine they\u0027d be running into a stable anytime soon. “We\u0027re out in the middle of nowhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t fash your bonny head over it.” He pulled her in for one last, rough hug to his side. “I\u0027ve spent the better part of the season raiding this very land. I expect I\u0027ll be able to root out a pony for that sweet bottom of yours.” He slid his fingers down to give her a pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a little chirp of surprise. MacColla\u0027s grin was guileless and, Haley thought, if she didn\u0027t know better, she\u0027d think he was quite pleased with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, his features softening, brown eyes warm as they roved over her face, taking her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One more thing, leannan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe naked affection she saw in those eyes startled her. Thrilled her. Scared her. “Yes?” Her voice came out breathy and slight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-28.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
