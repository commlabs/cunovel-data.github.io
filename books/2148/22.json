{"id":96361,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday morning, I woke up without knowing what to do next. Ivy and Abby had insisted I join them and Nash at the mall. I couldn\u0027t convince Ivy that today wasn\u0027t good. Once she got something in her head, there was no changing her mind. There wasn\u0027t much daylight in the winter months and I didn\u0027t have much time, so I\u0027d have to make my visit with them quick in order to still have time to convince Brandon to go with me to Penny for Your Thoughts before the sun set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to take a quick stroll with Champ prior to heading out. It would give me a chance to get some fresh air and maybe some fresh ideas on how to convince Brandon to meet Dr. Meadows. As soon as we hit the end of our street, Champ was barking wildly. I did my best to calm him down, but all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking as we passed by their houses. Champ was growling toward the wooded area behind the snow-filled soccer field, and I began to wonder if I should be worried about wolves, even with Champ along with me. I started pulling him back toward home when \"Fly Me to the Moon\" started playing from my back pocket. I was exhilarated. It was Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m right behind you,\" he said when I answered the phone breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around. There was a figure standing next to the woods beyond the soccer field; it was the exact direction in which Champ was barking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried my best to hold on to Champ\u0027s leash but he broke loose. I chased after him down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Champ reached Brandon, my out-of-control dog was suddenly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout so much as a command or a treat, Champ sat down and faced Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a way with animals,\" I said when I finally caught up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And girls, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to kiss Brandon so badly my heart hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon petted Champ as if he were his own dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to take you out on a real date,\" Brandon said. \"But I know there are many complications with that. I mean, there\u0027s Nash, for one, and me being from the wrong side of town... and of course we\u0027d have to be back before sunset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m not dating Nash,\" I tried to assure him. \"And to me, any side of town you live on is the right side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled a sweet smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have listened to Dr. Meadows,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why you blame yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I hadn\u0027t been so skeptical of her prediction, none of this would have happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;there is no way you could have known. Besides, it\u0027s not like Dr. Meadows predicted the future. She said things that anyone could have said to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but it happened. Perhaps she really knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if she didn\u0027t? What if it was just coincidence? Or you read too much into her reading?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s the only one I know who can help you,\" I said wearily. \"She wants to see you. She says that is the only way she can help you. And if you don\u0027t go, then you might be a werewolf... forever.\" Tears began to well in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay...\" he said, putting his arm around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t even bear to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll meet her,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, if it will make you happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a huge hug. I didn\u0027t care whether the neighbors saw me do it, even though I knew we were hidden away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just take Champ home and I can drive us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going now?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping I\u0027d get to see you today\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for a real date. But it seems like you already have plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but I can see you later tonight.\" I realized I might have been too eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it occurred to me,\" he continued, \"since I can\u0027t remember the nights, I don\u0027t know how I am when the moon shows... I don\u0027t want you to be in any danger, so I thought I\u0027d just try to get a glimpse of you before sunset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t hurt me before when you\u0027ve been in your werewolf form,\" I said. \"And I\u0027ve seen you change twice. What makes you think you would harm me now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m like, Celeste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would love a real date with Brandon, but convincing him to be with me while in his werewolf form was another thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me be with you and I\u0027ll tell you tomorrow what you were like. I\u0027ll be able to reassure you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to see him again as a werewolf, with his magnetic features. And since he needed to know what he was like in his werewolf form, I could tell him. I\u0027d been waiting for months to have a real date with Brandon. Dr. Meadows had only been waiting for a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that Brandon was torn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bring Champ,\" I said. \"If that will make you feel better. He can protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against a werewolf?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think either one of us is in any danger. I know you don\u0027t remember, but I do. You could have hurt me last time\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I fell and you could have overpowered me, but you didn\u0027t. Instead it looked like you were going to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then,\" he relented. \"Will you meet me tonight?\" he asked. \"In the woods behind my house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded excitedly. It was official: our first real date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t remember,\" I said. \"But I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remember this,\" he said, and pulled me into an embrace and kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he left, Champ began barking again in the direction Brandon had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived at Brandon\u0027s hilltop hideout in the woods behind his grandparents\u0027 house, the scene was magical. Tiny snowflakes danced down from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was waiting for me next to a bonfire. He was as majestic and handsome as I\u0027d ever seen him. The fire crackled and lit his features. His dark hair was tousled and sexy. I walked up to him, and I could feel the heat radiating off his body as strongly as from the campfire. I was addicted to Brandon Maddox. He wasn\u0027t like anyone I\u0027d ever met. During the day, I found him to be a sensitive, caring guy\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;unlike all the guys I\u0027d ever hung out with\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and when the sun set and the full moon glowed, he was wild and irresistible. He had fangs that could pierce a girl\u0027s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChamp was silent at my side. It was as if he was as mesmerized by Brandon as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once the woods filled with the sounds of howling. Champ began to bark, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then I noticed the eyes of several wolves peeking from the dark edges of the clearing. Champ was still. Normally he would have lurched forward and I\u0027d have been thrown into the snow. Instead, all the animals were tranquil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was frozen with fear. Too recently, wolves had surrounded me and I feared for my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" Brandon assured me. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood behind him, and Champ did, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves, one by one, lay down in the pure white snow. The sight of the gorgeous gray wolves, which looked soft and sweet instead of fierce and dangerous, was unbelievably breathtaking. It was as magical as any footage I\u0027d seen on animal and nature programs\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;only this was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon happily petted the wolves, which were as playful as any domestic dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try this at home,\" he teased. \"But do you want to try it with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\" The wolves were amazingly beautiful. A smaller one came forward. Brandon nodded to me, and under his careful watch I suddenly felt safe. I reached out and gently touched the wolf pup. Its fur was soft and luxurious; I caressed the adorable wolf just as I had petted Champ for so many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt nuzzled up to me and licked my cheeks, causing me to burst out giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay now - \" Brandon said to the pup. \"Now you are getting on my territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistled, and the wolf retreated from me and returned to the pack. They all hunkered around Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon seemed more at peace than I\u0027d seen him since his arrival in Legend\u0027s Run. These wolves comforted him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;like Champ comforted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon took me in his arms. Normally, in a situation such as this one, I\u0027d be terrified. I was in the woods, surrounded by wolves, and in the company of a werewolf. But with Brandon, I felt at ease. I must have been under his spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must say, I\u0027ve never had a date like this one,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you don\u0027t remember,\" I said, \"you could be bringing cheerleaders back here every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise you that isn\u0027t happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a kiss on his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m starved,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the fire, where several steaks were cooking. I peered over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get these?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember...\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach turned. It couldn\u0027t be. A once-cute deer with Bambi\u0027s face now lying on this fire? I turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only kidding,\" he said. \"They\u0027re from my grandmother\u0027s freezer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed with relief. Brandon was such an animal lover he\u0027d be even more devastated than me if he discovered he\u0027d been hunting wildlife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat down together on a huge fallen tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged at the steaks with a stick as they sizzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around for a backpack or a picnic basket. \"Any plates? Forks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I forgot,\" he said. \"What was I thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon speared one of the steaks with a small branch and handed it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027m not a gentleman after all,\" he said, embarrassed, as I eyed the skewered meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer you in the wild,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tore into his steak as if he hadn\u0027t eaten in weeks. I wasn\u0027t used to camping\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;my experience with campfire dining was just bringing snacks from home like our sixsome had done this past fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the branch, the meat hanging on it. This was a lot different from roasting marshmallows. If Ivy could see me now, she\u0027d faint. Not only would I have to eat with my fingers, an activity that Ivy found revolting, but I didn\u0027t even have a napkin. I had mild trepidation, feeling like an animal myself. But I didn\u0027t want to offend Brandon, and I wasn\u0027t about to spoil our first date together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"We\u0027re really roughing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I felt uncomfortable eating in an unladylike way on a first date, there was a part of me that felt free. All these years I\u0027d played by the rules, and it was slightly liberating to eat in the wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to stop at a camping supply place after school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remind you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Brandon didn\u0027t remember this night together, maybe this was my chance to say things to him I wouldn\u0027t be able to say during the day. I could use this opportunity and finally confess my love to him. And in the morning, when I brushed past him at school, he wouldn\u0027t be aware that I\u0027d already bared the depths of my soul. However, Brandon did say he recalled certain images when he awoke. And with my luck, the one where I confessed my love and he laughed in my face would be that moment. So I nibbled on my steak as daintily as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon devoured his steak and threw the bone to his wolf pack. He took mine when I was done, then washed his hands off in a clump of snow. Brandon put his arms around me. He gave off as much heat as the crackling fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the best date I\u0027ve ever had,\" I said truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was enchanting. The snow had stopped falling, and now the clouds parted and the icicles glistened in the moonlight. Brandon warmed my hands in his. We watched as the wolves playfully bit each other and rolled around together in the snow. Then they yawned and stretched, and before I knew it, the wolves, along with Champ, were lying sound asleep. The trees were lined with snow, and I was in the company of a magnificent wild animal of the lycan kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe full moon shone above us. Brandon leaned into me and rested his stubbled cheek against mine. I wanted so badly to kiss him, but I recalled Dr. Meadows\u0027s words. I couldn\u0027t take the chance. For both our sakes I had to pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not supposed to kiss you when you\u0027re like this,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what if I kiss you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew me back and kissed my neck, then nibbled his way to my shoulders. He nuzzled his nose along my neckline. He touched my hair and breathed it in as if the scent placed him under a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the rest of the evening trying to avoid kissing a werewolf. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-22.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
