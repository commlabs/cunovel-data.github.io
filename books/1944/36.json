Justine had been seeing a much older man, and she\u0027d felt defensive and angry at the world. Olivia had wanted so much more for her. She knew that, in some ways, Justine was still grieving over the death of her twin—Jordan had died in a tragic accident at the age of 13. But Justine had finally come to a more peaceful acceptance. Olivia felt that was because of Seth. In fact, everything had changed when Justine fell in love with Seth Gunderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Jack?\" Justine asked, looking past Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The office, where else?\" Jack worked far too many hours, but nothing Olivia said convinced him to delegate some of his tasks. He was involved in every aspect of the newspaper and loved his job. Now that the Chronicle had gone to five editions a week, his hours were even worse than they\u0027d been before their marriage. They\u0027d argued about it repeatedly, but Olivia supposed she might as well get used to having a part-time husband. Jack had promised this wouldn\u0027t last much longer, but she suspected nothing was going to change until he retired. If then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine seated her at a window table, then returned to the front of the restaurant and talked to one of the waitresses. It was still early in the evening and the restaurant was only about a third full. As soon as she had someone to cover for her, she walked back to Olivia\u0027s table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got a moment?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Grace wouldn\u0027t arrive for at least ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter pulled out the chair across from her. \"How are things with Grandma?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia sighed and wondered how much of the story her daughter knew. Probably all of it. \"We\u0027re talking again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine smiled, obviously relieved. \"Grandma\u0027s going to marry Ben, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was well aware of that. \"She sent me a letter.\" It hurt that her own mother had written instead of telling her face-to-face. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt her,\" she admitted. \"Will and I had Ben investigated for her own protection, but our concern backfired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" At least Justine sounded sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom was upset about our lack of faith in her,\" Olivia said. She must have known instinctively how her mother would feel, because she\u0027d found it necessary to hide their inquiries from Charlotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did she say in her letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said everyone deserves to be happy, regardless of age, and reminded me how pleased she was when I married Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s right, you know,\" Justine murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she is.\" Olivia had no disagreement with that. \"She wants Will and me to treat Ben fairly and with respect. The same goes for his sons, of course.\" She frowned. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s met them, though, at least not yet.\" With a quick shrug, she added, \"Naturally I intend to respect Mom\u0027s wishes. It\u0027s been a bit difficult, thinking of my mother with another man, but it\u0027s her life and I want her to be happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine agreed. \"I never said anything when you decided to marry Jack,\" her daughter said softly. \"But deep down, I wanted you and Dad to get back together. I knew it would never work, but the little-girl part of me wanted my parents to love each other again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was shocked to see tears in her daughter\u0027s eyes. Justine blinked furiously, as though embarrassed. \"I still think about Jordan,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine nodded. \"Do you remember what day it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia realized with a jolt that she\u0027d been so preoccupied with what was happening in her own life she\u0027d let the date slip. On this day, August tenth, eighteen years ago, her son had drowned. Her entire life and those of her two surviving children had been divided by that date. The time before Jordan\u0027s death and the time after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping the tears from her face, Justine forced a smile. \"I didn\u0027t mean to get all maudlin. Let\u0027s get back to Grandma, before we both dissolve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia agreed and swallowed past the lump in her throat. \"I stopped at Mom\u0027s house earlier in the week and we hugged for the first time since she found out, and she forgave me. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll tell you herself, but they\u0027ve set the date for their wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine grinned sheepishly. \"I know all about that. Grandma came in earlier today and booked the restaurant for the reception. She talked to Uncle Will, and he said he\u0027s coming out for the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was glad to know that, because she wanted to give Grace ample warning. When Will arrived, Olivia planned to have a long talk with her brother about his Internet relationship with her best friend. He\u0027d taken advantage of Grace and betrayed his wife, Georgia. Olivia was furious whenever she thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, you two,\" Grace said, coming toward them. \"Am I interrupting anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" Justine said, rising gracefully from the chair. \"I was keeping Mom company until you got here.\" She looked at Olivia, winked and was on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny how just a few minutes with her daughter could mean so much. Olivia felt close to Justine and to her son James, too, and considered herself fortunate to have such wonderful children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry I\u0027m late,\" Grace said as she sat down across from Olivia. \"It took forever to finish up at the library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. Justine and I had a chance to talk and we don\u0027t get to do that nearly often enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how she feels,\" Grace muttered. \"You and I have barely any time together these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Olivia told her friend, and she was sincere. She had been neglecting their friendship, but was determined not to let that continue. \"How\u0027s your week been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace shrugged noncommitally. \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia smiled. \"The same. Jack and I are still adjusting to living together, which hasn\u0027t been as easy as I\u0027d hoped, but you know most of that.\" She\u0027d complained often enough during their aerobic workouts on Wednesday nights. \"Mom and I are talking now and she\u0027s forgiven me. Oh, and before I forget, Will\u0027s coming out for the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace paled visibly but didn\u0027t comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, what\u0027s new with you?\" Olivia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise, Grace grabbed a tissue from her purse. \"I have something to tell you, but I\u0027ll probably cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was aghast. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last week I got a letter from Mike Sherman, Dan\u0027s cousin in Oregon.\" She paused a moment to collect herself before continuing. \"He wrote after Dan\u0027s death and we\u0027ve talked a couple of times since, but this came out of the blue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nervously folded the edges of the linen napkin. \"Mike really feels bad about this, but he thought it was time I knew that Dan borrowed thirteen thousand dollars from him. Apparently he asked for the loan a year or so before he vanished. Mike didn\u0027t want to say anything after Dan disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no—he wants the money back now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded. \"He hated to ask, but he provided the paperwork and sure enough, that\u0027s Dan\u0027s signature on the promissory note. Mike said it\u0027s been over four years and he needs the money. He seems to think I got some life insurance settlement after Dan\u0027s body was discovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia knew she hadn\u0027t. Her opinion of Grace\u0027s dead husband had never been high but she considered the fact that he\u0027d burdened Grace with this loan unforgivable. Especially since Dan had to know that Grace wouldn\u0027t be able to collect on his life insurance if he committed suicide. Furthermore, the trailer he\u0027d purchased with that money—the trailer he\u0027d killed himself in—was a total loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace wadded the tissue in her hand. \"What else can I do? I\u0027m refinancing the house and paying him back the money, plus interest. It isn\u0027t Mike\u0027s fault that Dan chose to end his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to tell him you didn\u0027t get any insurance money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She shook her head. \"It would only make him feel worse about asking for the money back, and he doesn\u0027t deserve that. Frankly I\u0027m grateful he waited as long as he did. If he\u0027d hit me with this any sooner, I don\u0027t know how I would\u0027ve dealt with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that going to do to your finances?\" Olivia knew things were already tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll survive. I\u0027ve made it through worse times than this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Did you tell Sheriff Davis and Roy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roy said it was another piece of the puzzle falling into place,\" Grace told her. \"He was the one who originally found out about the trailer. We always wondered where Dan got the money...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was proud of Grace for taking this latest blow in stride and refusing to let circumstances overwhelm her. She was about to say that when Grace changed the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On a brighter note,\" she said with a big smile, \"I heard from Cliff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" Olivia knew her friend had made a concerted effort to win back the rancher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace almost squirmed in her chair with excitement. \"I have to tell you I\u0027d nearly given up hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia leaned toward her. \"Well, don\u0027t keep me in suspense. Tell me what happened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I drove out to his ranch with a batch of chocolate chip cookies ten days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia nodded approvingly. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to weep with frustration when he wasn\u0027t home, but I talked to Cal and he was so encouraging. I like him a lot. He said he\u0027d make sure Cliff knew I\u0027d stopped by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like Cal, too.\" Olivia had only met the trainer once and briefly, but she\u0027d taken an instant liking to him. Although he was quiet, even solemn, she sensed a deep reserve of strength and character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Cliff call you?\" Olivia leaned closer, eager to hear the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...actually I haven\u0027t talked to him yet.\" But Grace showed no sign of being discouraged. \"I received an e-mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress stepped up to the table, and Olivia realized they\u0027d been so intent on their conversation they hadn\u0027t given any thought to food or drink. The young woman took their order for wine spritzers and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Olivia pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cliff thanked me for the cookies. He was very polite and he didn\u0027t write anything else, but Olivia, I feel like there\u0027s a crack in this wall he\u0027s erected between us. He can\u0027t ignore me anymore. I won\u0027t let him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not fooling myself. I have a long way to go, but that one message cheered me so much I\u0027ve been walking on air ever since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you sent him other messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded. \"Every evening. I mail a card twice a week but Cal told me Cliff\u0027s started collecting the mail himself. When I don\u0027t send a card, I write an e-mail. He hasn\u0027t blocked my name, so I know he\u0027s getting those messages, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia reached for her menu. For the first time in months, she had the feeling that everything was going to work out between Grace and Cliff Harding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen tucked the latest photograph of Katie into a business-size envelope, along with a short note to Jon\u0027s parents. She left it unaddressed and slipped the envelope in with the rest of the mail she planned to drop off at the post office Monday morning. She\u0027d fill in the necessary information later rather than risk having Jon find an envelope with his parents\u0027 address. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-36.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
