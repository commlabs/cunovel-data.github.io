She hadn\u0027t moved all the while he\u0027d been making a racket in the bathroom. He picked up the laptop and noticed what was on the screen. There were three names with a little information about each, and he could tell she had been doing a search for Will\u0027s friends. He was surprised Will had any friends at all. He read the names again so he could check them out, then closed the laptop and put it on the dresser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was exhausted. There were deep circles under her eyes. And no wonder. She\u0027d been putting in such long hours at the office with no end in sight. He pulled the covers back and tucked her in. She needed the rest. He didn\u0027t trust himself to sleep in her bed again, so he grabbed a pillow with the intent of sleeping on the sofa. He made it to the bedroom door before he stopped, turned around, and went back to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to be out of my mind, he thought, being so close to her. After moving the covers out of the way, he stretched out as far away from her as possible. Fifteen minutes later, he was finally drifting off to sleep when Allison rolled over and snuggled up against him. Her warm body pressed to his was driving him crazy. He wanted nothing more than to have her wake up and reach for him, but that was being selfish. She was exhausted, he reminded himself. He was not going to have sex with her. He repeated the declaration a good five times to fortify his resolve, but it didn\u0027t make his struggle any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah, he was definitely out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison had several ideas where Will might be hiding. She remembered the names of a few of the low-life degenerates he had hung out with in high school. Three in particular stuck in her mind. They were always in trouble with the law. When they had been around, she had hidden in her room. She wasn\u0027t sure if Will still kept in touch with any of them, but finding out was worth a try. They were all long shots. Getting Liam to cooperate without calling in the troops was going to be tricky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam was carrying his gym bag to the door when she walked out of the bedroom. \"Going somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dressed for the day in a short skirt and a T-shirt with an image of Tweety Bird on the front. Liam had to take the time to appreciate her long legs and promptly lost his train of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\" He quickly recovered. \"Yes, I have to leave. However, there will be-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe interrupted. \"How about you take me out to breakfast first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just ate breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then how about taking a drive before you leave? It\u0027s a beautiful day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her. \"Want to tell me what you\u0027re up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" She made the lie blacker by adding, \"Honest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison could see in his eyes that he knew she was lying. She smiled sweetly and said, \"I\u0027ll be happy to drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this drive have anything to do with your search on your laptop last night?\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shocked. \"You looked at my screen? That\u0027s private . . . That\u0027s . . .\" She stopped when she realized she was sputtering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did look. The screen was open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh . . . okay, then. Should I drive or do you want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive. Will I need my gun on this scenic drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always wear a gun. I\u0027m assuming you\u0027ll do so today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I gonna have to shoot someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope not.\" She walked past him and reached for the door. \"Are you coming with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ve got a little time before my replacement arrives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What replacement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do I need an agent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To go over the rules,\" he explained patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What rules?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached around her, pulled the door open, and waited for her to move. \"Are we going or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, she put her hands on her hips and said, \"What rules?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rules in place until we catch Will and know that Bale has come to his senses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think I\u0027m in danger from either one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just follow the rules,\" he reiterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison figured she could go to Phillips for answers, but then realized that wouldn\u0027t get her anywhere. He liked to lecture and wasn\u0027t one to share information. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed Liam to the elevator. He was putting her in a mood, she decided. It was odd that he hadn\u0027t asked her where she wanted to go on their drive. She didn\u0027t think Liam liked surprises in his line of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. Liam didn\u0027t like surprises, and he would have forced Allison to tell him exactly what her destination was if he didn\u0027t already know. She\u0027d had three names on her computer screen, and he ran all of them. One had joined the army and was overseas-he\u0027d obviously turned his life around before it spun out of control. The second was doing hard time for an armed robbery. And the third was living in LA with his sister and her husband. He was currently trying to get disability for a bogus back injury. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-85.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
