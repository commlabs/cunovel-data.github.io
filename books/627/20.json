In fact, she thinks you are the stupidest person she doesn\u0027t know. What do you think of that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She also thinks you\u0027re ugly! As a matter of fact, she thinks you are the ugliest person she doesn\u0027t know. And she doesn\u0027t know a lot of people.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She doesn\u0027t like the people she knows, either. She hates everybody in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. She did like one member of the class. She liked Sammy. She thought he was funny. Sammy was a dead rat.\n\u003cbr\u003e 76But Kathy has good reasons for not liking any of the children she knows. She doesn\u0027t like D.J. because he smiles too much, and she doesn\u0027t like John because he can\u0027t stand on his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy once had a cat named Skunks. She liked Skunks. But she was afraid that Skunks would run away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have nothing to worry about, Kathy,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Skunks won\u0027t run away. Just be nice to him and feed him and pet him, and he won\u0027t run away. He may go out and play, but he\u0027ll always come back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, you\u0027re wrong, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Kathy. \"What do you know! He\u0027ll run away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Kathy kept Skunks locked up in her closet at home. She never let him out and sometimes even forgot to feed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One day, while Kathy was looking for her other shoe, Skunks ran out of the closet and never came back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You said he would come back, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Kathy. \"He never came back. You were wrong. I was right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was why Kathy didn\u0027t like Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The next time I get a cat, I\u0027ll kill him. Then he\u0027ll never run away,\" said Kathy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then there was the time that Dameon tried to teach Kathy how to play catch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dameon said, \"When I throw you the ball, Kathy, try to catch it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t catch it,\" said Kathy. \"I\u0027ll just get hurt.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You won\u0027t get hurt,\" Dameon insisted. \"Just watch the ball.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He tossed it to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e 77But Kathy knew she\u0027d get hurt. So she closed her eyes. The ball hit her on the cheek. It hurt.\n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy began to cry. \"You were wrong,\" she sobbed. \"I was right!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was why Kathy didn\u0027t like Dameon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison believed that if you are nice to someone, then they\u0027ll be nice to you. So one day she brought Kathy a cookie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t want your ugly cookie,\" said Kathy. \"It probably tastes terrible!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison said, \"No, it is very good. I made it myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy said, \"If you made it, then it must stink! You can\u0027t cook. You\u0027re too stupid!\" She just put the cookie in her desk along with her pencils, crayons, and books.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three weeks later, Kathy was hungry. \"All right, Allison,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll try your stupid cookie.\" She took it out of her desk. It was covered with dust. She bit it. It was hard and tasted terrible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"See,\" said Kathy. \"I was right!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was why Kathy didn\u0027t like Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, Kathy had very good reasons for not liking anybody she knew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But she also has a good reason for not liking you. And she doesn\u0027t even know you. Her reason is this. She knows that if you ever met her, you wouldn\u0027t like her. You don\u0027t like Kathy, do you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e See, she was right!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s funny how a person can be right all the time and still be wrong.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56826.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
