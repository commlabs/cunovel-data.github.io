{"id":29564,"no":34,"title":"XXXIV. “AZOR! AZOR!”","content":"When school was over I made up my mind that I would slip quietly out of the college gates, and making my escape, run home as fast as my legs could carry me. Unfortunately I did not succeed in doing this. In the playground I had to pass several boys who were collected together in groups before they went home. I blush to acknowledge that one of these boys—quite a little fellow too—planted himself resolutely in front of me and prevented me from passing him. After standing so for a second he suddenly seized me by the nose and pulled it till I cried out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Knock him down, he has insulted you,” cried out a boy noted for his love of fighting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I looked at him, feeling stupid and uncertain what to do: he turned away in disgust, shrugging his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I succeeded, however, in making my way out of college. To my great astonishment all the boys whom I passed, whether of my own class or not, seemed determined to call me “Azor.” “Here, here, Azor,” they cried. “Hi, hi, Azor, where is that dog Azor? Oh, here he is, and muzzled! He does not bite, not he. Get out, Azor!” These were the cries that greeted me on every side. Why should they call me by that name, which in France is commonly given to a dog only?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here and there, in Pont-street, stood groups of college boys: as soon as I passed one of these clusters, the boys all burst out laughing and called after me, “Azor! Azor!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Confused and frightened, I ran past houses and people and soon got ahead of the most advanced of the college boys. When I got in front of the Hospital, I saw two old men breathing a little fresh air at the door; as I passed them, one gave the other a slap on the back and cried out, “Hullo, look at Azor!” and I heard them bursting out into peals of laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the corner of one of the streets I had to pass by, there was a large grocer’s shop; one of the shop-boys was standing close to the pavement grinding coffee. As soon as I passed, the coffee-mill stopped and I heard the boy calling to the others, inside the shop, to come and look at “Azor!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “HULLO, LOOK AT AZOR!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The work people, coming out of the manufactory to their dinners, began to bark at me, and hiss as if they were setting two dogs to fight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last, to my joy, I saw our house: I was safe! But no, not yet: my hands trembled so that I could not turn the handle of the door: my nervous stamping attracted the attention of a painter who was painting a signboard in front of a restaurant near. The moment he saw me, he left off whistling a popular air, and, coming towards me, held his paint-brush horizontally about two feet from the ground, and promised “Azor, good Azor,” a piece of sugar if he would jump over it nicely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I rushed into the house and threw myself upon a chair, panting for breath.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1958/56181.html","bookId":746,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:40:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:40:01 AM"}
