But really, what else could she say? Her unexpected attraction to this man had completely overwhelmed her. She could only hope it passed quickly. How could she be devastated by her breakup with Brad and at the same time, experience all the symptoms of extreme attraction toward another man? A man she’d met for about five minutes and been determined to dislike on sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s really cute, too.” Jazmine seemed to feel obliged to remind her of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if Shana needed a reminder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is, isn’t he?” Jazmine challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, he’s cute.” The words nearly stuck in her throat, but with no small effort, Shana managed to get them out. She didn’t know why Jazmine was so insistent. The girl seemed to think she had a point to prove, and she wasn’t letting up until she got Shana to confess she was interested in Adam Kennedy. She wasn’t, of course. Okay, she was, but that was as far as it went. In other words, if he asked her out, which he wouldn’t, she’d refuse. Well, she might consider it briefly, but the answer would still be no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine was suspiciously quiet for several minutes and then gave a soft laugh. “I bet you’re hot on him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Shana nearly swallowed her tongue. The last thing she needed was Jazmine telling Adam this. “No way,” she denied vehemently. She could only pray that wasn’t what Jazz had said to Adam in the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne glance told her Jazmine didn’t buy her denial. She shouldn’t have bothered to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re saying that because of your old boyfriend, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely not,” Shana protested. She stepped hard on the brake at a stop sign she’d almost missed, jerking them both forward. Thank goodness for seat belts. Glaring at her niece, she asked, “Who told you that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine blinked wide eyes at Shana. “I overheard my mom talking to you. I wasn’t listening in on your conversation, either, if that’s what you’re thinking. I tried to find out from Mom, but all she’d tell me was that your heart was broken, and that’s why you moved to Seattle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana was too tired to argue and too emotionally drained to be upset with her sister. If Ali had told Jazmine about Brad, then it was because she felt Jazmine needed to know. “I’m completely over Brad. I’m so over him it’s hard to remember why I even got involved with him.” The words had begun to sound like a worn-out litany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brad,” Jazmine said, and seemed satisfied now that she knew his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana struggled to hide her reaction. Even the mention of Brad’s name irritated her. She might have worked the last twelve hours straight, and on her feet at that, but she had enough energy left to maintain her outrage toward Brad. Still, she would’ve preferred never to talk about him—or hear about him—ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still have a heart, though,” Jazmine pressed. “Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I have a heart.” Shana didn’t know where this was leading and she didn’t care, as long as it didn’t end up on the subject of Adam Kennedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s why you’re so hot on my uncle Adam.” Darn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not hot on your uncle Adam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jazmine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer niece laughed and despite her irritation, Shana smiled. This was not a conversation she wanted to have, but she’d walked right into it and was determined to extricate herself as gracefully as possible. “Don’t get me wrong,” she said in conciliatory tones. “I think he’s a very nice man, but I don’t want to get involved with anyone at the moment. Understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine bit her lower lip, as if she wanted to argue, but apparently changed her mind. “For how long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana decided to nip this question in the bud. “Forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That long?” Jazmine threw her a crushed look. “You don’t want children? That means I’ll never have cousins!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, months and months, then.” At this point Shana was ready to agree to just about anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Months,” Jazmine repeated. She seemed to accept that—or at any rate ventured no further argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana parked in front of her house, grateful to be home. “You know what? I don’t want to cook. Do you have any suggestions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can open a can of chili,” Jazmine said. “I’m not very hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana wasn’t all that hungry, either. “Sounds like a perfectly good dinner to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me do it, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Jazz.” Shana had no intention of turning down this generous offer. “Fabulous.” Then considering her role as guardian, she felt obliged to ask, “Do you have any homework?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow came the dilemma. A really good substitute mother would tell Jazmine to forget dinner; Shana would rustle up a decent meal while the kid did her schoolwork. A woman of character would insist on opening that can of chili herself. But not one with tired feet and the start of a throbbing headache, brought on by all this talk about Adam Kennedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside the house, Shana left the front door open to create a cooling breeze. She lay back on the sofa and elevated her feet. It was little wonder the Olsens had been ready to sell their restaurant. This was hard work. For part of each day, Shana had her face buried in three-gallon containers of ice cream. Her nose felt like she was suffering from permanent frostbite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine immediately went into the kitchen and started shuffling pans, clanking one against the other. “Do you need any help?” Shana felt she had to ask, but the question was halfhearted, to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is really very sweet of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine grumbled a reply and Shana realized she’d failed again. A kid like Jazmine, who wore ankle-high tennis shoes to school, didn’t take kindly to the word sweet. Sooner or later, Shana would need to develop a more appropriate vocabulary. Later, she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good ten minutes passed and if not for the sounds coming from the kitchen, Shana would be napping by now. Her head rested against the cushion, her feet were propped up and all was well. For the first time since she’d arrived, Jazmine was talking freely with her. She wasn’t sure whether she should credit Adam Kennedy with this improvement or not. She’d rather think she was making strides in her relationship with her niece due to her own efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Adam says you need a man in your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer peace shattered, and Shana’s eyes sprang open. She sat up, swung around and dropped her feet to the floor. “What did you just say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine appeared in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room, wearing a chagrined expression. “I…Uncle Adam said you’re the kind of woman who needs a man in her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did it. She’d utterly humiliated herself in front of him, and he thought…he assumed she was making some kind of play for him. This was the worst possible scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shana?” Jazmine whispered. “You look mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered if the smoke coming out of her ears was any indication. “That’s ludicrous!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m pretty sure he meant it as a compliment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana doubted it, but gave her niece credit for some fast backtracking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He thinks you’re beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did? Although it shouldn’t have mattered, his comment gave Shana pause. “He said that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine hesitated. “Well, not exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, then. “Listen, it’s not a good idea for us to talk about your uncle Adam right now.” When she saw him next, she’d have plenty to say, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t want to talk about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” The kid was catching on fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t want to talk about Brad, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight again. “You could say men aren’t my favorite topic at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess not,” Jazmine said pensively. “I won’t mention either of them if that’s what you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want.” Her serenity gone, Shana gave up the idea of resting and joined Jazmine in the kitchen. Her niece’s backpack was propped against the kitchen chair; she seemed to keep it close at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her intentions to the contrary, Shana gave the sexy lieutenant commander plenty of thought. What she had to do was keep her distance. She would be polite and accommodating if he wanted to spend time with Jazmine, but other than that, she’d be cool and remote. Never again would she allow him the opportunity to suggest that she needed a man—least of all him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine stirred the chili with her back to Shana. “I probably shouldn’t have said anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about it.” Shana was eager to drop the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not mad, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not anymore,” Shana assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both broke out laughing. Obviously Jazz remembered that this childish interchange had amused her earlier, and she wasn’t above repeating it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana had to admit it felt good to laugh with her niece; it was almost like having her sister there. Jazmine was a petite version of Ali and after she’d lowered her guard, they got along well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana wondered if she should clarify her position in case Adam asked Jazmine about her again or made some other ridiculous statement. No, she decided. She’d enlighten him herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know you’re not getting any younger,” Jazmine said out of the blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Shana got over her shock, she had to acknowledge that the kid was ruthless in achieving her goals. She went directly for the jugular. But Shana kept her response light. “After a day like this one, that’s certainly true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday morning, Jazmine agreed to come down to the ice-cream parlor with her. In fact, Shana had no choice but to bring her. Catherine, her employee, wouldn’t be in until that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point Catherine was only part-time, but with the summer traffic, business was picking up and she’d need a second part-time employee. As the season progressed and the parlor was open later in the evening, she’d add more staff. The Olsens had told her that her biggest expense would be the staff payroll and warned her not to hire more people than she needed. Shana had taken their words to heart, doing as much as she could herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I bring my Rollerblades?” Jazmine asked, standing in the doorway of her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” Shana hated the thought of Jazmine hanging around the restaurant all day with nothing to do. Since Lincoln Park was directly across the street, there’d be plenty of paved sidewalks for her to skate. It would be a good opportunity to meet other girls her age, too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-husband-navy-6/page-9.html","bookId":1961,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:21 AM"}
