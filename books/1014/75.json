Also, I thought it well that thy expectation of seeing thy husband should be diffused over two days, so that the disappointment might be lessened, if it were impossible for me to come on the very day appointed. But these reasons are of no moment, since thou so earnestly desirest to know the day and hour. Unless the sky fall, belovedest, I will come tomorrow. I know of no obstacle; and if there were a million, it would be no matter. When once we are together, 39 our own world is round about us, and all things else cease to exist.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Belovedest, thy letter of a week from Thursday reached me not till Tuesday!
