New York looked its most beautiful in the spring sunshine, as vibrant and alive as she had ever known it. The streets were thronged with people, rushing about the business of life as if it mattered. It was at once familiar and strange, like walking through a dream that she had had many times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was alive. She was free. Grace understood that these things were supposed to make her happy. She wondered if they ever would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back over her shoulder at the hospital, she thought fondly of Mitch Connors. Mitch was a good man. A kind man. Grace had sensed that from the beginning. In another life, a different dream, I could have loved him. But that chance had passed, blown away like a feather in the wind. She knew she would never go back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she really go abroad? Probably. Or perhaps she would simply fade away here, as she had before, disappear into the comforting anonymity of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning the corner, Grace Brookstein walked toward the subway. The crowds on the sidewalk opened up to let her in, then closed around her like a womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eACKNOWLEDGMENTS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY SINCERE THANKS ARE DUE ONCE again to the Sheldon family for their trust in me, their support and generosity.
