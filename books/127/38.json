It was a good idea. It still is.\n\u003cbr\u003e The only trifling flaw\u0026nbsp; about it is that it is impossible.

High moral standards and all that. There\u0027snothing to complain about from that viewpoint.

He\u0027san absolute monarch by divine right, and the people believe it, thoroughly,and the priests, too.\u0026nbsp; You can\u0027t overthrow a king like that. Now do you getthe point?\"\"Hold\u0026nbsp; on,\" said Walto,\u0026nbsp; at this point.\u0026nbsp; \"What did\u0026nbsp; you mean when\u0026nbsp; you saidHardin\u0027s done all this?

He can movefrom\u0026nbsp; place to\u0026nbsp; place\u0026nbsp; through the\u0026nbsp; air at\u0026nbsp; crucial moments,\u0026nbsp; supposedly byinspiration of\u0026nbsp; divine spirit. He fills the\u0026nbsp; temple with a pearly, internallight at\u0026nbsp; a gesture.

Take the situation thirty years ago,when\u0026nbsp; Hardin\u0026nbsp; saved\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; Foundation from\u0026nbsp; Anacreon\u0026nbsp; ? At\u0026nbsp; that time,\u0026nbsp; theAnacreonian people\u0026nbsp; had no real conception of the\u0026nbsp; fact that the Empire wasrunning down.\u0026nbsp; They had been more\u0026nbsp; or less running their\u0026nbsp; own affairs sincethe Zeonian\u0026nbsp; revolt, but even after\u0026nbsp; communications broke down and Lepold\u0027spirate of\u0026nbsp; a grandfather made\u0026nbsp; himself king, they never\u0026nbsp; quite realized theEmpire had gone kaput.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"If the\u0026nbsp; Emperor had had the\u0026nbsp; nerve to try, he\u0026nbsp; could have taken over againwith two cruisers and\u0026nbsp; with the help of the internal revolt that would havecertainly\u0026nbsp; sprung to\u0026nbsp; life. And\u0026nbsp; we we\u0026nbsp; could have\u0026nbsp; done the same;\u0026nbsp; but no,Hardin established monarch worship. Personally, I don\u0027t understand it. Why?\n\u003cbr\u003e Why? Why?\"\"What,\" demanded\u0026nbsp; Jaim Orsy,\u0026nbsp; suddenly, \"does Verisof\u0026nbsp; do?

Is\u0026nbsp; he blind,too?\"\"I don\u0027t\u0026nbsp; know,\" said Bort, curtly. \"He\u0027s high priest to\u0026nbsp; them.

Figurehead, blast him, figurehead!\"There was silence all\u0026nbsp; round and all eyes turned to Sermak. The young partyleader was\u0026nbsp; biting a fingernail nervously, and\u0026nbsp; then said loudly, \"No good.\n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s fishy!\"He looked around him,\u0026nbsp; and added more energetically, \"Is Hardin then such afool?\"\"Seems to be,\" shrugged Bort.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never! There\u0027s\u0026nbsp; something wrong.

On the\u0026nbsp; one hand, toestablish a\u0026nbsp; religion that would wipe out\u0026nbsp; all chance of internal troubles.\n\u003cbr\u003e On the other hand, to arm Anacreon with all weapons of warfare.
