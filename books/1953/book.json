Rachel’s pregnant, and she says that she can’t handle the stress in our household anymore. My thirteen-year-old daughter, Jolene, is jealous of her. Maybe it’s my fault. As a widower I spoiled her – Jolene was reading over my shoulder just now and says that’s not true. She claims Rachel ruined everything. But that’s not true. The real question is: How can I get my wife back? I don’t even know where she is. She’s not with Teri Polgar or any of her other friends from the salon. The other question is. . . when will Jolene grow up and stop acting like such a brat? Of course, I’m not the only one in town with problems. Linc Wyse’s father-in-law is trying to destroy his business. And you know Charlotte Rhodes? Seems she’s becoming forgetful, and the family’s worried about her and Ben. Lots of other stuff going on – but Rachel is better at keeping up with it than I am. If you have any idea where my wife is, please give me a call. Please. —Bruce Peyton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/1105-yakima-street-cedar-cove-11.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/1105-yakima-street-cedar-cove-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:02 AM"}
