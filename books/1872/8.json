The assortment of rich colors stood out against the white comforter, making it difficult which to choose. She checked the alarm clock on the nightstand and cringed. Dean would be here in half an hour and she wasn\u0027t even close to being ready. She stood there naked, examining her new undergarments while chewing on a pinky. The smell of the lasagna made her mouth water and she hoped he would like it. If not, they could jump right to dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally decided that lavender was the winner and hurriedly clipped the tags. After slipping into them, she checked herself in a full length mirror leaning against a bedroom wall. She smiled in approval and turned back to the cramped walk-in closet, shoving hangers back for an inch or two of space to view her choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God,\" she muttered, pulling out a heather gray dress with a price tag hanging from the sleeve. \"I forgot all about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smoke alarm went off, filling the apartment with an earsplitting protest that drowned out the iPod dock in the living room. She scurried into the hallway, her boobs bouncing inside her new bra, and pulled a step stool from a hall closet. The incessant beeping made her squint as she climbed up the stool. Evy disconnected the battery from the blaring smoke alarm like it might bite her, plunging the apartment back into a smoky instrumental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged the step stool back into the closet and padded her bare feet into the kitchen. The oven door pulled open with a creak, allowing smoke to escape from some cheese burning on the bottom, courtesy of a recent frozen pizza. The pan of lasagna bubbled and sizzled but had some time to go, so she shut the door and lit a candle before rushing back into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of the messy closet made her sigh. She rested her hands on her hips, not knowing where to even begin. They were staying in to watch movies tonight but she still wanted to look good for him. Not too good like she was trying too hard, but a casual good. In the end, she opted for skinny jeans and a black tank top that showed off her arms. She topped it off with the arrow necklace Dean had given her and a Michael Kors watch from Richie on her twenty-seventh birthday. The last birthday they would spend together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied herself in the mirror, thankful to have that man in the past and Dean in her future. It was weird how fate sometimes worked. Last year she couldn\u0027t understand why that had happened to her but looking back now, it all made sense. She imagined being married to Richie in Des Moines and shuddered at the thought. Just thinking about living without Dean made her heart ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack inside the closet, she scanned the rows of shoes, from high heeled boots and dress shoes to sandals and sneakers. She tapped a finger against her lips, deciding she needed to go shoe shopping soon, and settled for a pair of purple fuck me pumps. She slid on some bracelets and checked her completed ensemble in the mirror. Butterflies stirred in her gut and she took a steadying breath. Even after nearly two months, just knowing he was on the way made her pulse race. She dashed back into the closet and switched out the pumps for a pair of Steve Madden sandals with black jewels encrusted in their center and went back to the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her shoulders to her ears and decided it was time for a glass of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean crossed his arms over his chest and bit his tongue. The early evening sun baked against his neck, leaving dew-like drops of sweat springing from his forehead. An elderly couple squeezed past and went inside the grocery store where the air conditioning had to feel amazing. He shifted in his stance, watching a heavyset lady hold up the growing Redbox line behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanna do it! I wanna do it!\" the lady\u0027s little girl yelled, standing on her bare tip-toes and randomly pressing buttons on the Redbox screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then pick one and let\u0027s go!\" the mom ordered, fanning her oversized Tweety Bird shirt to let some heat escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid scrolled through screens at the speed of light and Dean rolled his eyes beneath his shades. After Megan\u0027s bombshell, even the most mundane tasks were now pure torture. He checked his watch again and mopped his brow with the back of his hand. He was late. Last night\u0027s ordeal with Megan had left him with dark circles and little patience. In the end, he decided Shaun was right. Telling Evy anything about Megan would be pointless until he found out the truth one way or the other. Unfortunately, after researching paternity tests online, he knew it was going to be a long four or five weeks ahead of him. Until then, he would just have to act like nothing was wrong around Evy, which would be an uphill battle to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be nice if they made reservations online like normal people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean turned to a lady behind him and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some people,\" she muttered, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean turned back around, wondering if Evy would be able to see Megan on his face. When he was seventeen he had successfully managed to hide a dent in the rear bumper of his dad\u0027s Oldsmobile for three whole days. When his parents finally noticed, they had been quick to write it off to some rude jerk at the grocery store or mall. But this was different. The stakes were much higher than a seven hundred dollar dent courtesy of a defiant telephone pole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis phone vibrated in his pocket. He pulled it out, knowing Evy was probably wondering where he was, their dinner already getting cold. His eyes dropped to the screen and he grimaced. Megan smiled at him with her bare boobs in her hands, holding them like hamsters. He felt the lady behind him peering over his shoulder and quickly slid the phone back into his pocket, making a mental note to destroy the evidence before leaving the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low hum, the Redbox finally spit out a DVD in slow motion. The little girl snatched it and her mom towed her into the parking lot by the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God,\" the lady mumbled behind Dean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean swiped his Visa and waited for the red machine to find his reservations, feeling the heat from the eyes and hot sun on his neck. At this rate, he was going to need another shower but there was no time. He swallowed dryly, wondering if he could pull it off. This was going to be much different than a seven hundred dollar dent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean stared at the brass plated number sixteen looking back at him on the door, his heart thumping in his chest. He exhaled out his mouth, kicking himself for not canceling. His first instinct to play sick and regroup had been correct as usual. He cringed for not listening to his gut and knocked softly, clutching the Blu-rays in a sweaty hand. His stomach churned and he cursed Megan for putting him between a rock and a hard place like this. Things were finally going great and destiny, for whatever reason, was hell-bent on changing that. He had been down that road before when his parents had died in that dented Oldsmobile and there was no way he was going down it again. He had lost enough people for one lifetime. He hadn\u0027t known Evy for long but the bond was there just the same. A bond he had never felt with another living soul his entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door cracked open and his heart skipped a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy pulled the door back, smiling warmly. \"Hi, handsome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside and planted a kiss on her lips because that\u0027s what he would do under normal circumstances. They pulled apart and he avoided her eyes, continuing into the living room where soft jazz oozed and candles burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said, closing the door and sashaying into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smells amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oven door opened with a groan and Evy peeked inside. \"About ten more minutes.\" She shut the door and went to the fridge. \"I hope you like lasagna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the DVDs on a weathered coffee table more fitting for a Cape Cod bungalow. \"Love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Momma\u0027s secret recipe,\" she smiled, handing him a cold beer. \"I hope you\u0027re hungry. It\u0027s a huge pan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced a smile. \"Starving,\" he lied, taking the cold bottle and plopping down on the couch with a tired moan bursting from his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her darkened flat screen. This was going to be harder than he thought. Maybe he could pretend he wasn\u0027t feeling well. Stomach ache or a fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head snapped around to her. \"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a seat next to him, careful not to spill her glass of cab as she folded one leg beneath her. \"Did you have a long day?\" she asked, fixing his windblown hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheels turned in his mind. He wondered if he looked like he had had a long day, and stretched his lips downward. \"It wasn\u0027t too bad.\" He took a long drink from his bottle, the cool liquid feeling good against his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" she said, resting her arm on the couch and rubbing his neck. \"Ewe, you\u0027re all sweaty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned and thought about feigning a fever. \"The Redbox line was insane, and right in the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy eyeballed the movies. \"So what\u0027d ya get?\" she asked, bending over and picking up the DVDs so he didn\u0027t have to answer. He suddenly felt like the best way to avoid the whole Megan topic was to do as little talking as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up one of the movies for him to see and pulled a wide grin across her face. \"I have been waiting to see this forever!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet,\" she laughed. \"Although, according to Jon, you do love yourself some chick flicks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the other movie from her hands. \"Actually, this is more my style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile fell. \"Oh no!\" she laughed. \"I\u0027ll be up all night hearing things if I watch that. I hate those Paranormal Activity movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn easy grin slid across his face in the soft light. \"Well, good thing you\u0027ll have some company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth got round with surprise. \"How\u0027d you know my other boyfriend was coming over later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and set the movies down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean cleared his throat and moved a decorative pillow out from under him. \"So how\u0027d it go with the plumber last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was fine. He just had to snake the drain with this huge coil thingy. Left a huge mess everywhere that, of course, they never clean up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate when that happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tipped her wine glass back, the smell of baked lasagna wafting through the air. Somebody tromped down the stairs out in the common hallway, cutting the silence between them. The steps faded into the night and the silence reconnected. The walls seemed to bulge with the tension filling the room. At least to Dean it was tension. To her, maybe it was nothing more than a comfortable silence two people sometimes shared without feeling the need to talk. He found her green eyes and couldn\u0027t stop himself from looking away to pick at the label on his bottle. She pulled her leg out from under her and resituated. He scrambled for something to say, something that wouldn\u0027t sound like anything was wrong. He sat up straighter, trying to find a more comfortable spot that was as elusive as peace of mind. Megan\u0027s words rang hollow in his ears. Black mascara bleeding down her face in muddy streams gripped his thoughts. Nothing would ever be comfortable again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart sank. She was on to him. He couldn\u0027t possibly face her now, but at some point he would have to turn and look into those majestic eyes again. But just not right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her eyes upon him, sending troubled signals straight to her brain. He inhaled a deep breath and forced himself to meet her vexed gaze. His Adam\u0027s apple bobbed one time while a vein throbbed in his neck. He wiped his palms on his jeans. \"I might have a situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy creased her brow. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and paced the modest living room like an expectant father, staring down at the carpet, his insides twisting into knots. Shooting pains stabbed at his heart like sharpened knives. This was the end of the line and there was no way to avoid barreling off the tracks. He had to tell her. But how? His mind raced. She didn\u0027t deserve this and neither did he. No one deserved to have everything they ever wanted dangled in front of them only to have it yanked away at the last second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dean? You\u0027re freaking me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped pacing and looked her right in the worried eye, dizzy from a shortness of breath he couldn\u0027t shake. \"I had an old girlfriend stop by last night after you left.\" He watched her face stiffen and it broke his heart. He swallowed thickly, wanting to run. \"She\u0027s pregnant.\" He waited for her to gasp out loud and slap a hand over her heart, signaling she was officially horrified beyond all recognition, but she didn\u0027t move. \"Allegedly,\" he threw in for good measure, leaving the tiniest of cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy stared at him with her mouth hanging open. \"Pregnant?\" she said faintly, the rosy color leaving her cheeks in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled a forlorn breath, his chest deflating as quickly as his hope. \"But it\u0027s not what you think. She was from before I ever laid eyes on you. That you have to know right now.\" He paused to catch his breath. \"After I saw you, I never saw anyone else again. Only you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe weighed his words with careful deliberation, her wine glass trembling in her hand. She set it down and crossed her arms. \"How long before me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his gaze to the carpet, unable to look into those eyes a second longer. Dean saw her kick him out of her life forever before it even happened. He would never see those green eyes again. \"A week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked silence was her reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, wanting to rewind to the night with Megan and just go home alone but it was too late. The damage was done. He made himself look back up. He deserved it. Deserved to see what he had done to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrinkles carved through her forehead, stealing the pretty girl who had just handed him a beer. \"I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back to the carpet and waited for something to happen, expecting her to at least break something or start slamming doors, anything to dispel the ghostly quiet sucking the air from the room. When her feet started moving, his world fell to pieces. This was it. She was showing him the door and the thought of never kissing those lips again broke his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned off the iPod dock and he could see it now without even looking up\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pleading with her tomorrow at Sugars (the only place he could get her to talk to him) while Brooke and Ben stood there gravely shaking their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally mustered the courage to look up, wanting to just get it over with and take his medicine. Evy pulled the lasagna from the oven and quietly set it on the burners. She stared at the steamy pan of melted cheese like she was trying to determine if it was done or not, but he knew better. She was really trying to determine if they were done or not. He twisted his fingers, making them pop, and grappled for assuring words that didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy turned around and folded her arms across her breasts like they were now off limits to him. \"So let me see if I\u0027ve got this straight,\" she said, sauntering back into the living room while staring past him with faraway eyes. \"You had sex with a girl named...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Megan.\" He hated the way her name sounded on his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had sex with a girl name Megan a week before you met me and...now she\u0027s pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegedly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in front of him, close enough to intoxicate his senses with her perfume. It drove him crazy and she knew it. \"And how long had you two been dating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into her eyes, not wanting to answer this question more than anything in the world. \"A day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw hit the floor, along with his heart, as she realized she was right all along. He was just another player, taking what he wanted with no concern for anyone else. She sat down before she could collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean took a seat on the edge of the couch, a broken man against warm gray on cream plaid. \"After I met you, everyone else just...faded away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer watery gaze drained his spirit. He wanted to wrap her in his arms and make it right but that was impossible. He hadn\u0027t felt this helpless since his first Christmas without his parents. Like now, the only option then had been to keep breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes thinned. \"I thought you said you never have sex without a condom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" he said, acting overly offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you didn\u0027t with me, so...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used protection, but somehow...\" The words died on his lips, knowing he would never kiss her again. It tortured his soul. The punishment didn\u0027t fit the crime and he was powerless to alter its path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she sure it\u0027s yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Who really knows, Evy? For all I know, she\u0027s crazy as hell and full of shit, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you only knew her for a day, so you really don\u0027t know her at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to speak but dropped her gaze instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what does Megan plan to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean shut his eyes and rubbed his face. \"She wants to keep it,\" he said in barely a whisper, not wanting her to hear those words most of all, wanting to protect her from the ghastly truth. How could she continue in a relationship with a man who was having a baby with another woman? She couldn\u0027t. The answer was obvious and he didn\u0027t blame her. He blamed himself for being a selfish dick, for satisfying his own needs at the expense of others. He had broken a lot of hearts over the years and now it was his turn to pay the pied piper. Justice served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet she does,\" Evy muttered, blinking a lone tear down her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his ears rang and his heart broke for her, rage heated to a boil inside. Two souls destined to be together for all of eternity, torn apart in one fell swoop by the evil claws of retribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy watched him in repugnance. Hurt and anger littered her countenance like never before. His jaw tightened with his fists, squeezing together until a vein bulged in his forehead. With all his might, he held her gaze, vowing he wouldn\u0027t give up without a fight because, after all, he was a fighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother tear trickled down her cheek and his hands relaxed. It didn\u0027t matter if he was a fighter or not. It wasn\u0027t fair for him to continue such a lofty pursuit while bringing such grim consequences to the one he loved the most. And that\u0027s when it hit him: he loved her. But how could she tell her family and friends that her man was having a baby with some blond named Megan? She didn\u0027t deserve this. If he really loved her, he had to let her go. If the shoe was on the other foot, and she was pregnant with another man\u0027s baby, he sure as hell wouldn\u0027t want any part of it. She deserved better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smell pushed him to the brink of destruction. The thought of living without her watered a seed of misery blooming in the pit of his stomach. He looked up just in time to see her wipe away another tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy\u0027s brow folded, like he had just said something nasty about her weight. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped her piercing glower and shifted nervously on the couch. \"I know it\u0027s too late now but...\" He inhaled a deep breath to steady his shaky voice, his eyes rising to find hers. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face warped in the deafening silence that followed. His gut ached. He hadn\u0027t planned on telling her anything let alone this. His thoughts spiraled out of control along with his tongue. He buried his face in his hands to stop it, embarrassed to be alive and desperate not to lose the one thing he wanted more than anything in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his face up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy glared at him like a statue carved from a cold gravestone, bravely trying to mask her emotions. \"Get out,\" she repeated slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her without speaking, unable to tell if this was really happening or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need some time to...process all of this,\" she said, confirming it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean nodded his understanding and got up. His knee cracked and he paused to take one last look at her beautiful face. Knowing this could be the last time he ever saw her made him want to say something to change her mind. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he mumbled, turning for the door. His legs felt like rubber, like he had just run stairs at Miller Park. His hand grasped the doorknob but didn\u0027t turn it, giving her a little more time to tell him to wait, to come back. When she didn\u0027t, he opened the door and left her apartment without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy sat in silence, watching the front door shut with a symbolic click, the dull thud of her beating heart the only sound in the room as Dean\u0027s steps faded down the hallway into the night. She glanced at the pan of lasagna on the stove and turned back to the front door, imagining herself bolting through it and catching up to him in the street. She could see a flicker of hope in his eyes and it made her heart quiver. She got to her feet and went to the door, grabbed the knob but didn\u0027t turn. Her eyes studied the weathered white paint covering the thick wood, the metal cold and smooth in her hand. A thousand thoughts flipped through her vaporous head like a bad fever dream. She turned the worn knob but didn\u0027t pull. She could still catch him and figure this out together. Evy realized she had been holding her breath and let it out, locking the deadbolt and leaning her forehead against the door, wondering if she was cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke looked up from behind the counter when the bell rang above the glass front door. Her face sobered as Evy weaved through the mostly empty tables like a wayward drunk. \"What\u0027s wrong, sweetie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy came around the counter and pushed past her, bursting through the swinging door and spilling into Sugars\u0027 brightly lit kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen sat at the silver table in the middle of the room, munching on a cupcake while sculpting a cake into a red high heel. Chocolate frosting clung to the tip of his nose and the outside of a nearby glass of chocolate milk. He turned to Evy and stopped chewing, his worn out trucker\u0027s hat shading his wrinkled brow. \"Are you okay?\" he asked, lowering the half eaten cupcake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke barged through the swinging door and came around for a better look. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy wiped tears from her face and plopped onto a wooden stool, her shoulders slumping as badly as her features. \"He got some girl pregnant,\" she blurted, bursting into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke\u0027s face fell almost as fast as her husband\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" Ben gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you, idiot!\" Evy snapped. \"Dean!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen swallowed hard and wiped frosting on his Slipknot concert tee, a heavy frown stealing across his face. \"Dean? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had sex with her! How do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen tipped his cap back, a dumbfounded look warping his attractive features like a funhouse mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke rubbed Evy\u0027s back and spoke in a soothing tone. \"It\u0027s okay, honey, take a deep breath and tell us what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy shook her head in frustration, like she didn\u0027t know what had happened. \"It was some girl he hooked up with the weekend before we met and now she\u0027s pregnant and I don\u0027t know how this could be happening but it is and everything is ruined!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay\" Brooke said softly. \"Just slow down and start from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMascara ran down Evy\u0027s cheeks in inky streams. \"Some girl named Megan is pregnant with his child,\" she cried, slamming her fist down on the stainless steel table and making Ben and his milk jump at the same time. \"I should\u0027ve known better!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen swiveled toward Evy on his stool. \"So hold up, you mean he slept with this girl before he met you and now she\u0027s pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what he just told me at my apartment. We were supposed to be having movie night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped her cold gaze and toyed with one of the black loops in his ears. \"Talk about bad timing,\" he muttered under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh honey,\" Brooke said with a motherly tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy pushed her away and rested her elbows on the table. Her vacant eyes blurred the tattoos wrapping Ben\u0027s burly arms into colorful blobs. \"And then he had the nerve to tell me he loved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke\u0027s pretty face soured. \"He didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did.\" Evy wiped tears away, smearing black streaks across her cheeks. \"And the worst part is...I love him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke and Ben traded apprehensive looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sweetie,\" Brooke cooed, pulling Evy into her arms and hugging her tight. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she whispered, stroking her hair like Dean used to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy buried her face into Brooke\u0027s neck and opened the floodgates, soaking her sister\u0027s work shirt. \"What kind of man says that to someone when another woman is pregnant with his baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A desperate one,\" Ben snorted, looking away when both women shot him icy glares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, let\u0027s just figure this whole thing out,\" Brooke said, holding Evy out for a better look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy\u0027s breath came in staggered hitches. \"I\u0027m sorry for coming here and dumping this on you guys, but I didn\u0027t have anywhere else to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came to the right place, little lady,\" Ben smiled, patting her hand. \"I\u0027m going to go check on the customers and I\u0027ll be right back with something to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke watched him disappear up front and let out an exasperated breath as she sat down on one of the wooden stools. The lights hummed louder in the quiet swooping down upon the spotless kitchen like a plague of locusts. Brooke bit her bottom lip. \"But, technically, he didn\u0027t cheat on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Evy fired back. \"He didn\u0027t cheat on me, Brooke, but this is...almost worse. The man I love is having a baby with another woman.\" She set her jaw and backhanded a stack of cupcake wrappers off the table. \"It\u0027s so fucked up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this girl...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Megan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke cleared her throat and started over. \"Is Megan sure Dean is the father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy stared at the dishwasher through blurry eyes. \"So she says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can she be so sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he used protection but...\" Evy buried her face in her hands and cried, unable to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could she be mistaken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? All I know is he\u0027s a player and it\u0027s come back to haunt me.\" She pulled her puffy face from her hands and turned to her sister with a pointed glare. \"I told you, Brooke,\" she grumbled. \"But oh no, you made me go out with him anyway. This is all your fault!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke\u0027s jaw dropped like a rock. Her eyes tightened into slits. \"No,\" she whispered gravely. \"You take that back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go!\" Ben said, coming back into the kitchen with a tray of beers and shots. He stopped in his tracks, digesting the intense looks gripping their faces. \"Is this a bad time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Evy said faintly. \"I-I didn\u0027t mean that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke\u0027s eyes welled up with tears. \"I know you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen quietly backpedaled out of the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Freeze!\" Brooke said, nodding to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crept over and carefully set the drinks down. \"I\u0027ve got just the thing for a broken heart.\" He rubbed his hands together like a wizard about to conjure up a magic potion. \"Tequila and beer. Works every time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke pressed her lips together. \"And when have you ever had a broken heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen hiked his jeans up by a chain connecting his wallet to a belt loop. \"Seventh grade when Annie Creighton picked Rusty Callahan over me to go to the school dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God, here we go again,\" Brooke mumbled under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought new shoes and everything,\" he sighed, taking his cap off and wiping a greasy sheen from the five o\u0027clock shadow sprouting across his shaved head. He pulled the hat down so low his eyes were barely visible. \"I would\u0027ve eaten a shit sandwich for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke and Evy stared at him like he had just broken wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alrighty then,\" he said, raising one of the shot glasses into the air. \"No time like the present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, this isn\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck it\" Evy said, snatching up a shot glass and knocking it back in a single gulp. Brooke traded a glance with Ben and he shrugged. They followed suit, knocking the shots back and slamming the glasses onto the metal table with a loud clang. Brooke\u0027s face contorted with the tequila\u0027s burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll make your dick hard,\" Ben wheezed, chasing the shot with a long drink of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy arched an eyebrow at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed. \"What?

You want it, you gotta take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy\u0027s entire body shuddered with another hiccup. \"Why do you always make me feel like the kid sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke\u0027s face brightened. \"Because I\u0027m so smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy bit back a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Brooke said, pulling her sister\u0027s arm down so she could see her face. \"Do you love Dean or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy looked up with glassy eyes, staring blankly at Brooke like she hadn\u0027t understood the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love him or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy blinked a tear down her cheek. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then fight for him,\" she whispered, leaning back and taking a drink of her beer. \"Plus, if his cock is half as big as you say it is, you can\u0027t let that go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy shielded her eyes with a hand. \"I never said how big it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s just wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA comfortable silence fell between them as Brooke released a lion-like yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy looked into her little sister\u0027s eyes and smiled. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke shrugged. \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy reached out and hugged her tightly. \"For always being there for me. I love you and Ben so much. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke brushed hair from Evy\u0027s face. \"Regardless of what happens, you\u0027re going to be fine. Just remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen burst through the backdoor, a bottle of beer in his hand. \"So, we gonna have a threesome tonight or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke turned to Evy with a tired sigh. \"I don\u0027t know how I do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvy hiccupped again. \"I need a cab.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fate-interrupted-fate-interrupted-1/page-8.html","bookId":1872,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:22 PM"}
