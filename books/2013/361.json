Just lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey worked their weary mounts up an embankment all overgrown with bushes, and Beak was forced to concentrate even harder to mute the sounds of scrabbling hoofs and snapping brush, and the candle in his head flared suddenly and he very nearly reeled from his saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain’s hand reached across and steadied him. ‘Beak?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s hot,’ he muttered. And now, all at once, he could suddenly see where all this was going, and what he would need to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horses broke the contact between them as they struggled up the last of the ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hold,’ Faradan Sort murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Beak sighed. ‘Just ahead, Captain. We found them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA score of trees had been felled and left to rot directly ahead, and on this side of that barrier was a scum-laden pool on which danced glittering insects. Two marines smeared in mud rose from the near side of the bank, crossbows at the ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain raised her right hand and made a sequence of gestures, and the crossbows swung away and they were waved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a mage crouched in a hollow beneath one of the felled trees, and she gave Beak a nod that seemed a little nervous. He waved back as they reined in ten paces from the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mage called out from her cover: ‘Been expecting you two. Beak, you got a glow so bright it’s damned near blinding.’ Then she laughed. ‘Don’t worry, it’s not the kind the Edur can see, not even their warlocks. But I’d dampen it down some, Beak, lest you burn right up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain turned to him and nodded. ‘Rest now, Beak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRest? No, there could be no rest. Not ever again. ‘Sir, there are hundreds of Edur coming. From the northwest-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We know,’ the other mage said, clambering out like a toad at dusk. ‘We was just getting ready to pack our travelling trunks and the uniforms are pressed and the standards restitched in gold.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Really?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobered and there was a sudden soft look in her eyes, reminding Beak of that one nurse his mother had hired, the one who was then raped by his father and had to go away. ‘No, Beak, just havin’ fun.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad, he considered. He would like to have seen that gold thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dismounted and walked their horses round one end of the felled trees, and there, before them, was the Fist’s encampment. ‘Hood’s mercy,’ Faradan Sort said, ‘there’s more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Six hundred and seventy-one, sir,’ Beak said. And like the mage had said, there were getting ready to leave, swarming like ants on a kicked mound. There had been wounded-lots of them-but the healers had done their work and all the blood smelled old and the smell of death stayed where it belonged, close to the dozen graves on the far side of the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Come along,’ said the captain as two soldiers arrived to take charge of the horses, and Beak followed her as she made her way to where stood Fist Keneb and Sergeant Thorn Tissy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt strange to be walking after so long seated in those strange Letherii saddles, as if the ground was crumbling underfoot, and everything looked oddly fragile. Yes. My friends. All of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How bad?’ Keneb asked Faradan Sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We couldn’t reach them,’ she replied, ‘but there is still hope. Fist, Beak says we have to hurry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fist glanced at Beak and the young mage nearly wilted. Attention from important people always did that to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb nodded, then sighed. ‘I want to keep waiting, in case…’ He shook his head. ‘Fair enough. It’s time to change tactics.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir,’ said the captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We push hard. For the capital, and if we run into anything we can’t handle… we handle it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Captain, gather ten squads with full complement of heavies. Take command of our rearguard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’ She turned and took Beak by the arm. ‘I want you on a stretcher, Beak,’ she said as she led him along. ‘Sleeping.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can’t, sir-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, I really can’t. The candles, they won’t go out. Not any more. They won’t go out.’ Not ever, Captain, and it isn’t that I don’t love you because I do and I’d do anything you asked. But I just can’t and I can’t even explain. Only, it’s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t sure what she saw in his eyes, wasn’t sure how much of all that he didn’t say got heard anyway, but the grip of her hand on his arm loosened, became almost a caress, and she nodded and turned her head away. ‘All right, Beak. Help us guard Keneb’s back, then.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-361.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
