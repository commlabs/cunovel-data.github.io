Two unmanned drones moved through the clouds full of radiation, passing by the two vehicle fleets and flying forward. The communication device on Henry’s wrist lit up, and a doughty looking officer shouted loudly, “Your distinguished self, we discovered a hidden fleet 1300 meters out.

Henry directly jumped off the off-road vehicle, and then several dozen fully armed soldiers hurriedly leapt out from the off-road vehicles as well. They followed behind Henry towards the location where the vehicle fleet was hidden.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It seems like there is trouble!” Li Gaolei laughed bitterly, and then he stood up from his place of hiding.

It seemed like the other party expended quite the capital. In addition, from the vehicle’s markings, it didn’t seem to be the insignia of the Black Dragonriders or some family, but instead that of the Blood Parliament!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi Gaolei forcefully suppressed the unease in his heart, and then he said to Li and the soldiers, “Defend your positions!

He then pointed at Li Gaolei, and then with his mouth almost sticking to Jast’s ear, he roared, “Do you have eyes? This fella is named Li Gaolei, Su’s core subordinate! Core subordinate!!

The hollering by his ear was comparable to thunder. A thin streak of blood flowed out from his ears. The sturdy dragonrider uniform’s collar now completely became a noose, and under the arm that released six levels of ability, his weak body didn’t have any power to retaliate. Even without all the powder on his face, it would still be as white as paper.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Su… Su is in front…” Jast’s hands grabbed rigidly at Henry’s arm as he spat out these words one after another with great difficulty from his throat.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Su my ass!” Henry’s left hand raised upwards, and then it heavily slapped Jast onto the ground. His right fist slammed heavily down on Jast’s face.
