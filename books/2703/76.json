After Caroline seated herself beside Reese, I hesitated. It didn’t feel as if I belonged with these people. They were so nice and full of outgoing vivacity. I felt like a great big blah of an outsider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick glanced at me and held out a hand. “Need some help up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh!” I gulped, touched by his invitation. No matter how I felt, though, it seemed they were accepting me with a warm welcome. Unable to turn him down, I took his hand and stepped onto the bottom rung before hoisting myself up next to Caroline. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now there’s a sight for sore eyes,” Pick said, glancing appreciatively down the counter at the five of us women. “You ladies sure know how to decorate my nightclub.” He paused in front of Eva to give her another kiss before he wandered toward Asher, who was lingering around the base of the stage and fiddling with a few wires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the waitresses had unlocked the doors. A doorman had appeared somewhere and was letting a line of people in through the entrance. And the place was beginning to fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any of you ladies thirsty?” Noel asked. “I know the only one here not underage is Aspen, so…can I get you some sodas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline groaned and rolled her eyes, while Reese said, “Mason can get my drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mine too,” Eva was quick to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Caroline opened her mouth, her brother pointed at her warningly. “No way. You’re just getting soda.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she scowled and narrowed her eyes, I spoke up. “I’ll take a Sprite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel grinned approvingly at me before glancing pointedly at his sister. Her shoulder slumped as she mumbled, “One for me too, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d just gotten our drinks and were slurping from the straws when Caroline tensed beside me. “Oh God. Oren’s here,” she said under her breath as she leaned in close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to watch the bouncer let him into the club. A pair of guys immediately jumped on him from behind and greeted him with tackles and laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe he came tonight since he doesn’t have to work.” Poor Caroline. She seemed so tense and on edge as she fiddled with her straw and watched every move he made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he wanted to see the band perform too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t answer, probably hadn’t even heard me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I watched him too as he made his way through the crowd. I was a little jealous how personable he was. He seemed to know everyone, girls and guys alike. When one girl he greeted lifted up onto her tiptoes to whisper something into his ear and make him grin, I reached out and grasped Caroline’s hand. She clutched my fingers for dear life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally noticed us when he turned toward the bar, or maybe it was the row of five women sitting on the countertop that caught his attention. But his gaze lingered on Caroline before he ordered a bottled beer from Noel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he approached us, swaggering closer. I thought Caroline was going to squeeze my fingers clean off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if isn’t a whole row of untouchables,” he mused, glancing down at the five of us as he took a sip. He looked almost sad as his gaze slid over Caroline and kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Eva cheerfully called, “Ten-Ten, what’re you talking about untouchables? You can come over here and touch me any time you want. If you get too inappropriate, my man’ll just knock your head off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Invitation accepted.” He moved to her. “Hey, Milk Tits. You still breastfeeding those kids of yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes but perked out her chest. “What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah.” He laughed and rested his arm on her leg as he drank his beer and gazed out into the gathering crowd. He didn’t seem to be in any hurry to leave, which didn’t help ease Caroline’s grip on my hand at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYikes. I wondered how long it’d take for permanent damage to set in since there was obviously no blood circulating to my fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zoey? Is that you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around at the call and blinked when I saw Cora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” She climbed up onto the bar beside me and engulfed me in a huge hug, which I stiffly returned. The last time I’d seen her, she’d been threatening me to stay away from her boyfriend. And now...now apparently we were back to being friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBipolar much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know you were coming tonight,” she called over the growing noise of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I...Caroline invited me,” I said, then I couldn’t help but glance over her shoulder, looking for him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-76.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
