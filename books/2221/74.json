You soundin’ like five-oh to me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a cop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me some more. “Why you come to me?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was given your name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pat Beulke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDogman-G glanced over his shoulder at the man standing behind him. “We know that boy?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said, “We know ’im.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well ’nuff he can drop my name careless like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take care of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy inner voice said, Tsk, tsk, tsk, poor Pat, but I knew sarcasm when I heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDogman-G looked across the table at me. His face had the bemused expression of a man who made his living catering to the vices of others. “Wha’ you wan’ know?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifty large is a lot of money. I want to make sure I heard the price right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s cool. Fifty is the number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you buying the hit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, man,” Dogman said. “I jus’ the messenger. I know who gots the presidents, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who would that be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why you wan’ to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s personal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zat right? Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the two black men knew what to do with their hands. They began reaching for weapons. Except I was quicker. My hands came out of my pockets. In my right was the nine-millimeter Beretta that I pointed at the dude standing behind Dogman’s shoulder. In my left was the .380 that I leveled at the chest of the black man sitting between Dogman and me. They raised their empty hands without being told to, although I didn’t think they were surrendering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentlemen,” I said, “I do not want to die, but if I do I’m not dying first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke loudly enough to spook the spectators who were milling about, waiting for the dogfight to begin. When they saw my guns, most made a rush for the door. About a dozen crawled under a gap in the back of the pole barn and fled toward the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you crazy, man?” Dogman-G wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s just say I’ve thrown caution to the wind and let it go at that. So, what do they call you? Dogman, or G?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“G—I’m going to call you G. Listen, G, I’m really pissed off. Now you are going to tell me what I want to know or I’m going to shoot all three of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going to stop me? Fear of dying? I’ve got a fifty-thousand-dollar contract on my head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have it your own way. Which one of your pals do you like the least? Know what? I’ll choose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighted down the .380 at the black man on my left, gritting my teeth as if I were about to squeeze the trigger. He recoiled, his hands splayed in front of his face. “No, no, man,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” Dogman said. “I said wait. I mean it. Wait. That’s my brother you’re lookin’ to cap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t we all brothers under the skin?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My brother brother, you shithead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk to me, G.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ease off, now. I’ll tell you what you wan’ to know. Just ease off. Fuckin’ crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who bought the hit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll say, but it ain’t gonna do you no good. You be dead soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You betcha.” I couldn’t believe I said that. God, I how I hate the Coen brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DuWayne. DuWayne Middleton. It was him who put out the contract.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is DuWayne Middleton?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guns were getting heavy; my extended arms were beginning to ache, and my hands wavered just a little. The way Dogman-G’s posse glanced at each other, I knew that they had seen it. I couldn’t keep this up much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said. “Why does he want me dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t say. Just said to pass the word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where can I find him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ain’t his social secretary, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This DuWayne Middleton. He ever go by the name T-Man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck if I know. Maybe when he was in stir. Only I ain’t never heard him called that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve been a real prince, G. Now stand up slowly. You, too,” I told his brother. “Keep your hands up.” When they were all standing, I told them to take four steps backward. Then I stood straight up, not an easy thing to do while pointing two guns at three men; the back of my legs pushed against the folding chair. Dogman-G and his posse watched it tip over and clatter against the concrete floor. I ignored the chair and started walking backward, never taking my eyes from the three men, wondering where Schroeder was. Dogman-G’s brother started to lower his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah-ah,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised them again. He didn’t look particularly frightened, and the farther away I got, the less frightened he appeared. From the expression on his face, I knew he couldn’t wait to put me in the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and started running. I had been doing a lot of that lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprinted through the open door of the pole barn. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/madman-on-a-drum-mac-mckenzie-5/page-74.html","bookId":2221,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:11 PM"}
