Once they passed 33 miles, the pressure suddenly rose to yet another level. Every time they flew up 10 more feet they would have to consume massive amounts of energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was hard to imagine just how deep the true essence of these two people was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“They will soon reach the Emperor Stone.

Just what is happening today that three people suddenly appear who can leave behind a mark on the Emperor Stone?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone felt as if they were in some fantastical dream. Not too far away from them, Monster Prince Duyu’s eyes were brilliant as he stared at Lin Ming. Lin Ming would soon break past 34 miles. He himself had also reached this height and understood just how great the pressure of the last mile was. The last mile was the greatest and most difficult to bear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This brat… he’s actually not falling behind Xiao Moxian at all! I can’t believe that he still has so much strength left over. After passing 34 miles, the pressure will rise to another difficulty. If he can’t retain any strength then it will be impossible to leave behind a mark on the Emperor Stone. I want to see just how you do this…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu had thought that Lin Ming would fly to around 30 miles at most. He didn’t imagine that Lin Ming would soon reach the Emperor Stone, and that his speed would also be consistent with Xiao Moxian’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe found this all hard to accept.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Monster Prince Duyu had said, for the last mile of Precipice Cliff, the pressure indeed increased by several times.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnderneath that massive pressure, Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian suddenly slowed down as if they had run into a wall. The aura of Precipice Cliff was really far too strong here; it was tangible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Finally, a little bit of a challenge.” Xiao Moxian laughed. She looked at Lin Ming as black flames wrapped around her entire body. In the next moment, she ascended like a blazing star, her speed suddenly increasing!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for Lin Ming, he activated the power of the Azure Dragon within his body. His feet pressed against the stone wall, and with the force of the recoil he pushed upwards, shooting high like an arrow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the same time, Lin Ming waved his right hand, bringing out the Phoenix Blood Spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCa!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe long spear slashed out. Spear light recklessly cut through the barrier of pressure, tearing it. Lin Ming passed through this gap like a fish and impacted upwards, his speed also increasing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu’s eyes nearly fell out of their sockets. He was waiting for Lin Ming to admit defeat at this time, or at least approach his limit. But, he never imagined that Lin Ming would rush upwards at an even fiercer pace than before. It was clear that he had retained a tremendous amount of strength!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow was this possible…?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu was shocked. To retain so much strength in such a situation and even go up faster than before? Just who was he?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe originally thought that Lin Ming was a native martial artist of the Asura Road. Moreover, Lin Ming gave off a very humble and ordinary feeling, the type that you wouldn’t notice in a crowd of people. When he killed vicious beasts on the road here, he had relied on his experience to use tricks to defeat them; this couldn’t be considered his true strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, looking at Lin Ming’s performance on Precipice Cliff, it was true that he was the peak genius of an entire race!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Good, great!” Xiao Moxian joyously laughed as she looked at Lin Ming. Beneath the great pressure of the Emperor Stone she was still able to freely laugh as before. This left everyone beneath her startled and awed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Your potential is amazing, but… I haven’t even transformed. I’ve already won this competition!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Xiao Moxian spoke she suddenly swept her sleeves downwards. As she did so, black flames tumbled all around her, forming bird-like wings of flames. She immediately pulled ahead!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe 35 mile Emperor Stone checkpoint was broken through!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian had no plan to stop and leave her mark here. She continued flying upwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Emperor Stone was exactly one mile in diameter. To leave her mark on the top was an enormous difference from leaving her mark on the bottom. Xiao Moxian clearly wouldn’t be satisfied with leaving her mark on the lowest area; she wanted to leave her name on the highest peak!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for Lin Ming, he also had such a plan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Xiao Moxian broke through the 35 mile mark she felt as if she had stepped into a different space. All around her the Space and Time Laws were strangely distorted. At the same time a dreadful force field came shrouding down over her body, forcefully preventing her ascent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What powerful Space and Time Laws, and there is also this formidable force field. This Emperor Stone truly is marvelous.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter being blocked by this terrifying strength, Xiao Moxian felt the blood surge within her and her energy become chaotic. Although she could withstand this, it placed a great strain on her. If this continued then she might be able to go several hundred feet more at most.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Phoenix Trueform!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian’s eyes blazed with a divine light. Her pupils turned purple-black, as if a raging inferno grew there.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a resonant phoenix cry, a massive amount of fire origin energy gathered behind Xiao Moxian. The raging energy gushed out all around her and a pair of pitch black phoenix wings stretched out from her back, proud and strong!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese black phoenix wings were over 15 feet wide together, twice the height of an adult male. Compared to these spacious wings, Xiao Moxian’s figure appeared delicate and petite. She could easily wrap herself up in these wings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHu – Hu – Hu –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe massive amounts of fire origin energy condensed into black flames that combusted all around her. Soon after, these black flames turned into a roiling sea of fire that turned the entire sky a shimmering black!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter transforming her body into her Phoenix Trueform, Xiao Moxian was in her strongest state. She was like a dark goddess of the night, ruling over everyone, demanding their worship.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the many martial artists beneath Precipice Cliff saw this, all of them were shocked. This black-clothed girl was also from the monster race. This sort of bloodline seemed to contain some indescribably majestic and royal aura, making everyone want to fall to their knees.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior-apprentice Sister is too strong! I haven’t seen her take action for two years and yet her strength has already grown to this degree. Even though I am several years older than her I am still not her match. The title of the number one most talented genius in the Divine Realm is hers beyond reproach!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu couldn’t help but praise. At the same time, his visions as he looked towards her became increasingly hot. This was a look of yearning mixed with desire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Xiao Moxian transformed her body, her strength suddenly increased. The Emperor Stone’s pressure was broken apart by her wings. She continued flying straight up!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Lanjian, if you haven’t held back anything then you’re as good as defeated!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian’s clear and crisp voice sounded out in Lin Ming’s ear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming also couldn’t help but commend Xiao Moxian in his mind. Her Phoenix Trueform really did defy the heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Lin Ming sunk all of his energy into his inner world. As he stepped upon the Emperor Stone, the power of thunder and fire heavenly tribulation within the Heretical God Tree suddenly exploded outwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBehind Lin Ming, the phantom of the Heretical God Tree appeared!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the Heretical God Force opened to the limit, Lin Ming also opened the complete Eight Inner Hidden Gates. With all eight gates opened, surging waves of astral essence flooded through Lin Ming’s body. His entire body emitted crackling noises as if thunderbolts were rolling through his body, like a True Dragon was awakening in his heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, Lin Ming’s mortal bodily strength rose to several hundred millions of jins! Even the starlight in the sky above was quickened by him. The silver threads of starlight converged within Lin Ming’s body, gathering towards nine acupoints, forming a faint mirage of nine Dao Palaces!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs these Dao Palaces emerged, they instantly vanished as if they were never there to begin with. This was the boundary of the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the Eternal Demon Abyss, Lin Ming had already gazed upon the threshold of the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace. Although he was still an extremely great distance from reaching the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, this was still something that the more ordinary Eight Inner Hidden Gates couldn’t possibly compete with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a loud explosion of energy, Lin Ming was like a human-shaped beast after he released the Eight Inner Hidden Gates to the limit. He rushed forwards, chasing straight upwards with Xiao Moxian!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOne dragon and one phoenix, racing up hand in hand, with unstoppable force!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA 35 mile height, the height at which the Emperor Stone was, still couldn’t stop them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This… they’ve reached the Emperor Stone but they still aren’t satisfied? Do they plan on leaving their mark on the pinnacle of the Emperor Stone?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who are they? That monster youth from before was abnormal enough, but compared to these two people the difference is like mud and clouds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone began to shout out loud. If Monster Prince Duyu were to be compared to Xiao Moxian and Lin Ming, the difference really was too great!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn truth, in terms of strength, Monster Prince Duyu wasn’t much worse than Xiao Moxian and Lin Ming. But, what Precipice Cliff challenged was one’s potential and talent! In other words, their future achievements!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen comparing this, Monster Prince Duyu wasn’t able to match Xiao Moxian or Lin Ming at all. The disparity was far too great.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd at this time, an even more startling scene occurred. The black-clothed girl that was flying up the Emperor Stone suddenly attacked the caped youth!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian’s whip came slashing out. Blazing flames roared forth, forming snakes of flame that instantly enveloped Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis caused the entire audience to be scared witless. This was the height of the Emperor Stone, a height that surpassed 35 miles! If it were them at that height they wouldn’t even be able to resist the pressure of the Emperor Stone. That great pressure would directly wound them and cause them to vomit blood, but as for that young boy and girl, they actually still had the strength to fight!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was too aggravating!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming watched the fire snakes about to strike him, he arched an eyebrow upwards. “You want to sneak attack me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe! We’re only competing on who can win, but we never placed limits on the methods we can use. In other words, we can use any method we want, so why can’t I sneak attack you?” Xiao Moxian laughed out loud. Because she had used most of her strength to resist the pressure of the Emperor Stone, the striking power of her attack wasn’t strong at all. Rather, it was extremely tricky, with many changes that made it hard to predict.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, this wasn’t a problem at all to Lin Ming. His spear speed could also reach the limit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Chasing Thunder!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Phoenix Blood Spear thrust out. With a sparkle of electric purple light, Lin Ming’s spear broke through the fire snakes!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If you want to attack me, then does that mean I can attack you?” Lin Ming asked back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Of course, there is no need go easy on me otherwise there would be no point in winning.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You’re quite confident in yourself. Do you think your true combat strength can compare with mine?” Lin Ming grasped the Phoenix Blood Spear, gathering his strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm… probably not… however, I think that in my repertoire of skills, I have something quite suitable for this current situation, so I’ve as good as won!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian smiled wide, her cherry red lips parting to reveal her small canines.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHer wings suddenly spread out.
