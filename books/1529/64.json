From the pirates, from the madness. The tribesmen are their only hope. And they know me. They\u0027ll listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barnhardt stepped to the young nurse\u0027s side. \"I\u0027ll help him. We\u0027ll attempt to set up some secure barricade. Gather as many as we can. To wait you all out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Miller stared with reluctance toward the open hatchway, then down to the dead doctor. He nodded. \"These . . . these are our people. Our friends and colleagues. We can\u0027t leave them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa hugged each one in turn. \"Henri. . .\" she mumbled in a half plead to the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man squeezed her and pushed her toward the open doorway. \"Go get Susan. More than our lives, the cure must be taken beyond the Guild\u0027s reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa nodded and allowed Monk to turn her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed Ryder into the launch bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk\u0027s steps faltered as he cleared the doorway and spotted Ryder\u0027s boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy Mother of Christ!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:43 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh descended toward the darkened stage of the ship\u0027s musical theater. The glittering crimson curtain hung closed. He followed the broad back of the Somalian guard down the theater stairs. After being ambushed and driven away from the tender docks, Devesh and the guard had fled up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown was not an option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams and cries had chased them up the stairwell. Down in the ship\u0027s bowels, Devesh had opened all five storage holds, unleashing the horrors contained within. They\u0027d been feeding on one another, the strongest preying on the weakest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver two hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKept for experimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh had sought to use the unleashed madness to combat the cleverness of the ship\u0027s attackers, to thwart them long enough for him to orchestrate a return to the ship with grenades and machine guns. He would then slaughter the whole lot of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would retake his ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the moment, he was caught in his own trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his Somalian bodyguard who had come up with this plan to escape. To reach the tender docks, rather than descending any of the main stairs, the Somalian had led Devesh to the upper balcony entrance of the ship\u0027s three-story-tall theater. They used the theater\u0027s stairs to descend the three levels back down to the deck that housed the tender dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theater\u0027s lower doors lay directly across the hallway from the dock. A short dash, and they\u0027d be motoring away from this hellish battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh used his cane to thump down the last few stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Somalian guard held up a hand and headed to the door. \"Stay back. Let me make sure it\u0027s clear.\" He clutched a large pistol in his other fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cracked open the door, checked the hall, covering it with his pistol. He waited a breath, then opened it farther. Turning, he announced with relief, \"Hall\u0027s clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh took a step toward himâ€”but movement over the man\u0027s shoulder stopped him. One of the feathered tribesman stepped out of hiding, sheltered within the hatchway that led down to the tender dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cannibal held a drawn bow in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large Somalian must have read something in Devesh\u0027s expression. Even before fully turning around, the man began firing blindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cannibal took three shots to the chest, falling back with a sharp cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the tribesman had already let loose his bowstring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrow pierced the guard\u0027s throat, sprouting like some bloody tongue out the back of his neck. The large man stumbled, fell to his backside. Still, he kept his pistol pointed toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the cannibal did not rise again, and the hall remained quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh knew he had to take the chance. He rushed to the guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me,\" the man croaked out, eyes winced with pain, slipping back to one arm to support himself. The other arm trembled to hold the pistol up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh kicked the man\u0027s supporting arm out from under him. The Somalian fell back, startled. The arrow tip cracked against the polished wood floor. Devesh knelt on the man\u0027s shoulder and tossed his cane aside. He needed a better weapon. He wrestled the pistol from the man\u0027s grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the large man refused to relent, fingers clenched with fury and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go!\" Devesh shifted his knee to dig against the embedded arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud wooden crash stopped their struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors on the opposite side of the theater had banged open behind them. Devesh yanked the pistol free and turned. A figure flew into view, swift on tiny feet, swirling in silk, stained with swaths of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surina!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was not alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA roil of shapes pursued her, fueled by adrenaline and hunger. They poured in after her. Some slipped on the polished wood, down to knuckles, then up again, bestial in their hunt. But the tangled stumbling slowed them long enough for Surina to gain half the theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh scrambled to his feet, both relieved and horrified at her arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurina flew to his side, one arm sweeping down. Her fingers collected his abandoned cane, and in a breath, wood slipped off of steel. She brandished the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh headed toward the open door. \"This way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCradling the pistol in both hands, he leaped over the Somalian, who groaned, only half conscious, blood spreading over the dark wood. At least the man\u0027s body might distract the cannibals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Devesh landed, he felt two sharp bites at the backs of his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a startled step, but suddenly his legs lacked any ability to hold him upright. He fell to a knee in the doorway, then harder to an elbow, knocking the pistol away. The pain rang up his arm to his skull. From the corner of an eye, he watched Surina rise from a low stance behind him, her sword held out to one side, blood spattered from its tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh kicked to stand. But he had no ability to control his legs. He watched blood pouring through the knees of his pants. As Surina slipped past him, he realized what had happened. The bitch had sliced through the tendons at the back of his knees, hamstringing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sailed across the hall and vanished into the darkness of the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surina!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh tried to crawl, dragging his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToward his pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut other hands fell upon him, drawn by the blood, digging into his flesh. He heard the guard\u0027s agonized scream from the depths of the dark theater. Devesh was dragged back to join him, his palms scrabbling through the smears of his own blood, fingers dug for some purchase, some last mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:45 A M\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs screams and gunshots echoed down to them, Lisa joined Monk at the bottom of the launch bay\u0027s stairs. She shivered in the damp breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder\u0027s private bay was small, arched in steel, reeking of gasoline and oil. In the center rested what looked like the aluminum tracks of a roller coaster, consisting of a pair of cushioned rails, tilted at an angle and aimed toward an open hatch in the ship\u0027s side. Beyond the hatch, the dark lagoon beckoned, brushed with sweeps of rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was what rested atop the tracks that continued to hold her partner\u0027s full attention. \"That is no goddamn boat,\" Monk blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder led them forward, hurrying. \"It\u0027s flying boat, mate. Half seaplane, half jet boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk gaped at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa was no less awed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated on the launch tracks, the craft looked like a diving hawk with its wings tucked back. The enclosed cabin ended in an aerodynamic point at the bow. Its stern supported two raised propeller engines. And over the top, two wings lay folded over the cabin, tips touching just in front of the upright tail section and propellers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s built by Hamilton Jet out of New Zealand,\" Ryder said as he ran a hand along her hull and led them to the open side hatch. \"1 call her the Sea Dart. In the water, her twin V-12 petrol engines pump water from the front and shoot it out the stern\u0027s dual nozzles. Once you get her up to speed, all you have to do is explode the hydraulics to snap wide the folded wings, and she sails into the sky... where her rear props keep her aloft.\" Ryder patted its side. \"She\u0027s quick on her legs, too. Sky or water. Clocked her airspeed up to three hundred miles per hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder held out a hand toward Lisa. He helped her up the steps beside the launch track. She ducked into the cabin. It was not that much different from a Cessna: a pair of seats for a pilot and copilot in front and four more seats in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder climbed in behind her and scooted forward to settle into the pilot\u0027s seat. Monk clambered in last, closing the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strap in!\" Ryder called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk took the seat nearest the side hatch, ready to haul Susan inside when they reached the beach. Lisa climbed forward and took the seat next to Ryder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" he said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder triggered an electronic release, and the Sea Dart rolled smoothly down the inclined tracks and dumped into the lagoon with a slight jar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater washed over the windshield as the boat\u0027s bow bobbed deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa immediately heard the rumble of engines behind her, throaty and growling with horsepower. She felt it in the seat of her pants, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dart began to glide forward across the water with a gentle burbling from the stern. Rain rattled in fits and splashes over the top of the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go,\" Ryder mumbled, and throttled the speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat lived up to its name and shot like an arrow across the storm-swept water, throwing Lisa back into her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her an appreciative whistle flowed from Monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder angled the boat, skimming over the water as if on ice. He sailed the boat around the cruise ship\u0027s bow, a gnat before a whale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stared up at the mighty ship. Away from the gunshots and screams, the Mistress of the Seas looked peaceful, gently aglow in the storm\u0027s gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she knew the ship was anything but peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she settled back, she could not escape a slight twinge of guilt. For Jessie, for Henri, and Dr. Miller. And for all the others. She still felt like she was running from a fight, abandoning the others for the sake of her own skin. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-64.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
