She went behind her rock and slowly unbuttoned her skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she peered nervously out, Bond was already halfway down the strip of coarse brown sand that led out among the pools to where the incoming tide eddied through the green and black moraine of the rocks. He looked lithe and brown. The blue pants were reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGingerly she followed him, and then suddenly she was in the water. At once nothing else mattered but the velvet ice of the sea and the beauty of the patches of sand between the waving hair of the seaweed that she could see in the clear green depths below her as she buried her head and swam along parallel with the shore in a fast crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was level with the jetty she stopped for a moment to get her breath. There was no sign of Bond whom she had last seen streaking along a hundred yards ahead of her. She trod water hard to keep up her circulation and then started back again, unwillingly thinking of him, thinking of the hard brown body that must be somewhere near her, among the rocks, perhaps, or diving to the sand to gauge the depth of water that would be available to an enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to look for him again and it was then that he suddenly surged up from the sea beneath her. She felt the quick tight clasp of his arms round her and the swift hard impact of his lips on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you,” she said furiously, but already he had dived again and by the time she had spat out a mouthful of sea-water and got her bearings he was swimming blithely twenty yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and swam aloofly out to sea, feeling rather ridiculous but determined to snub him. It was just as she had thought. These Secret Service people always seemed to have time for sex however important their jobs might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her body obstinately tingled with the shock of the kiss and the golden day seemed to have taken on a new beauty. As she swam further out to sea and then turned back and looked along the snarling milk-white teeth of England to the distant arm of Dover and at the black and white confetti of the ravens and gulls tossed against the vivid backcloth of green fields, she decided that anything was permissible on such a day and that, just this once, she would forgive him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later they were lying, waiting for the sun to dry them, separated by a respectable yard of sand at the foot of the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss had not been mentioned, but Gala’s efforts to preserve an atmosphere of aloofness had collapsed under the excitement of examining a lobster that Bond had dived for and caught with his hands. Reluctantly they put it back into one of the rockpools and watched it scuttle backwards into the shelter of the seaweed. And now they lay, tired and exhilarated by their icy swim, and prayed that the sun would not slip behind the clifftop high above their heads before they were warm and dry enough to get back into their clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those were not Bond’s only thoughts. The beautiful strapping body of the girl beside him, incredibly erotic in the tight emphasis of the clinging brassiere and pants, came between him and his concern about the Moonraker. And anyway there was nothing he could do about the Moonraker for another hour. It was not yet five o’clock and the fuelling would not be finished until after six. It would only be then that he could get hold of Drax and make certain that for the next two nights the guards were strengthened on the cliff and that they had the right weapons. For he had seen for himself that there was plenty of water, even at low tide, for a submarine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there was at least a quarter of an hour to spare before they would have to start back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile this girl. The half-stripped body splayed above him on the surface as he swam up from below; the soft-hard quick kiss with his arms about her; the pointed hillocks of her breasts, so close to him, and the soft flat stomach descending to the mystery of her tightly closed thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo hell with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrenched his mind out of its fever and gazed straight up into the endless blue of the sky, forcing himself to watch the soaring beauty of the herring gulls as they ranged effortlessly among the air currents that fountained up over the high clifftop above them. But the soft down of the birds’ white underbellies seduced his thoughts back to her and gave him no rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you called Gala?” he said to break his hot crouching thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “I was teased about it all through school,” she said, and Bond was impatient at the easy, clear voice, “and then through the Wrens and then by half the police force of London. But my real name’s even worse. It’s Galatea. She was a cruiser my father was serving in when I was born. I suppose Gala’s not too bad. I’ve almost forgotten what I’m called. I’m always having to change my name now that I’m in the Special Branch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the Special Branch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the Special Branch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bomb falls. When the pilot miscalculates and the plane hits short of the runway. When the blood leaves the heart and consciousness goes, there are thoughts in the mind, or words, or perhaps a phrase of music, which ring on for the few seconds before death like the dying clang of a bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond wasn’t killed, but the words were still in his mind, several seconds later, after it had all happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since they had lain down on the sand up against the cliff, while his thoughts had been of Gala, his eyes had been carelessly watching two gulls playing around a wisp of straw that was the edge of their nest on a small ledge about ten feet below the distant top of the cliff. They would crane and bow in their love-play, with only their heads visible to Bond against the dazzling white of the chalk, and then the male would soar out and away and at once back to the ledge to take up his love-making again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond was dreamily watching them as he listened to the girl, when suddenly both gulls dashed away from the ledge with a single shrill scream of fear. At the same moment there was a puff of black smoke and a soft boom from the top of the cliff and a great section of the white chalk directly above Bond and Gala seemed to sway outwards, zigzag cracks snaking down its face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing Bond knew was that he was lying on top of Gala, his face pressed into her cheek, that the air was full of thunder, that his breath was stifled and that the sun had gone out. His back was numb and aching under a great weight and in his left ear, besides the echo of the thunder, there was the end of a choking scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was barely conscious and he had to wait until his senses came halfway back to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Special Branch. What was it she had said about the Special Branch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made frantic efforts to move. Only in his right arm, the arm nearest to the cliff, was there any play at all, but as he jerked his shoulder the arm became freer until at last, with a great backward heave, light and air reached down to them. Retching in the fog of chalk-dust, he widened the hole until his head could take its crushing weight off Gala. He felt the feeble movement as she turned her head sideways towards the light and air. A growing trickle of dust and stones into the hole he had cleared made him dig fiercely again. Gradually he enlarged the space until he could get a purchase on his right elbow and then, coughing so that he thought his lungs would burst, he heaved his right shoulder up until suddenly it and his head were free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first thought was that there had been an explosion in the Moonraker. He looked up at the cliff and then along the shore. No. They were a hundred yards from the site. It was only in the skyline directly above them that a great mouthful had been bitten out of the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he thought of their immediate danger. Gala moaned and he could feel the frantic thud of her heart against his chest, but the ghastly white mask of her face was now free to the air and he wrenched his body from side to side on top of her to try and ease the pressure on her lungs and stomach. Slowly, inch by inch, his muscles cracking under the strain, he worked his way under the pile of dust and rubble towards the cliff face where he knew the weight would be less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then at last his chest was free and he could snake his body into a kneeling position beside her. Blood dripped from his cut back and arms and mingled with the chalk dust that continually poured down the sides of the hole he had made, but he could feel that no bones were broken and, in the rage of the rescue work, he felt no pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunting and coughing and without a pause to take breath he heaved her up into a sitting position and with a bleeding hand wiped some of the chalk dust from her face. Then, freeing his legs from the tomb of chalk, he somehow manhandled her up on to the top of the mound with her back against the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt and looked at her, at the terrible white scarecrow that minutes before had been one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen, and as he looked at her and at the streaks of his blood down her face he prayed that her eyes would open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, seconds later, they did, the relief was so great that Bond turned away and was rackingly sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER XVII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWILD SURMISES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN THE paroxysm was over he felt Gala’s hand in his hair. He looked round and saw her wince at the sight of him. She tugged at his hair and pointed up the cliffs. As she did so a shower of small pieces of chalk rattled down beside them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeakly he got to his knees and then to his feet and together they scrambled and slid down off the mountain of chalk and away from the crater against the cliff from which they had escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harsh sand under their feet was like velvet. They both collapsed full length and lay clutching at it with their horrible white hands as if its rough gold would wash the filthy whiteness away. Then Gala too was mercifully sick and Bond crawled a few paces away to leave her alone. He hauled himself to his feet against a single lump of chalk as big as a small motor-car, and at last his bloodshot eyes took in the hell that had almost engulfed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown to the beginning of the rocks, now lapped by the incoming tide, sprawled the debris of the cliff face, an avalanche of chalk blocks and shapes. The white dust of its collapse covered nearly an acre. Above it a jagged rent had appeared in the cliff and a wedge of blue sky had been bitten out of the distant top where before the line of the horizon had been almost straight. There were no longer any seabirds near them and Bond guessed that the smell of disaster would keep them away from the place for days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearness of their bodies to the cliff was what had saved them, that and the slight protection of the overhang below which the sea had bitten into the base of the cliff. They had been buried by the deluge of smaller stuff. The heavier chunks, any one of which would have crushed them, had fallen outwards, the nearest missing them by a few feet. And their nearness to the cliff was the reason for Bond’s right arm having been comparatively free so that they had been able to burrow out of the mound before they were stifled. Bond realized that if some reflex had not hurled him on top of Gala at the moment of the avalanche they would now both be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her hand on his shoulder. Without looking at her he put his arm round her waist and together they got down to the blessed sea and let their bodies fall weakly, thankfully into the shallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later it was two comparatively human beings who walked back up the sand to the rocks where their clothes lay, a few yards away from the cliff-fall. They were both completely naked. The rags of their underclothing lay somewhere under the pile of chalk dust, torn off in their struggle to escape. But, like survivors from a ship-wreck, their nakedness meant nothing. Washed clean of the cloying gritty chalk dust and with their hair and mouths scoured with the salt water, they felt weak and bedraggled, but by the time they had got their clothes on and had shared Gala’s comb there was little to show what they had been through. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moonraker-james-bond-3/page-22.html","bookId":2426,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:40:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:40:09 PM"}
