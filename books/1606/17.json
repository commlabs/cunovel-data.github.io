My eyes dart to Jack\u0027s son really quickly. He gets what I\u0027m saying, thank God, and nods, \"You hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo jumps into the truck, but I shake my head, \"You gotta stay with Sarah. She needs you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis yellow eyes get confused and sad for a minute. I shake my head again, swallowing the lump in my throat; I hate that I keep leaving him. His lip twitches, flashing me a fang. I smile, \"Don’t even give me that face. You gotta stay with Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at her as she wipes her face, and tries not to look at Will\u0027s still and bloody body. He makes his shitty wolf noise and gets out of the truck. His limp looks bad. I nod at Star, \"Check that leg, k?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"Be fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie passes them weapons. It dawns on me that we are near the place where I killed the infected and Will was in the tree. I shudder and drag my exhausted body closer to his lifeless one. I lift his still face into my lap and press my back into the back of the cab. Bernie and Anna jump in the front seat. I rifle Will\u0027s pockets, finding the crinkled pass in his back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck pulls away from the other half of us still standing on the dusty road, looking lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah drops to her knee, wrapping her arms around Leo\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish everything were different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment isn’t the same without Will there. I pace back and forth and wonder how Bernie lived in such a tight place before. The walls feel like they\u0027re closing in around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold myself and pace. Anna doesn’t move. She stares out the window, like she doesn’t know how to be in here either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the kitchen, grabbing some sandwiches that Bernie brought us. He got the stuff from the stores supply place. I eat because I should. I know that if I\u0027m going to be strong again, I need food. It’s the same reason that I eat when I come upon berries, even if I\u0027m not hungry, I know I need them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna watches out the window and then turns to see me eating. She nods and holds a hand out. I bring her two. She stuffs one in her mouth, chewing the whole thing and swallowing like a snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"You think it\u0027s close to being over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head and gets up. She comes back with water for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun sets in front of the huge window in the living room. It makes the odd-looking city appeared to be on fire with the orange light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach is a ball of nerves, and I have the worst feeling I can imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn’t seem like the way it should have gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods slowly, not looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like we should have found the creepy baby killers and killed them for Meg, then killed my dad, and then went and started over. I don’t even know how to make it right again. I don’t care about the babies, and the people, and the suffering.\" My words are cold and they burn my tongue a little, but that can\u0027t make me care. I just don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her, hating the dead stare on her face, like she knows he\u0027s dead and she\u0027s given up. I hate that I probably look like that too. I bite my lip and look out the window again, \"When it\u0027s over, whether he makes it or not, we give up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me hard, but I shake my head, \"We give up, we walk away, and we say screw this. I don’t wanna be some flashy crow, and I don’t wanna have the responsibility of the whole of what\u0027s left on my shoulders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe searches my face and nods, putting her pinky finger out like Meg always did. I wrap mine around it and shake them, \"We go home and make a new life, and say forget the rest of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t whisper or try to say anything. She isn’t a coward. She doesn’t take that path ever; it will be her first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I\u0027m done losing people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit on the odd couch that feels too stiff, like no one ever sat on it, and watch the sky get dark again, like it has for the three nights we\u0027ve been here. All I can do is pray that Jake, Star, and Jack\u0027s son, who I still have not formally met, are taking care of Leo and Sarah. I need that to be the case. I feel spread so thin that there isn’t room for me to worry about them too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens; it makes us both lift a revolver to the person walking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie\u0027s eyes are red and tired. He nods, \"He made it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and hug Anna. My eyes are closed, forcing tears back into them. Anna sighs over and over into my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to face him, \"What happened?\" We hadn’t seen Bernie since the first day we arrived. He brought us food and left again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs a sandwich and sits down on the other uncomfortable chair, \"Infection of the lung, pneumonia, so they had to drain it. He\u0027s been pumped full of every kind of antibiotic and other stuff. They have amazing technologies here; it\u0027s the only thing that saved him.\" He sighs, \"They have him in a drug-induced coma and on a respirator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna frowns, \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie shakes his head, \"He won\u0027t be leaving here for some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about his face, and the way he says it, makes me feel weird. I don’t say anything, I wait for him to continue; I know he\u0027s going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows his sandwich and leans over, taking Anna\u0027s water. He rubs his eyes, looking lost, \"They know he\u0027s a rebel. The doctors from the breeder farm he was once in remembered him. They were there; they recognized him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat feels swollen and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me, \"I told them I knew nothing of it and left him there in their custody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m frozen but Anna jumps up, her whisper screams are savage. She sounds like the infected have surrounded us. Her raw, high-pitch wheeze looses the words and neither of us knows what she is saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaps at Bernie, slapping and wheezing. He wraps himself around her, cradling her. He whispers back, trying to soothe her. She has finally snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am still frozen, taking it all in, but there is a question I don’t understand, \"Why are they keeping him alive, if they know what he is?\" It comes out as a whisper, hollow and detached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie\u0027s eyes lift from Anna. He licks his lips and closes his eyes, \"They know who you are to him. Marshall made a deal to trade you and Will in for a pass to the city. He wanted in, not just because life was easier here, but also because he had plans to sabotage the breeder program from within. He knew the best way to kill the snake, was to cut the head off. Marshall made the deal for you and Will. He convinced them Will was the leader of the rebellion and the instigator of the attacks on the breeder farms. He told them he was Will\u0027s captive and the way Will originally escaped the breeder farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just keeps getting worse.The pile is so big I don’t have a solution for the things that are going wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get up and start pacing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they know I\u0027m here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"They don’t know what you look like. They assume like your father, but you don’t, actually. You look like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snaps around, \"You\u0027ve seen her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Yeah. Her picture is in the files—hers and Star\u0027s mom’s, and the other first ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t get my breath. It\u0027s getting caught in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna is running her hands over her face and shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands up, \"I need air, Bernie. I need air. I can\u0027t breathe in here. I need some air.\" I\u0027m about to panic. I can feel it. It\u0027s like the dead bodies in the bags are lying on top of me again. I can\u0027t get past them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie takes my hand and Anna\u0027s in his and pulls us out the front door. He drags us to the door with the stairs on it and pulls us inside of it. We walk up the stairs until we reach a door at the top. He opens it and holds it open. Warm air rushes me as I step out onto the roof of the building. I walk to the edge and breathe, like it\u0027s the first time in years, or ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind feels like it\u0027s coming from every direction. I can\u0027t help but close eyes and put my hands out, and let it overwhelm me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlans and ideas are forming fast in my head, moving like a chain over a gear. I push them away; fight or flight isn’t going to save me this time. I need to be smarter than my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at Bernie, \"What was Marshall\u0027s plan and how do you know it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a confused look, \"I was told Marshall\u0027s version he fed them, and I figured the rest out on my own. Marshall and Will escaped the breeder farm with a doctor named Herbert Langdon. Langdon died in the escape, but told Marshall that his brother Clyde worked in the city, for the planners. Will told me this years ago. We never thought much about it, not thinking we were going to destroy the city, or maybe just kill your dad. Long and short of it, I went to see Clyde. Marshall had him give him plans and weak points and a few other things. He said Marshall had a place in the city. Between Clyde and the doctor\u0027s stories, I have pieced it together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI process it and look out at the night settling in over the city, \"Did you tell Clyde, Marshall was dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs, \"No. That would be dumb. I told him we were here to put Marshall\u0027s plan into action. He told me to wait two days; that’s what he needed to evacuate the people on our side from the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him, \"He plans on destroying the city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna whispers, \"Then the bombs must be here already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie nods again, \"Yup. He must have everything here and be ready to roll. I assume it\u0027s all in his place. We just need to find where he lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Impossible. This place is massive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I have an in; I wrote the program to keep track of residents. It keeps track of health checkups and incidents. Everyone has a residence listed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost feels hopeful, but then I remember Will, \"How do we get Will out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"That’s the hitch. They expect you to come for him. They expect you to break into the city. They said the guards have been upped on the gates and the perimeters, and people in the streets are being checked.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-17.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
