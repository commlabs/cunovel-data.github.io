He can ride with you. We\u0027re on safe land now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started toward his horse, then stopped. \"Do all boys his age talk as much as he does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Alec\u0027s the first child I\u0027ve ever been around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re good with him,\" he said abruptly. \"You have a kind heart, Gillian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him walk away. The sun seemed to be following him. Beams of light shone down on his head and shoulders as he crossed the glen, and in the golden glow, her bronzed warrior looked as though he\u0027d been sculpted by God in the archangel Michael\u0027s image so that he, too, could fight the demons roaming the world. It was at that moment that she became aware of him in a way she never had before. Now she reacted as a woman, and she was consumed with a yearning so intense tears came into her eyes. Annie and Kevin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrummond\u0027s charming home suddenly came into her mind. She pictured their pretty little cottage, but in her fantasy, Kevin wasn\u0027t standing in the doorway, Brodick was, and he was beckoning her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaydreams were dangerous because they made her wish for things she could never have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milady, is something wrong?\" Liam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of his voice she jumped. \"No, nothing\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could question her further, she picked up her skirts and hurried to her horse. She couldn\u0027t get a proper grip with her left hand, and after trying twice without success, she gave up and called Brodick for assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudged his mount close, leaned down, and all but tossed her onto her mare\u0027s back. Robert lifted Alec into her lap and went to fetch his horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick?\" she whispered so the others wouldn\u0027t overhear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me that arrogance wasn\u0027t my greatest flaw. You had another imperfection in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d wondered how long it would take her to get around to asking him that question and had to force himself not to laugh. \"You have many flaws,\" he announced. He swore he saw a spark of fire ignite in her emerald eyes as she straightened her shoulders. The lass had a temper, and he found that flaw quite pleasing. \"But there was one flaw that made all the other imperfections pale in comparison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was?\" she asked. \"I don\u0027t have this flaw any longer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray tell,\" she muttered in exasperation, \"what was this terrible flaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You used to be English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian felt as though she\u0027d entered another world. Even the sunset seemed different in the Highlands. The sky had turned into a brilliant canvas filled with broad, sweeping strokes of gold and splashes of orange. The center of the sun was a bold red, unlike any color Gillian had ever seen before, and she knew tomorrow the palette would be just as magnificent. God, she thought, surely favored this land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gillian, you know what? I\u0027m almost home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must be close,\" she replied. \"We\u0027ve climbed almost to the top of the mountain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec yawned loudly. \"Tell me the story again when you scared your uncle Morgan and made him scream,\" he pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you that story at least five times now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I want to hear it again. Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You close your eyes and rest and I\u0027ll tell you the story again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec cuddled up against her chest and yawned once more. \"I\u0027m ready now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was a little girl—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t talk for a whole long year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy obviously had memorized the story. \"Yes, that\u0027s right. I didn\u0027t speak for almost a full year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick slowed his mount and waited until Gillian was even with him. He\u0027d heard what she\u0027d said to Alec and was curious to know the rest of the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you went to live with your Uncle Morgan, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you got to tell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One night I had a terrible nightmare—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the nightmares I sometimes have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"My lady\u0027s maid, Liese, woke me up so I\u0027d stop screaming, and as was her habit, she held me in her lap and rocked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then she almost dropped you on top of your head \u0027cause you finally talked to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the bad man who told you you killed your sister lied \u0027cause Liese said you didn\u0027t kill her. He was being mean, but you know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Brodick will make him sorry he was mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassed because she knew Brodick could hear what the child was saying, she hastily continued the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was very happy to learn that Christen was alive, but then I also worried that she might be lost. Liese told me not to fret about my sister because she was certain my Uncle Morgan would help me find her. She said that all I needed to do was ask him. She meant for me to wait until morning, but I surprised her when I jumped off her lap and went running to my uncle\u0027s chamber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Cause it was the middle of the night, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec started giggling because he knew what was coming and he could hardly contain himself. His shoulders shook as he covered his mouth with one hand and eagerly waited, his eyes twinkling with anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liese tried to stop me, but she wasn\u0027t fast enough, and she couldn\u0027t chase me into my uncle\u0027s private chamber. I ran to the side of his bed, climbed up on the platform, and poked him in the ribs to get him to wake up. He was in such a deep sleep, he was snoring, and no matter how hard I poked and prodded, I couldn\u0027t get him to open his eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story captured Brodick\u0027s attention, but he wasn\u0027t sure if it was because of the way she told the tale or if it was Alec\u0027s reaction that so amused him. The child could hardly sit still in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what did you do?\" Alec demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know very well what I did. I\u0027ve told you this story so many times you know it better than I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you got to tell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouted at the poor man and gave him quite a fright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec burst into raucous laughter. \"And then he screamed, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my, yes, he screamed all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you screamed, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Yes, I did. Poor Uncle was so startled, he leapt up and grabbed his sword, but his feet got all tangled up in the covers, and he fell out of bed and rolled all the way down the platform. And that\u0027s the end of the story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you got to tell how you followed him around everywhere he went, talking and talking and talking all the day long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just told it,\" she said. \"Uncle told me that for the year I didn\u0027t speak he would pray every night that I would one day say his name—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But when you started talking and you wouldn\u0027t stop, that\u0027s when he started praying for a little peace and quiet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. \"You know, Alec, when you get home, there\u0027s going to be quite a lot of excitement, and I doubt you\u0027ll get to bed early tonight. Why don\u0027t you close your eyes and rest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYawning, he wrapped his arms around her waist. \"Gillian?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too, honey bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy was clearly worn out and fell asleep minutes later. It was blissfully silent as they continued the steep climb up the side of the mountain. Every once in a while, Brodick would turn back and look at her, a puzzled expression on his face, as though he were trying to work something out in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind picked up, a brittle cold wind that felt as if it were slicing through her bones. She felt Alec shiver and wrapped the plaid around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight of the child against her left arm soon became unbearable, and she finally asked Brodick for help. Alec was so exhausted he didn\u0027t wake up as he was transferred onto his uncle\u0027s lap. The tenderness in Brodick\u0027s eyes as he carefully placed the child\u0027s head against his chest made her think of her uncle Morgan and how he used to hold her on his lap while he told her bedtime stories, and she was suddenly so homesick and scared she wanted to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick caught her watching him. \"Alec will get an ache in his ear if you don\u0027t cover his head,\" she blurted to cover her embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the plaid over Alec\u0027s head but kept his attention centered on Gillian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What has you so worried, lass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" she lied. \"I was thinking…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking about what?\" he prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d moved so close, his leg rubbed against hers. She pretended not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me,\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I was thinking that when you marry and have children, you will make a fine father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think I don\u0027t already have children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. \"But you\u0027re not married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"A man need not be married to father children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that, she replied, trying her best to sound worldly. \"I\u0027m not completely ignorant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are completely innocent, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, sir, is none of your affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheeks had turned bright pink with embarrassment. She was a delight to observe, he thought, and a sure temptress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you were teasing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to require an answer to her statement, and so he gave her a quick nod before he nudged his mount and took over the lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later she heard the sound of thunder and the ground began to tremble. Stephen, Aaron, Liam and Robert all moved forward to circle her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protect Alec and your laird,\" she ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milady, we\u0027re on Maitland land now. There isn\u0027t any danger,\" Stephen explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are the four of you pressing in on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert grinned. \"We\u0027re just letting the Maitlands know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what, Robert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t inclined to explain. The Maitland soldiers crashed through the trees then and surrounded them. The noise startled Gillian\u0027s mare. Before she could calm the horse, Liam grabbed hold of the reins and forced the mare\u0027s head down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were encircled by warriors, and their closeness became oppressive. They were at least forty in number, and every one of them looked grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne soldier broke through the line and rode forward to speak to Brodick. There was something vaguely familiar about the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked Liam, \"Is that soldier angry with your laird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, milady,\" he answered. \"His name is Winslow, and he always frowns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winslow is Iain Maitland\u0027s commander in arms,\" Stephen told her. \"He\u0027s also Brodick\u0027s brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder he seemed so familiar to her, for now she could see the resemblance in the brother\u0027s coloring and piercing eyes. Winslow even frowned like Brodick, she thought, when the Maitland commander turned toward her, narrowed his eyes, and said something to his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen deliberately nudged his mount closer to Gillian on one side and Liam squeezed closer on her other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winslow wants to know who you are, milady,\" Robert whispered from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Brodick shrug as though she were so unimportant to him he couldn\u0027t remember who she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s the way it should be, she thought to herself. She wasn\u0027t important to him; she was simply a means to an end. For a short time, she and Brodick had a united goal of getting an innocent child back to his family. But now they were on Maitland land, and soon their duty would be over. Alec would be with his parents again, Brodick would no doubt go home, and she would begin her search for her sister. Her mind understood that their time together was over, yet her heart ached with regret. It was logical that Brodick would return to his duties as laird over the Buchanans… and it was right. Why, then, did she feel so alone? Gillian didn\u0027t need him, or any other man… except her uncle, of course. Uncle Morgan was her family, and when her quest was over, if she succeeded, she would return to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she would never forget Brodick… or the spontaneous kiss he\u0027d given her that had meant nothing to him and everything to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinslow caught her attention when he once again glanced her way and frowned with obvious displeasure. She heard him say the word \"English\" and assumed he was angry because Brodick had brought an outsider to the Maitlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick\u0027s response was severe, but he spoke so rapidly, Gillian couldn\u0027t catch a single word. Whatever he said seemed to placate his brother, though, because he backed down and reluctantly nodded. Then Brodick lifted the blanket away from Alec\u0027s face. Winslow was so stunned he let out a shout. Alec immediately woke up, pushed the plaid down, and sat up straight, smiling as the Maitland soldiers moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the men began to hoot and holler, making such a ruckus Gillian\u0027s ears rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec loved the attention. He gleefully waved to his father\u0027s soldiers, then turned in Brodick\u0027s lap to look back at Gillian. Alec\u0027s joy was wonderful to see, and she knew that she would never forget this wonderful moment. Thank you, God, she prayed, for getting this child home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian\u0027s radiant expression took Brodick\u0027s breath away, and when she looked at him and smiled, she made him feel invincible. How could one woman have such an impact on him in such a short time? He felt as though his world had been changed forever, and, honest to God, he didn\u0027t know if he liked that one bit. Gillian was a disruption—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain\u0027s on his way back from the training fields,\" Winslow said, breaking into his brother\u0027s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should prepare him,\" Brodick said. \"It\u0027s bound to be a shock having a son return from the dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinslow laughed. \"A joyous shock,\" he remarked before leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maitland soldiers tried to press in on Gillian, which the Buchanan soldiers took immediate exception to, and had Brodick not put an end to the budding hostility, Gillian was certain a real fight would have broken out. Angry words and hard shoves were exchanged, but no real damage was done. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-21.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
