{"id":75428,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate YOUR making time to see me, Monsignor. Tess took a seat in the front of Logan\u0027s desk and had a quick, not entirely comfortable flash of how her patients must feel during their initial consultation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my pleasure.\" He was settled comfortably, his tweed jacket draped over the back of his chair, his shirtsleeves rolled up to reveal sturdy forearms sprinkled with hair just beginning to gray. She thought again that he seemed to be a man more accustomed to the rugby field or racquetball court than vespers and incense. \"Would you like some tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nothing, thank you, Monsignor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since we\u0027re colleagues, why don\u0027t you call me Tim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She smiled, ordering herself to relax, starting with her toes. \"That would make things easier. My call to you today was on impulse, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When a priest is troubled, he seeks out another priest. When an analyst is troubled...\" As he trailed off, Tess found her conscious effort to relax was working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\" The fingers on her purse loosened their grip. \"I guess that means you get hit from both ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It also means I have two roads to choose from when I have problems of my own. That\u0027s a matter which has its pros and cons, but you didn\u0027t come to discuss Christ versus Freud. Why don\u0027t you tell me what\u0027s troubling you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this point, a number of things. I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027ve found the key to the mind of... of the man the police are looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think you should have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think being as involved as I am now, I should have more.\" She lifted one hand in a gesture that spoke of frustration and uncertainty. \"I\u0027ve talked to him three times. It bothers me that I can\u0027t get through my own fear, maybe my own self-interest, to push the right buttons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you know those buttons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my job to know them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tess, we both know the psychotic mind is a maze, and the routes leading to the core can shift and shift again. Even if we had him under intensive therapy in ideal conditions, it might take years to find the answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know. Logically, medically, I know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But emotionally is a different story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotionally. She dealt with other people\u0027s emotions on a daily basis. It was different, and much more difficult, she discovered, to open her own to someone else. \"I know it\u0027s unprofessional, and that worries me, but I\u0027m past the point where I can be objective. Monsignor Logan-Tim-that last woman who was killed was meant to be me. I saw her in that alley. I can\u0027t forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were kind, but she saw no pity in them. \"Transferring guilt won\u0027t change what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that too.\" She rose and went to the window. Below, a group of students rushed across the grass to make their next class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask you a question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally. I\u0027m in the answer business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it bother you that this man may be, or may have been, a priest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On a personal level, you mean, because I\u0027m a priest?\" To consider it, he sat back with his hands steepled. As a young man he\u0027d boxed both in and out of the ring. His knuckles were fat and spread. \"I can\u0027t deny a certain discomfort. Certainly the idea of the man being a priest rather than, say, a computer programmer, makes the entire business more sensational. But the simple truth is that priests are not saints, but as human as a plumber, a right fielder, or a psychiatrist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he\u0027s found, will you want to treat him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I were asked,\" Logan said slowly. \"If I believed I could be of use, then perhaps. I wouldn\u0027t feel obliged or responsible, as I believe you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, the more afraid I am, the more essential it becomes to me to help him.\" She turned to the window again. \"I had a dream last night. A rather dreadful one. I was lost in these corridors, this maze, and I was running. Even though I knew I was dreaming I was still terrified. The walls became mirrors and I could see myself over and over again.\" Unconsciously she put a hand to the glass of the window, as she had to the mirror in the dream. \"I was carrying my briefcase, dragging it really, because it was so heavy. I looked in one of the mirrors and it wasn\u0027t my reflection, but Anne Reasoner\u0027s. Then she was gone and I was running again. There was a door. I just had to get on the other side of that door. When I got there, it was locked. I looked frantically for the key, but I didn\u0027t have it. Then the door opened on its own. I thought I was safe. I thought- then I saw the priest\u0027s frock and the amice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back, but couldn\u0027t bring herself to sit. \"Oh, I could sit down and write a very detailed and comprehensive analysis of that dream. My fear of being out of control in this situation, overwork, and my refusal to cut down on that workload. Guilt over Anne Reasoner. My frustration at not finding the key to this case and my ultimate, my very ultimate failure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t mentioned fear for her life. Logan considered it a very interesting and telling omission. Either she had not yet brought herself to face it, or she linked the possibility with her dread of failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so sure you\u0027re going to fail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and I detest the idea.\" The admission brought a self-depreciating smile. Tess ran her fingers over the cover of the antique bible and found the carving deep and smooth. \"There\u0027s something in here about pride going before a fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tend to think that depends on the pride. You\u0027ve given the police everything a trained psychiatrist could, Tess. You haven\u0027t failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never have, you know. Not really. Not on a personal level. I did well in school, played hostess very properly for my grandfather until my practice cut back on my free time. As far as men were concerned, after one minor disaster in college I always made sure I called the shots. Things have been very safe and tidy until... well, until a few months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tess, as far as this case is concerned, you were brought in as a consultant. It\u0027s the police department\u0027s responsibility to find this man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I could have left it at that. Maybe,\" she murmured, running a hand through her hair. \"I\u0027m not totally sure. But now, how can I? He\u0027s turned to me. When he spoke to me, there was a desperation, a plea. How could I, how could any doctor try not to answer that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treating him at some later date isn\u0027t the same thing as feeling responsible for the results of his illness.\" A frown of concern entered his eyes as he linked his fingers and rested them on the desk. \"If I had to speculate out of hand, before a thorough reading of this report, I would say he\u0027s drawn to you because he senses compassion, and a certain vulnerability. You have to be careful not to give so much of the first that you fall victim to the second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s difficult for me to follow the rules on this one. Ben- Detective Paris-wanted me to go out of town. When he suggested it, for a minute I thought, I\u0027ll go. I\u0027ll get on a plane and go down to, I don\u0027t know, Mazatlan, and when I come back this will all be over and my life will be as neat and tidy as it used to be.\" She paused and met Logan\u0027s quiet, patient gaze. \"I really detest myself for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you consider it a normal reaction to the stress of the situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a patient,\" she said, and smiled. \"Not for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is such a thing as overachievement, Tess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t smoke. I\u0027m a very light drinker.\" She came back to sit. \"I figure I\u0027m entitled to a vice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have sex,\" Logan said contemplatively. \"I suppose that\u0027s why I feel entitled to smoke and drink.\" He looked back, pleased that she seemed more at ease. Confession, he knew well, was good for the soul. \"So you\u0027re staying in Georgetown and cooperating with the police. How do you feel about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nervous,\" she told him immediately. \"It\u0027s an uneasy feeling to know someone\u0027s watching you all the time. I don\u0027t mean just-\" Shaking her head, she broke off. \"I have such a difficult time knowing what to call him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most people would call him a killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but he\u0027s also a victim. In any case, it\u0027s not just knowing he might be watching that unnerves me. It\u0027s knowing the police are. At the same time I feel satisfied that it\u0027s the right thing. I didn\u0027t cut and run. I want to help this man. It\u0027s become very important to me to help him. In the dream, when I was faced with him I fell apart. Therefore I failed him and myself. I\u0027m not going to let that happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think you will.\" Logan picked up his letter opener, running the hilt through his hands. It was old and a bit tacky, a souvenir from a trip to Ireland during his youth. He was fond of it, as he was of many foolish things. Though he didn\u0027t consider Tess foolish, he was becoming fond of her as well. \"Tess, I hope you don\u0027t take offense if I suggest that after all this is over, you do get away for a while. Stress and overwork can break even the strongest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t take offense, but I might take it as doctor\u0027s orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good girl. Tell me, how is Ben?\" When she gave him a blank stare, he smiled. \"Oh, come, even a priest can smell romance in the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you could say Ben is another problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romance is supposed to be a problem.\" He put the letter opener down. \"Are you calling the shots this time, Tess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t seem as though either of us is. We\u0027re just fumbling around. He-I think we care for each other a great deal. We just haven\u0027t gotten around to trusting each other yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust takes time if it\u0027s going to be solid. I\u0027ve had a couple of professional discussions with him, and one rather drunken meeting at a little bar downtown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? He didn\u0027t mention it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear, a man doesn\u0027t like to mention he got drunk with a priest. In any case, would you like my opinion of Detective Paris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I think I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say he\u0027s a very good man, dependable. The kind of man who probably calls his mother once a month even when he\u0027d rather not. Men like Ben bend rules but very rarely break them, because they appreciate structure, they understand the concept of law. There\u0027s an anger in him he keeps well buried. He didn\u0027t give up the Church because of laziness, but because he found too many flaws. He gave up the Church, Tess, my dear, but he\u0027s Catholic right down to his toes.\" Tim sat back, pleased with himself. \"Sixty-second analysis is my speciality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe it.\" She pulled a file out of her briefcase. \"I hope you have as much luck with this. I cleared it with Captain Harris. This is my updated report. You\u0027ll also find the transcripts of my phone calls. I\u0027d appreciate a miracle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any time.\" He rose to go to the door with her. \"Tess, if you have any more nightmares, give me a call. It never hurts to ask for a little help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have I heard that before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan watched her go through the outer office before he closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her exit the building. It was dangerous to follow her, but he knew the time for caution was almost over. She paused by her car, looking for her keys. Her head was bent, as if in prayer. The need billowed up inside him until his head rang. Groping, he found the white silk in his coat pocket. Cool, soft. It steadied him. Tess pushed the key into the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was quick enough, sure enough, it could be over in minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers clutched and undutched on the amice while his heart thudded in his throat. A few forgotten leaves, dry as dust, rustled around her ankles. He saw the wind blow wisps of hair around her face. She looked troubled. Soon, very soon, she would be at peace. They would all be at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her get into her car, heard the door close, then the sound of the engine. A puff of smoke spurted out of the tailpipe. The car made a gentle sweep of the parking area, then turned onto the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited until the police car made the turn before he went to his own car. She would go to her office now, and he would continue the vigil. The moment hadn\u0027t arrived. There was still time to pray for her. And himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess hung up the phone, leaned back in her chair, and shut her eyes. She was batting about.500. In her game, that wasn\u0027t nearly good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoey Higgins. How could she treat the boy if she couldn\u0027t talk to him? His mother had taken a stand. Joey was no longer drinking, therefore, Joey was fine and no longer needed the embarrassment of a psychiatrist. It had been a painful and ultimately fruitless conversation. She had one more shot. She had to make it good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, Tess buzzed her secretary. \"Kate, how much time do I have before the next appointment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Please get Donald Monroe on the line for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she waited, Tess looked over Joey\u0027s file. Their last session remained very clear in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dying\u0027s not such a big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that, Joey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Cause it\u0027s not. People are always dying. You\u0027re supposed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deaths inevitable, but that doesn\u0027t make it an answer. Even very old people, very sick people, cling to life because it\u0027s precious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People say when someone dies, they\u0027re at peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and most of us believe there is something after life. But each of us is here for a reason. Our life is a gift, not always easy, certainly not always perfect. Making it better for ourselves and for the people around us takes some effort. What\u0027s your favorite thing to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a blank look. \"Spaghetti, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meat balls or meat sauce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile was quick, but it was there. \"Meat balls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose you\u0027d never tasted spaghetti and meat balls. The sky would probably still be blue, Christmas would still come once a year, but you\u0027d be missing something pretty terrific. And if you weren\u0027t here, say you\u0027d never been born, we\u0027d still have the sky and Christmas, but something pretty terrific would be missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer buzzer brought her back to the present. \"Mr. Monroe on one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Kate. Mr. Monroe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court. Is there a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mr. Monroe, I feel there\u0027s a big problem. I\u0027m strongly opposed to Joey withdrawing from treatment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Withdrawing? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Monroe, are you aware that Joey missed his last session?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause before she caught just a whisper of a weary sigh. \"No. I suppose he decided to take off on his own. I\u0027ll discuss it with Lois.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Monroe, I\u0027ve already spoken to your wife. She\u0027s decided to take Joey out of therapy. I take it you weren\u0027t informed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wasn\u0027t.\" Another pause, then he drew a long breath. \"Dr. Court, Lois wants Joey to resume a normal life, and he does seem a great deal better. We told him about the baby, and his reaction was encouraging. He\u0027s going to help me paint the nursery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to hear that, Mr. Monroe. My feeling is, however, that he\u0027s far from ready to pull out of therapy. In fact, I still believe he would be helped a great deal by some time in the clinic we discussed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lois is completely opposed to the clinic. I\u0027m sorry, Dr. Court, and I do appreciate your concern, but I have to back her on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger surged, barely controlled. Couldn\u0027t he see it was the boy he had to back up? That they both had to back up? \"I understand that you feel you should show Joey a united front. But, Mr. Monroe, I can\u0027t stress enough how vital it is for Joey to continue to receive consistent professional help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, Dr. Court, there\u0027s also the risk of overanalyzing. Joey isn\u0027t drinking, he isn\u0027t hanging around with the same crowd he was when he was drinking. He hasn\u0027t even mentioned his father in two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last statement had alarm bells ringing in her head. \"The fact that he hasn\u0027t mentioned his father only means he\u0027s repressing his feelings. His emotional state at this point is very tenuous. Can you understand, when there is little self-esteem, suicide becomes almost easy? I\u0027m afraid-no, I\u0027m terrified of what he might do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court, I can\u0027t help but think you\u0027re overreacting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise you, I\u0027m not. Mr. Monroe, I don\u0027t want to see Joey become a statistic. What I want, more than anything, is for his therapy to stop, when he\u0027s ready. Its both my professional opinion and my gut instinct that he\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see if I can convince Lois to bring him back for another session.\" But even as he said it, Tess recognized the dismissal. Some other boy might slash his wrists or swallow a bottle of pills, but not Joey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Monroe, has anyone asked Joey if he wants to continue seeing me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court, I can only promise to look into this.\" Impatience came through now, with a trace of annoyance. \"I\u0027ll use whatever influence I have to see that Joey comes back for at least one more session. I think you\u0027ll see for yourself how much better he is. You\u0027ve been very helpful, Doctor, but if we feel Joey is well, then the sessions should be stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, before you do anything, would you get a second opinion? Perhaps you\u0027re right not to take my word for it. I can recommend several excellent psychiatrists in the area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll talk to Lois. We\u0027ll consider it. Thank you, Dr. Court, I know you\u0027ve helped Joey a great deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough, she thought as the connection broke. Not nearly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court. Mr. Grossman is here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Kate. Send him in.\" She took Joey\u0027s file, but didn\u0027t put it away. Instead she set it aside on her desk, within easy reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearly five when the last patient left for the day. Kate stuck her head in the door. \"Dr. Court, Mr. Scott didn\u0027t schedule his next appointment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t need one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Kate relaxed against the door. \"You did good work there, Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to think so. You can take his file out of current patients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it tomorrow, Kate. If you hurry you can get out of here exactly one minute early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch me. Good night, Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Kate.\" When the phone rang she reached for it herself. \"I\u0027ve got it. Go on home, Kate.\" With her hand on the receiver, she took a long breath. \"Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben.\" A layer of tension dissolved. She heard background noises of phones, voices, and typewriters. \"Still at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I wanted you to know I\u0027d be a while yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound tired. Did something happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the day he\u0027d put in and the stench he wasn\u0027t sure would ever wash off his skin. \"It\u0027s been a long one. Look, why don\u0027t I pick up some pizza or something? Things should be wrapped up here in another hour or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Ben, I\u0027m a good listener.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep that in mind. Go straight home and lock the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you later, smartass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until she hung up that Tess realized how quiet the office was. Normally she would have appreciated an hour in the evening to herself. Her desk could be put in order, paperwork could be finished up. Now the quiet seemed too close and too thick. Calling herself a fool, she picked up the Scott file to close it out. Success was satisfying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the files and tapes from her late-afternoon patients and locked them away. Joey Higgins\u0027s file remained on her desk. Knowing she was spinning her wheels, Tess put it in her briefcase to take home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree times she caught herself looking toward her door with her pulse throbbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculous. Determined not to be a fool, she checked the next day\u0027s appointments. There were two policemen outside, she reminded herself, and one in the lobby. She was perfectly safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut each time she heard the elevator hum in the hall outside, she felt a jolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she went home now, the apartment would be empty. She didn\u0027t want to face solitude there now, not now that she was sharing the apartment with Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she getting into? Sighing, she began to gather the rest of her things. She was over her head with Ben Paris. Just how did the eminent Dr. Court deal with falling in love? Very poorly, she decided as she went to the closet for her coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were spring, she\u0027d have an excuse for daydreaming and smiling at nothing in particular. Smart people fell in love in spring, she thought, when everything was fresh and seemed as though it would stay that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped at the window. The trees that marched along the street in front of the buildings were dark and naked. What patches of grass could be seen were already yellowed and tired. People huddled inside their coats, heads bowed against the wind. It wasn\u0027t spring, she thought, feeling foolish. And everyone\u0027s hurrying home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw him. He stood very still in his black coat, just in back of a group of young trees. Her breath caught. Her knees trembled. Watching-he was waiting and watching. Instinctively, she swung around for the phone, grabbing it from her desk. She\u0027d call downstairs, she thought as she began to punch buttons. She\u0027d call and tell the police that he was outside, watching. Then she\u0027d go down too. She\u0027d go because she\u0027d promised herself that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she turned back to look, he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood there a moment, the phone in her hand, the number half dialed. He was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust someone on his way home, Tess told herself. A doctor or lawyer or bank executive walking home to keep fit. She forced herself to walk back to her desk and calmly replace the phone. She was jumping at shadows. Because her legs were still unsteady, she sat on the edge of the desk. Layer by layer she rebuilt control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiagnosis, acute paranoia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrescription, hot bath and quiet evening with Ben Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling better, she drew on her cashmere coat, hefted her briefcase, and tossed her purse strap over her shoulder. After locking her office, she turned and saw the knob on the reception-area door turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe keys in her hand slipped out of nerveless fingers. She took a step back into the door she\u0027d just locked. The door opened an inch. The scream backed up in her throat, bubbling hot. Frozen, she stared as the door opened a bit more. There was no maze to run through, no place to go. She took a deep breath, knowing she was on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anybody home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus, Frank.\" Her knees felt like butter as she braced herself against her office door. \"What are you doing sneaking around the halls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was walking down to the elevator and saw the light under your door.\" He smiled, delighted to find her alone. \"Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re taking work home again, Tess.\" He stepped inside, strategically closing the outer door at his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I keep my laundry in here.\" She bent to retrieve her keys, furious enough with herself to let him feel the backlash. \"Look, Frank, I\u0027ve had a long day. I\u0027m not in the mood for your fumbling attempts at seduction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Tess.\" His eyes widened, and so did his smile. \"I had no idea you could be so... so aggressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t get out of my way, you\u0027re going to get a close-up view of the nap of this carpet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for God\u0027s sake.\" She pushed past him, took hold of the freshly pressed sleeve of his jacket, and yanked him into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner at my place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting her teeth, Tess switched off the light, closed the door, and locked it. \"Frank, why don\u0027t you take your sexual delusions and write a book? It might keep you out of trouble.\" She whipped past him and punched the button for the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could be chapter one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a long breath, counted backward from ten, and discovered, to her amazement, that it did nothing to calm her. When the doors slid open she stepped inside, turned, and blocked the opening. \"If you like the shape of your nose, Frank, don\u0027t try to get on this elevator with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about dinner and a hot tub?\" he said as the doors started to close. \"I know a great place for Chicken Kiev.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stuff it,\" she muttered, then leaned against the back wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nearly home before she started to laugh. It was possible, if she put her mind to it, to forget about the police car behind her, to block out the fact that on the third floor of her building cops were drinking coffee and watching the early news. A two-car accident on Twenty-third held her up an extra fifteen minutes but didn\u0027t spoil the mood she was building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was humming when she unlocked the door to her apartment. After wishing briefly that she\u0027d thought to pick up fresh flowers, she went straight to the bedroom and stripped. She chose the silk kimono again, then dumped a double shot of bubble bath under the stream of water pulsing into the tub. She took the time to put an album on the stereo. Phil Collins bounced out, happy to be alive and in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo was she, Tess thought as she lowered herself into the steaming water. And tonight she was going to enjoy every minute of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ben used his key to get in, he felt he was home. The furniture wasn\u0027t his, and he hadn\u0027t picked out the paintings, but he was home. The cardboard box was warm on the bottom, where he held it. He set it on the dining room table, on top of the linen placement he imagined had taken some little French nun the better part of a week to embroider, and wished he could crawl into bed and sleep around the clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the paper bag he carried next to the pizza before he stripped out of his coat and let it fall over the back of a chair. Peeling off his shoulder holster, he dropped it on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could smell her. Even here, barely three steps inside the door, he could smell her. Soft, subtle, elegant. Drawing her in, he found fatigue warring against a need he\u0027d yet to find a way to curb. Tess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back here. I\u0027m in the tub. I\u0027ll be out in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed her scent and the sound of water. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she glanced up at him, he believed he saw her color rise a bit. Funny lady, he thought as he moved over to sit on the edge of the tub. She could make a man pant in bed, but she blushed when he caught her in a bubble bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know how long you\u0027d be.\" She stopped herself from sinking farther under the cover of bubbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just had to tie up a few things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassment faded as quickly as it had come. \"It was a rough one, wasn\u0027t it? You look exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say it was one of the less pleasant days on the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the blood. Even in his business you didn\u0027t often see that much. \"No, not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up to reach over and touch his face. \"There\u0027s room in here for two, if you\u0027re friendly. Why don\u0027t you take Dr. Court\u0027s reliable prescription for overwork?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pizza\u0027ll get cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love cold pizza.\" She began to unbutton his shirt. \"You know, I had a rather strange day myself, ending with an invitation for Chicken Kiev and a hot tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He rose to unsnap his pants. The feeling that went through him was ugly, and unrecognizable to a man who\u0027d never experienced basic jealousy before. \"Doesn\u0027t seem too smart to turn that down for cold pizza and bubbles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More fool me for refusing an evening with the handsome, successful, and excruciatingly boring Dr. Fuller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More your type,\" Ben muttered, sitting on the John to pull off his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boring\u0027s more my type?\" Tess lifted a brow as she leaned back. \"Thank you very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean the doctor, the three-piece suits, the Gold American Express Card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Amused, she began to soap her leg. \"You don\u0027t have a gold card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m lucky Sears still lets me charge my underwear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, in that case, I don\u0027t know if I should invite you into my tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, naked but for the jeans riding low at his hips. \"I\u0027m serious, Tess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see that.\" She took a handful of bubbles and studied them. \"I guess that means you see me as a shallow, materialistic, status-minded woman who\u0027s willing to slum it occasionally for good sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean anything like that.\" Frustrated, he sat on the lip of the tub again. \"Look, I\u0027ve got a job that means I deal with slime almost on a daily basis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand was wet and very gentle when she set it on his. \"It was a filthy day, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has nothing to do with it.\" He took her hand in his a moment, studying it. It was rather small and narrow, delicate at the wrist. \"My father sold used cars in a dealership that was barely on the right side of the tracks in the suburbs. He owned three sport coats and drove a DeSoto. My mother baked cookies. If a cookie could be baked, she did it. Their idea of a night on the town was the Knights of Columbus hall. I punched my way through high school, crammed my way through college for a couple of years then the Academy, and I\u0027ve spent the rest of my life looking at dead bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to convince me that you\u0027re not good enough for me because of cultural, educational, and genealogical differences?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start that shit with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Let\u0027s try another approach.\" She pulled him into the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you doing?\" He spit out bubbles. \"I\u0027m still dressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help it if you\u0027re slow.\" Before he could regain his bal-ance, she slid her arms around him and closed her mouth over his. Often, even a psychiatrist knows it\u0027s action rather than words that gets to the core. She felt the tension ebb and flow before he reached for her. \"Ben?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it\u0027s relevant, at the moment, that your father sold used cars and mine didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" She drew back, and laughing, brushed bubbles from his chin. \"Now, how are we going to manage to get your pants off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pizza was STONE cold, but they didn\u0027t leave a crumb. Ben waited until she\u0027d dumped the carton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought you a present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" Surprised, and foolishly pleased, she looked at the paper bag he offered. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Questions, always questions.\" Then he drew it back as she reached for it. \"You really want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved closer, close enough to slip an arm around her waist. The scent of the bath was on both of them. Her hair was pinned up and damp. \"Well, I think I\u0027m going out of my head. Yes, I think I\u0027m going out of my head, over you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let her eyes close slowly for the kiss. \"Little Anthony,\" she murmured, playing the tune over in her head. \"Was it 1961, \u002762?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured you being a shrink, you\u0027d fall for that approach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want your present?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm-hmm. But I think you have to let me go so I can open the bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then don\u0027t take too long.\" He gave it to her, watching her expression as she looked inside. It couldn\u0027t have been better-the blank frown, the surprise, then the amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dead bolt. God, Ben, you know how to sweep a woman off her feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s a real talent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips curved as she pressed them against his. \"I\u0027ll always treasure it. If it was a little less bulky, I\u0027d wear it next to my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be in your door in less than an hour. I put my tools in the kitchen closet the other day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Handy too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you see if there\u0027s something you can do for a while. Otherwise, I\u0027ll make you watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come up with something,\" she promised, and left him to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he worked, Tess edited a lecture she was to give at George Washington University the following month. The buzz of the drill and clank of metal against wood didn\u0027t disturb her. She began to wonder how she had ever tolerated the total silence of her life before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her lecture was in order and the files she\u0027d brought home dealt with, she turned to see him just finishing up. The lock looked bright and secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the door, held up a pair of keys, then set them on the table. \"Just use it. I\u0027ll put my tools away and wash up. You can sweep the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds fair.\" As she walked toward the door, she paused to turn on the television for the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough there seemed to be more mess than the small lock warranted, Tess swept the sawdust into the pan without complaint. She was straightening up, the pan and broom still in her hands, when the top story came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Police discovered the bodies of three people in an apartment in North West. Responding to the concern of a neighbor, police broke into the apartment late this afternoon. The victims had been stabbed repeatedly while bound with clothesline. Identified were Jonas Leery, Kathleen Leery, his wife, and Paulette Leery, their teenaged daughter. Robbery is thought to be the motive. We\u0027ll switch to Bob Burroughs on the scene for more details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA husky, athletic-looking reporter appeared on the screen, holding a microphone and gesturing at the brick building behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess turned and saw Ben just outside the kitchen doorway. She knew immediately that he\u0027d seen the inside of the building himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Ben, it must have been dreadful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d been dead ten, maybe twelve hours. The kid couldn\u0027t have been more than sixteen.\" The memory of it had the acid burning in his stomach. \"They\u0027d carved her up like a piece of meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" She set everything aside and went to him. \"Let\u0027s sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get to a point,\" he said, still watching the screen, \"you get to a point where it\u0027s almost, almost routine. Then you walk into something like that apartment today. You walk in and your stomach turns over. You think, God, it\u0027s not real. It can\u0027t be real because people can\u0027t do that kind of thing to each other. But you know, deep down, you know they can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Ben,\" she murmured, easing them both onto the couch. \"Do you want me to turn it off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" But he rested his head in his hands for a minute, then dragged them through his hair before he straightened. The on-the-scene reporter was talking to a weeping neighbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paulette used to baby-sit my little boy. She was a sweet girl. I can\u0027t believe this.
