The story of her deliverying a dead canary to the District Attorney\u0027s star witness was irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery television channel ahd pictures of Jennifer leaving Judge Waldman\u0027s chambers, fighting her way out of the courhouse, bedieged by the press and the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer could not believe the sudden horrifying publicity that was being showered on her. They wre hammering at her from all sides: television reporters, radio reporters and newspaper people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted desperately to flee from them, but her pride would not let her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who gave you the yellow canary, Miss Parker?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you ever met Michael Moretti?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did you know that Di Silva was planning to use this case to get into the governor\u0027s office?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The District Attorney says he\u0027s going to have you disbarred. Are you going to fight it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo each question Jennifer had a tight-lipped \u0027No comment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the CBS evening news they called her \u0027Wrong Way Parker,\u0027 the girl who had gone off in the wrong direction. An ABC newsman refered to her as the \u0027Yellow Canary.\u0027 On NBC, a sports commentator compared her to Roy Riegels, the football player who had carried the ball to his own team\u0027s one-yard line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Tony\u0027s Place, a restaurant that Michael Moretti owned, a celebration was taking place. There were a dozen men in the roo, drinking and boisterous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti sat alone at her car, in an oasis of silence, watching Jennifer Parker on television. He raised his glass in a salute to her and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawyers everywhere discussed the Jennifer Parker episode. Half of them believed she had been bribed by the Mafia, and the other half that she had been an innocent dupe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter which side they were on , they all concurred on one point: Jennifer Parker\u0027s short career as an attorney was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had lasted exactly four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been born in Kelso, Washington, a small timber town founded in 1847 by a homesick Scottish surveyor who named it for his home town in Scotland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s father was an attorney, first for the lumber companies that dominated the town, then later for the workers in the sawmills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s earliest memories of growing up were filled with joy. The state of Washington was a story book place for a child, full of spectacular mountains and glaciers and national parks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wre skiing and canoeing and, when she was older, ice climbing on glaciers and pack trips to places with wonderful names: Ohanapecosh and Nisqually and Lake CleElum and Chenuis Falls and Horse Heaven and the Yakima Valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer learned to climb on Mount Rainier and to ski at Timberline with her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father always had time for her, while her mother, beautiful and restless, was mysteriously busy and seldom at home. Jennifer adored her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbnew Parker was a mixture of English and Irish and Scottish blood. He was of medium height, with black hair and green-blue eyes. He was a compassionate man with a deep-rooted sense of justice. He was not interested in money, he was interested in people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would sit and talk to Jennifer by the hour, telling her about hte cases he was handling and the problems of the people who came into his unpretentious little office, and it did not occur to Jennifer until years later that he talked to her because he had no one else with whom to share things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school Jennifer would hurry over to the courthouse to watch her father at work. If court was not in session she would hang around his office, listening to him discuss his cases and his clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey never talked about her going to law school; it was simply taken for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer was fifteen she began spending her summers working for her father. At an age when other girls were dating boys and going steady, Jennifer was absorbed in lawsuits and wills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoys wre interested in her, but she seldom went out. When her father would ask her why, she would reply, \u0027 They\u0027re all so young, Papa.\u0027 She knew that one day she would marry a lawyer like her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Jennifer\u0027s sixteenth birthday, her mother left town with the eighteen-year-old son of their next-door neightbor, and Jennifer\u0027s father quietly died. It took seven years for his heart to stop beating, but he was dead from the moment he heard the news about his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole town knew and was sympathetic, and that, of course, made it worse, for Abnew Parker was a proud man. That was when he began to drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer did everything she could to comfort him but it was no use, and nothing was ever the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next year, when it came time to go to college, Jennifer wanted to stay home with her father, but he would not hear of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027re going into partnership, Jennie,\u0027 he told her. \u0027You hurry up and get that law degree.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was graduated she enrolled at the University of Washington in Seattle to study law. During the first year of school, while Jennifer\u0027s classmates were flailing about in an impenetrable swamp of contracts, torts, property, civil procedure and criminal law, Jennifer felt as though she had come home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved into the university dormitory and got a job at the Law Library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer loved Seattle. On Sundays, she and an Indian student named Ammini Williams and a big, rawboned Irish girl named Josephine Collins would go rowing on Green Lake in the heart of the city, or attend the Gold Cup races on Lake Washington and watch the brightly colored hydroplanes flashing by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were great jazz clubs in Seattle, and Jennifer\u0027s favorite was Peter\u0027s Poop Deck, where they had crates with slabs of wood on top instead of tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoons, Jennifer, Ammini and Josephine would meet at The Hasty Tasty, a hangout where they had the best cottage-fried potatoes in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two boys who pursued Jennifer: a young, attractive medical student named Noah Larkin and a law student named Ben Munro; and from time to time Jennifer would go out on dates with them, but she was far too busy to think about a serious romance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seasons were crisp and wet and windy and it seemed to rain all the time. Jennifer wore a green-and-blue-plaid lumber jacket that caught the rain drops in its shaggy wool and made her eyes flash like emerals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked through the rain lost in her own secret thoughts, secret knowing that all those she passed would file away the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spring the girls blossomed out in their bright cotton dresses. There were six fraternities in a row at the university, and the fraternity brothers would gather on the lawn and watch the girls go by, but there was something about Jennifer that made them feel unexpectedly shy. There was a special quality about her that was difficult for them to define, a feeling that she had already attained something for which they were still searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery summer Jennifer went home to visit her father. He had changed so much. He was never drunk, but neither was the ever sober. He had retreated into an emotional fortress where nothing could touch him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe died when Jennifer was in her last term at law school. The town remembered, and there were almost a hundred people at Abnew Parker\u0027s funeral, people he had helped and advised and befriended over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer did her grieving in private. She had lost more than a father. She had lost a teacher and a mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the funeral Jennifer returned to Seattle to finish school. Her father had left her less than a thousand dollars and she had to make a decision about what to do with her life. She knew that she coudl not return to Kelso to practice law, for there she would always be the little girl whose mother had run off with a teenager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of her high scholastic average, Jennifer had interviews with a dozen top law firms around the country, and received several offers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren Oakes, her criminal law professor, told her:\u0027That\u0027s a real tribute, young lady. It\u0027s very difficult for a woman to get into a good law firm.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s dilemma was that she no longer had a home or roots. She was not certain where she wanted to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly before graduation Jennifer\u0027s problem was solved for her. Professor Oakes asked her to see him after class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have a letter from the Districtt Attorney\u0027s office in Manhattan, asking me to recommend my brightest graduate for his staff. Interested?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York. \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 Jennifer was so stunned that the sanswer just popped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flew to New York to take the bar examination, and returned to Kelso to close her father\u0027s law office. It was a bittersweet experience, filled with memories of the past and it seemed to Jennifer that she had grown up in that office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got a job as an assistant in the law library of the university to tide her over until she heard whether she had passed the New York bar examination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s one of the toughest in the country,\u0027 Professor Oakes warned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jennifer knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe received her notice that she had passed and an offer from the New York District Attorney\u0027s office on the same day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne week later, Jennifer was on her way east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found a tiny apartment (Spc W/U fpl gd loc nds sm wk, the ad said) on lower Third Avenue, with a fake fireplace in a steep fourth-floor walk-up. The exercise will do me good, Jennifer told herself. There were no mountains to climb in Manhattan, no rapids to ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment consisted of a small living room with a couch that turned into a lumpy bed, and a tiny bathroom with a window that someone long ago had painted over with black paint, sealing it shut. The furniture looked like something that could have been donated by the Salvation Army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, well, I won\u0027t be living in this place long, Jennifer thought. This is just temporary until I prove myself as a lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been the dream. The reality aws that she had been in new York less than seventy-two house, had been thrown off the District Attorney\u0027s staff and was facing disbarment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer quit reading newspapers and magazines and stopped watching television, because wherever she turned she saw herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt that people were staring at her on the street, on the bus, and at the market. She began to hide out in her tiny apartment, refusing to answer the telephone or the doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about packing her suitcases and returning to Washington. She thought about gettig a job in some other field. She thought about suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent long hours composing letters to District Attorney Robert Di Silva. Half the letters were scathing indictments of his insensitivity and lack of understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other half were abjecct apologies, with a plea for him to give her another chance. None of the letters were ever sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in her life Jennifer was overwhelmed with a sense of desperation. She had no friends in New York, no one to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed locked in her apartment all day, and late at nigth she would slip out to walk the deserted streets of the city. The derelicts who peopled the night never accosted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps they saw their own loneliness and despair mirrored in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and over, as she walked, Jennifer would envision the courtroom scene in her mind, always changing the ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man detached himself from the group around Di Silva and hurried toward her. He was carrying a manila envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Parker?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief wants you to give this to Stela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at him coolly. Let me see your identification, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man panicked and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man detached himself from the group around Di Silva and hurried toward her. He was carrying a manila envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Parker?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief wants you to give this to Stela. He thrust the envelope into her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer opened the envelope and saw the dead canary inside. I\u0027m placing you under arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man detached himself from teh group around Di Silva and hurried toward her. He was carrying a manila envelope. He walked past her to another young assistant district attorney and handed him the envelope. The Chief wants you to give this to Stela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could rewrite the scene as many times as she liked, ut nothing was changed. One foolish mistake and destroyed her. And yet - who said she was destroyed? The press? Di Silva?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not heard another work about her disbarment, and until she did she was still an attorney. There are law firms that made me offes, Jennifer told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with a new sense of resolve, Jennifer pulled out the list of the firms she had talked to and began to make a series of telephone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of the men she asked to speak to was in, and not one of her calls was returned. It took her four days to realize that she was the pariah of the legal profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe furor over the case had died down, but everyone still remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer kept telephoning prospective emplyers, going from despair to indignation to frustration and back to despair again. She wondered what she was going to do with the rest of her life, and each time it came back to the same thing:All she wanted to do, the one thing she really cared about, was to practice law. She was a lawyer and , by God, until they stopped her she was going to find a way to practice her profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to make the rounds of Manhattan law offices. She would walk in unannounced, give her name to the recptionist and ask to see the head of personnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally she was granted an interview, but when she was, Jennifer had the feeling it was out of curosity. She was a freak and they wanted to see what she looked like in person. Most of the time she was simply informed there were no openings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of six weeks, Jennifer\u0027s money was running out. She would have moved to a cheaper apartment, but there were no cheaper apartments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to skip breakfast and lunch, and to have dinner at one of the little coner dinettes where the food was bad but the prices were good. She discovered the Steak \u0026amp; Brew and Roast-and-Brew, where for a modest sum she was able to get a main course, all the salad she could eat, and all teh beer she could drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer hated beer, but it was filling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer had gone through her list of large law firms, she armed herself with a list of smaller firms and began to call on them, but her reputation had preceded her even there. She received a lot of propositions from interested males, but no job offers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beginning to get desperate. All right, she thought defiantly, if no one wnats to hire me, I\u0027ll open my own law office. The catdch was that that took money. Ten thousand dollars, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would need enough for rent, telephone, a secretary, law books, a desk and chairs, stationery ... she could not even afford the stamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had counted on her salary from the District attorney\u0027s office but that, of course, was gong forever. She could forget about severance pay. She had not been severed; she had been beheaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, there was no way she could afford to open her own office, no matter hwo small. The answer was to find someone with whom to share offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer bought a copy of The New York Times and began to search through the want ads. It was not until she was near the bottom of the page that she came across a small advertisement that read: Wanted:/Prof man sh sm off w/2 oth/prof men. Rs rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last two words appealed to Jennifer enormously. She was not a professional man, but her sex should not matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tore out the ad and took the subway down to the address listed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dilapidated old building on lower Broadway. The office was on the tenth floor and the flaking sign on the door read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKENNETH BAILEY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eACE INVEST GA IONS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROCKEFELLER COLLECTION AG NCY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer took a deep breath, opened the door and walked in. She was standing in the middle of a small, windowless office. There were three scarred desks and chairs crowded into the room, two of them occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated at one of the desks was a bald, shabbily dressed, middle-aged man working on some papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagainst the opposite wall at another desk was a man in his early thirties. He had brick-red hair and bright blue eyes. His skin was pale and freckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed in tight-fitting jeans, a tee shirt, and white canvas shoes without socks. He was talking into the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t worry, Mrs Desser, I have two of my best operatives working on your case. We should have news of your husband any day now. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to ask you for a little more expense money... No don\u0027t bother mailing it. The mails are terrible. I\u0027ll be in your neighborhood this afternoon. I\u0027ll stop by and pick it up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replaced the receiver and looked up and saw Jennifer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose to his feet, smiled and held out a strong, firm hand. \u0027I\u0027m Kenneth Bailey. And what can I do for you this morning?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked around the small, airless room and said uncertainly, \u0027I - I came about your ad.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh.\u0027 There wa surprise in his blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe bald-headed man was staring at Jennifer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenneth Bailey said, \u0027This is Otto Wenzel. He\u0027s the Rockefeller Collection Agency.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer nodded. \u0027Hello.\u0027 She turned back to Kenneth Bailey. \u0027 And you\u0027re Ace Investigations?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s right. What\u0027s your scam?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My -?\u0027Then, realizing, \u0027I\u0027m an attorney.\u0027��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenneth Bailey studied her skeptically. \u0027And you want to set up an office here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked around the dreary office again and visualized herself at the empty desk, between these two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Perhaps I\u0027ll look a little further,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m not sure -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Your rent would only be ninety dollars a month.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I could buy this building for ninety dollars a month,\u0027 Jennifer replied. She turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hey, wait a minute.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenneth Bailey ran a hand over his pale chin. \u0027I\u0027ll make a deal with you. Sixty. When your business gets rolling we\u0027ll talk about an increase.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bargain. Jennifer knew that she could never find any space elsewhere fo rthat amount. On the other hand , there was no way she could ever attract clients to this hellhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one other thing she had to consider. She did not have the sixty dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll take it,\u0027 Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You won\u0027t be sorry,\u0027 Kenneth Bailey promised. \u0027When do you want to move your things in?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027re in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenneth Bailey panted the sign on the door himself. It read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJENNIFER PARKER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eATTORNEY AT LAW\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer studied the sign with mixed feelings. In her deepest depressions it had never occurred to her that she would have her name under that of a private investigator and a bill collector. Yet, as she looked at the faintly crooked sign, she could not help feeling a sense of pride. She was an attorney. The sign on the door proved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Jennifer had office space, the only thing she lacked was clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer could no longer afford even the Steak \u0026amp; Brew. She made herself a breakfast of toast and coffee on the hot plate she had set up over the radiator in her tiny bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ate no lunch and had dinner at Chock Full O\u0027Nuts or Zum Zum, where they served large pieces of wurst, slabs of bread and hot potato salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arrived at her sesk promptly at nine o\u0027clock every morning, but there was nothing for her to do except listen to Ken Bailey and Otto wenzel talking on the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey\u0027s cases seemed to consist mostly of finding runaway spouses and children, and at first Jennifer was convinced that he wa a con man, making extravagant promises and collecting large advances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jennifer quickly learned that Ken Bailey worked hard and delivered often. He was bright and he was clever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto Wenzel was an enigma. His telephone range constantly. He would pick it up, mutter a few words into it. write something on a piece of paper and disppear for a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oscar does repo\u0027s,\u0027 Ken Bailley explained to Jennifer one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Repo\u0027s?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yeah. Collection companies use him to get back automobiles, television sets, washing machines - you name it.\u0027 He looked at Jennifer curiously.\u0027You got any clients?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have some things coming up,\u0027 Jennifer said evasively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \u0027Don\u0027t let it get you down. Anyone can make a mistake.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer felt herself flushing. So he knew about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey was unwrapping a large, thick roast-beef sandwich.\u0027Like some?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked delicious. \u0027No, thanks,\u0027 Jennifer said firmly. \u0027 I never eat lunch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him bite into the juicy sandwich. He saw her expression and said, \u0027 You sure you - ?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, thank you. I - I have an appointment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey watched Jennifer walk out of the office and his face was thoughtful. He prided himself on his ability to read character but Jennifer Parker puzzled him. From the television and newspaper accounts he had been sure someone had paid this girl to destroy the case against Michael Moretti. after meeting Jennifer, Ken was less certain. He had been married once and had gong through hell, and he held women in low esteem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beautiful, bright and very proud. Jesus! he said to himself. Don\u0027t be a fool! One murder on your conscience is enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma Lazarus was a sentimental idiot, Jennifer though. \u0027Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free... Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed! Anyone manufacturing welcome mats in New York would have gone out of business in an hour. In New York no one cared whether you lived or died. Stop feeling sorry for yourself! Jennifer told herself. But it was difficult. Her resources ahd dwindled ot withteen dollars, the rent on her apartment was overdue, and her share of the office rent was due in two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not have enough money to stay in New York any longer, and she did not have enough money to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had gone through the Yellow Pages, calling law offices alphabetically, trying to get a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made the calls from telephone booths because she was too embarrassed to let Ken Bailey and Otto Wenzel hear her conversatins. The results were always the same. No one was interested in hiring her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to return to Kelso and get a job as a legal aide or as a secretary to one of her father\u0027s friends. How he would have hated that ! It was a bitter defeat, but there were no choices left. She would be returning home a failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immediate problem facing her was transportation. She looked through the afternoon New York ost and found an ad for someone to share driving expenses to Seattle. There wa a telephone number and Jennifer called it. There was no answer. She decided she would try again in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, Jennifer went to her office for the last time. Otto Wenzel was out, but Ken Bailey was there, on the telephone, as usual. He was wearing blue jeans and a veeneck cashmere sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I found your wife,\u0027 he was syaing. \u0027 The only problem, pal, is that she doesn\u0027t want to go home... I know. Who can figure wommen out?... Okay. I\u0027ll tell you where she\u0027s staying and you can try to sweet-talk her into coming back.\u0027 He gave the address of a midtown hotel. \u0027My pleasure.\u0027 He hung up and swung around to face Jennifer. \u0027 You\u0027re late this morning.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mr Bailey, I - I\u0027m afraid I \u0027m going to have to be leaving. I\u0027ll send you the rent money I owe you as soon as I\u0027m able to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey leaned back in his chair and studied her. His look made Jennifer uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Will that be all right?\u0027 she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Going back to washington?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey said, \u0027 Before you leave, would you do me a little favor? A lawyer friend\u0027s been buging me to serve some subpoenas for him, and I haven\u0027t got time. He pays twelve-fifty for each subpoena plus mileage. Would you help me out?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour later Jennifer Parker found herself in the plush law offices of Peabody \u0026amp; Peabody. This was the kind of firm she had visualized working in one day, a full partner with a beautiful corner suite. She was escorted to a small back room where a harassed secretary handed her a stack of subpoenas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Here. Be sure to keep a record of your mieage. You do have a car, don\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, I\u0027m afraid I -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, if you use the subway, keep track of the fates.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer spent the rest of the day delivering subpoenas in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens in a downpour. By eight o\u0027clock that evening, she had made fifty dollars. She arrived back at her tiny hadapartment chilled and exhausted. But at least she had earned some money, her first since coming to New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the secretary had told her there were plenty more subpoenas to serve. It was hard work, running all over town, and it was humiliating. She had had doors slammed in her face, had been cursed at, threatened, and propositioned twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe prospect of facig another day like that was dismaying; and yet, as long as she could remain in New York there was hope, no matter how faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer ran a hot bath and stepped into it, slowly sinking down into the tub, feeling the luxury of the water lapping \u003dover her body. She ahd not realized how exhausted hse was. Every muscle seemed to ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided that what she needed was a good dinner to cheer her up. She would splurge. I\u0027ll treat myself to a real restaurant with tablecloths and napkins, Jennifer thought. Perhaps they\u0027ll have soft music and I\u0027ll hae a glass of white wine and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. It was an alien sound. She had not had a single visitor since she had moved in two months earlier. It could only be the surly landlady about the overdue rent. Jennifer lay still, hoping she would go away, too weary to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang again. Reluctantly, Jennifer dragged herself from the warm but. She slipped on a terry-cloth robe and went to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who is it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA masculine voice on the other side of the door said, \u0027 Miss Jennifer Parker?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My name is Adam Warner. I\u0027m an attorney.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled, Jennifer put the chain on the door and opened it a crack. The man standing in the hall was in his middle thirties, tall and blond and broad-shouldered with gray-blue inquisitive eyes behind horn-rimmed glasses. He was dressed in a tailored suiut that must have cost a fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027May I come in?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuggers did not wear tailored suits, Gucci shoes and silk ties. Nor did they that long, sensitive hands with carefully manicured nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just a moment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer unfastened the chain and opened the door. As Adma warner walked in, Jennifer glanced his eyes, and winced. He looked like a man who was used to better things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What can I do for you, Mr Warner?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven as she spoke, Jennifer suddenly knew why he was there, and she was filled with a quick sense of excitement. It was about one of the jobs she had applied for! She wished that she had on a nice, dark blue tailored robe, that her hair was combed, that -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam warner said, \u0027 I\u0027m a member of the Disciplinary Committee of the New York Bar Association, Miss Parker. District Attorney Robert Di Silva and Judge Lawrence Waldman have requested the Appellate Division to begin disbarment proceedings against you.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-3.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:59 AM"}
