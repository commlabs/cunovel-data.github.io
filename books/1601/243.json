He reached up and felt the medallion at his neck. \"Take all of the men and go\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Lord Captain Commander?\" Golever asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will do what needs to be done\", Galad said, cold inside. Cold as winter steel. \"I will bring Light to the Shadow. I will bring justice to the Forsaken\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn’s thread of life vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene lurched to a stop on the battlefield. Something severed within her. It was as if a knife suddenly tore into her and scooped out the piece of Gawyn inside, leaving only emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed, falling to her knees. No. No, it couldn’t be. She could feel him, just ahead! She’d been running for him. She could . . . She could . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene howled, opening herself to the One Power and drawing in as much as she could hold. She let it out as a wall of flames toward the Sharans who were all around now. They had once held the Heights, the Aes Sedai below, but it was madness now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe assailed them with the Power, clutching Vora’s sa’angreal. She would destroy them! Light! It hurt. It hurt so badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother!\" Silviana cried, seizing her arm. \"You are out of control, Mother! You will kill our own people. Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene breathed in gasps. Nearby, a group of Whitecloaks stumbled by, carrying wounded down the hillside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo close! Oh, Light. He was gone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother?\" Silviana said. Egwene barely heard. She touched her face, and found tears there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been bold before. She had claimed she could keep fighting through the loss. How naive that was. She let the fire of saidar die within her. With that gone, life went out of her. She slumped to the side, and felt hands carrying her away. Through a gateway, off the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTam used his last arrow to save a Whitecloak. It wasn’t something he’d have ever imagined himself doing, but there he was. The wolfish Trolloc stumbled back with the arrow through its eye, refusing to go down until the young Whitecloak pulled himself from the mud and struck at its knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis men were now positioned on the catwalks of the palisade, shooting volleys of arrows at the Trollocs that had surged across the riverbed here. Their numbers were depleted, but there were still so many of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil this point, the battle had been going well. Tam’s combined forces spread out mightily along the river on the Shienaran side. Downriver the Legion of the Dragon, crossbow banners and heavy cavalry, stemmed the Trolloc advance. The same events were being played out here, farther upriver, with archers, foot soldiers and cavalry stopping the Trolloc incursion at the riverbed. Until the supplies began to dwindle and Tam was forced to withdraw his men to the relative safety of the palisade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTam looked to the side. Abell held up his bow, shrugging. He was out of arrows as well. All up and down the catwalk, the Two Rivers men held up their bows. No arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more will be coming\", Abell said softly. \"The lad said that batch was the last\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Whitecloak army fought desperately, mixed with members of Perrin’s Wolf Guard, but they were being pushed back from the riverbed in droves. They fought on three sides, and another force of Trollocs had just swung around to box them in entirely. The banner of Ghealdan flew closer to the ruins. Arganda held that position along with Nurelle and the remnants of the Winged Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this were any other battle, Tam would have had his men save their arrows to cover a retreat. There would be no retreat this day, and the order to loose had been the right one; the lads had taken their time with each shot. They’d likely killed thousands of Trollocs during the hours of fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was an archer without his bow? Still a Two Rivers man, Tam thought. And still not willing to let this battle be lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off the catwalks and form up with weapons\", Tam called to the lads. \"Leave the bows here. We will fetch them when more arrows come our way\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore arrows wouldn’t come, but the Two Rivers men would be happier pretending that they might go back to their bows. They formed up into ranks as Tam had taught them, armed with spears, axes, swords, even some scythes. Everything and anything they’d had on hand, along with shields for those with axes or swords and good leather armor for them all. No pikes, unfortunately. After the heavy infantry had been outfitted, there hadn’t been any of those left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay tight\", Tam said to them. \"Form into two wedges. We’ll push into the Trollocs around the Whitecloaks\". Best thing to do—at least, the best Tam could come up with—was to hit those Trollocs that had just come around the back of the Whitecloaks, fragment them and help the Whitecloaks break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men nodded, though they probably had very little understanding of the tactics. It didn’t matter. So long as they kept disciplined ranks as Tam had taught them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started forward, running, and Tam was reminded of another battlefield. Snow, cutting into his face, blown by terrible winds. In a way, that battlefield had begun this all. Now it ended here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTam placed himself at the point of the first wedge, then put Deoan—a man from Deven Ride who had served in the Andoran army—at the point of the other. Tam guided his men forward briskly, not letting them, or himself, dwell too much on what was about to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they approached the hulking Trollocs, with their swords, polearms and battle-axes, Tam sought the flame and the void. Nervousness vanished. All emotion evaporated. He unsheathed the sword Rand had given him, the one with the dragons painted on the sheath. It was as fine a weapon as Tam had ever seen. Those folds in the metal whispered of ancient origin. It seemed too good a weapon for Tam. He had felt that way about every sword he’d ever used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, hold formation!\" Tam yelled back at his men. \"Don’t let them break us apart. If someone falls, one man steps up and takes his place while another pulls the fallen man into the center of the wedge\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded back at him, and then they hit the Trollocs in the back, where they had surrounded the Children of the Light at the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis formations hit, pounding forward. The huge Trollocs turned to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona waved away the so’jhin who tried to replace her regal clothing. She smelled of smoke from the fire, and her arms had been burned and scored in several places. She would not accept damane Healing. Fortuona thought Healing to be a useful development—and some of her people were changing their attitudes toward it—but she was not certain the Empress should submit to it.
