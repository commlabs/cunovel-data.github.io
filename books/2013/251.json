His weapons had been taken, as had the vest of fine chain beneath the light tanned leather shirt. There was no sign of the Letherii’s horse. The buzz of the flies seemed preter-naturally loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar wheeled his mount round and guided it back up onto the ridge. He spoke to the Sollanta scout. ‘Tracks?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just his horse, Overseer,’ the warrior replied. ‘The ambusher was, I believe, on foot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl nodded. This had been the pattern. The Awl were collecting horses, weapons and armour. The Atri-Preda had since commanded that no outrider scout alone. To this Redmask would no doubt add more ambushers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Awl rode southeast, Overseer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDays ago, alas. There was no point in pursuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes narrowed against the harsh sunlight, Brohl Handar scanned the plain on all sides. How could a warrior hide in this empty land? The drainage gullies had seemed an obvious answer, and as soon as one was spotted a troop would dismount, advance on foot, and plunge into it seeking to flush out the enemy. All they had found were bedded deer and coyote dens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAreas of high grasses were virtually attacked, both mounted and on foot. Again, nothing but the occasional deer bolting almost from the feet of some startled, cursing soldier; or ptarmigan or thrushes exploding skyward in a flurry of feathers and drumming wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mages insisted that sorcery was not at work here; indeed, much of the Awl’dan seemed strangely bereft of whatever was necessary to shape magic. The valley known as Bast Fulmar had been, it was becoming clear, in no way unique. Brohl Handar had begun with the belief that the plains were but southern versions of tundra. In some ways this was true; in others it was anything but. Horizons deceived, distances lied. Valleys hid from the eye until one was upon them. Yet, so much like the tundra, a terrible place to fight a war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask and his army had disappeared. Oh, there were trails aplenty; huge swaths of trodden ground wending this way and that. But some were from bhederin herds; others were old and still others seemed to indicate travel in opposite directions, overlapping back and forth until all sense was lost. And so, day after day, the Letherii forces set out, their supplies dwindling, losing outriders to ambushes, marching this way and that, as if doomed to pursue a mythic battle that would never come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar had assembled thirty of his best riders, and each day he led them out from the column, pushing far onto the flanks-dangerously far-in hopes of sighting the Awl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe now squinted at the Sollanta scout. ‘Where have they gone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior grimaced. ‘I have given this some thought, Overseer. Indeed, it is all I have thought about this past week. The enemy, I believe, is all around us. After Bast Fulmar, Redmask split the tribes. Each segment employed wagons to make them indistinguishable-as we have seen from the countless trails, those wagons are drawn from side to side to side, eight or ten across, and they move last, thus obliterating signs of all that precedes them on the trail. Could be a hundred warriors ahead, could be five thousand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If so,’ Brohl objected, ‘we should have caught up with at least one such train.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We do not move fast enough, Overseer. Recall, we remained encamped on the south side of Bast Fulmar for two entire days. That gave them a crucial head start. Their columns, wagons and all, move faster than ours. It is as simple as that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And the Atri-Preda refuses to send out reconnaissance in force,’ Brohl said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wise decision,’ the scout said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How so?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Redmask would turn on such a force. He would overwhelm it and slaughter every soldier in it. Either way, Overseer, we are playing his game.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is… unacceptable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine the Atri-Preda agrees with you, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What can be done?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior’s brows lifted. ‘I do not command this army, Overseer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor do I. ‘If you did?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSudden unease in the scout’s face and he glanced over at the other outrider with them on the ridge, but that man seemed intent on something else, far off on the horizon, as he tore loose bits of dried meat from the thin strip in his left hand, and slowly chewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never mind,’ Brohl said, sighing. An unfair question.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet I would answer still, Overseer, if you like.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Retreat, sir. Back to Drene. Resume claiming land, and protect it well. Redmask, then, will have to come to us, if lie would contest the theft of Awl land.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree. But she will not have it. ‘Sound the recall,’ he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-251.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
