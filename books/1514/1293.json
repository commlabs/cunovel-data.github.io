However, as of now, this vast region had undergone a drastic transformation. In fact, both the ground and sky were completely pitch black.

As of now, the originally peaceful and quiet atmosphere in this mountain range was already ruined. Countless demonic beasts were fleeing the mountain range as quickly as possible.
