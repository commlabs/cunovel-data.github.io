{"id":43373,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\u0026nbsp;Wade Boeman let his eyes wander up the hull of the huge silver ship. He thought; if only Tomer were here now! He caught himself and quickly erased the thought before he remembered more ... things that were better left alone, hidden behind the thin veil he had created in his mind. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The quick blink of a signal light from the tower caught the corner of his eye. H-hour minus fifteen minutes. The ground crews had cleared the area. He hadn\u0027t noticed. He turned to the huge, blond man standing beside him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Allen. This is it. I\u0027ve checked everything myself. You should have no trouble. Be sure and strap yourself in tightly and don\u0027t forget to check the gyro. Its the only thing we can\u0027t double check from the tower.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re all through instructing now, teacher,\" the blond man said. \"I can take it from here. And I can\u0027t say I\u0027m sorry.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade wanted to say then all the little things that had been building up within him during the past long months. He bit back the words. It took much effort.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said: \"Good luck, Captain. I really mean it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Allen gave him a tight smile. \"drop dead, Colonel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade dropped his outstretched hand as the big man ignored him. Ackerson turned his back and began to climb the metal rungs leading up the hull of the ship.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tomer, Wade thought. If only it could be Tomer instead of Ackerson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He waited until the blond man entered the hatch before he climbed into the jeep. He glanced once more at the silver hull of the Starfrost, then he jammed down on the accelerator. Hate was a word Wade seldom used. There was too much of it in the world already. But he was beginning to hate Ackerson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He parked the jeep beside the concrete and steel structure housing Operations. The instant his hand touched the door handle he tried to cease being Wade Boeman the man. He tried to become Colonel Wadon G. Boeman, senior officer in charge of \u0027Operation Boomerang,\u0027 with no personal feelings. It didn\u0027t come off fully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The four walls were lined with banks of instruments. Small lights flickered and died, only to come alive again the next instant. A man coughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He nodded at a communications man, a civilian, as he hurried to the small table where the television set was resting. The closed circuit showed the Starfrost resting alone on the sand with her nose pointed toward the sky.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took off his cap, then lighted a cigarette. He checked his wrist watch with the large clock on the wall. He set the sweep second hand to coincide with the larger one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Twelve minutes, Colonel,\" someone behind Wade said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He wiped his dry lips as he flicked his eyes in the direction of the Major in charge of the control panel. The Major gave him a tight smile. Wade nodded. Major Gormely was a good man ... they were all good men. Wade felt proud to be part of the team.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took in the radar man checking the never-ending sweep of the beam. Frank Piluis, a tall, lanky man of twenty-three. He was checking the screen, adjusting, as if his own life depended on its operation instead of a man he hardly knew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade checked his own screen again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Starfrost was so silent ... so latent ... so important. Wade found Tomer creeping into his thoughts again. He shut the thought out quickly. Wade was a military man. He had orders to forget Tomer. He gave orders. He also had to take them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade became mindful of someone standing behind him. He turned. The man was tall, wearing the cloak of authority in the very way he smiled. Distinguished looking streaks of gray ran over his once brown hair. Tiny wrinkles at the eyes told that he was a man with a sense of humor even though pressed with responsibility.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A penny for your thoughts, Wade.\" The Secretary of Defense said as Boeman got up. Wade wondered if the man had been in the control room all the time. He hadn\u0027t seen him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They aren\u0027t worth it, Harry,\" he answered, offering his hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As bad as that,\" the Secretary laughed. \"Here we are on the edge of a History making moment and you\u0027re wasting your time with worthless thoughts.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Worthless thoughts. Wade wondered if they were, really.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade first met Harry Lowe a long time ago when the project was just a dream on the drawing boards. Since that time he had come to know the Secretary intimately. Now, suddenly, he felt awkward before the man. Perhaps it was because Lowe seemed to have a special talent for reading peoples\u0027 expressions, converting them into sentences. Like now, Wade felt the man was reading his face like a book.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s right, Harry. History is being made isn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Secretary\u0027s face became very serious. \"More than that, Wade. Perhaps salvation depends on it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ten minutes,\" a voice said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade nodded at the technician. Tiny lights came into play on the control panel as Major Gormely began closing circuits. The communications man made a final type check on the huge P.C.R. set.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Starfrost. This is Mother. How do you read me? Over.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mother. This is Starfrost. Loud and clear. Five by five.\" Ackerson\u0027s strong voice came from the loud-speaker located in the center of the equipment. \"Oxygen checks. I\u0027ve bedded down. Give the Colonel my love.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The radio man looked at Wade. There had been no mistaking the sarcasm in Ackerson\u0027s voice. Wade felt his face grow red.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He hasn\u0027t changed,\" he heard the Secretary say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No. He hasn\u0027t changed.\" Wade said softly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t let it throw you, Wade. You\u0027ve done a good job. We both know that nothing counts but the Project.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nothing counts but the project. Personal feelings, ideals, not even human lives. Nothing counts but the project. How many times had he said that to himself, trying to be convincing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s Tomer. Isn\u0027t it?\" the Secretary said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade\u0027s eyes locked with those of the older man. There was no sense going over that now. They had had it out a dozen times already.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That and other things,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Like Ackerson\u0027s attitude, I suppose.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Like Ackerson\u0027s attitude.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Secretary gave a tight smile. \"We all have reasons for doing things, Wade. To you this is a military feat that could spell security for years to come. To me it does that and more. It could be the opening of a new frontier, something that will provide a new outlet for humanity instead of war.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade said: \"And to Ackerson it will mean fame and fortune. Nothing more. His name will go in the history books. There will be personal appearances, contracts, money. He has no feelings at all about what this will mean to his country.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Secretary nodded. \"You\u0027re a professional military man, Wade. You\u0027re making it your life. I understand how you feel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade laughed bitterly, inside. Did Harry know how he felt? Did he think that military men were just brass and polish with no feelings, no friends to worry about, no cares outside of regulations and orders!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Eight minutes.\" The voice came again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wade left the Secretary, went to the mike resting on the communications desk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Starfrost. This is Mother,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3305/90367.html","bookId":421,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:45:17 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:45:17 AM"}
