Big day tomorrow,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. They rose, and she hugged Jaden and Ted, thanking them. “Wow. I appreciate all that you’ve done on this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaden laughed. “Are you kidding? I love this! Can’t wait to just see more and more of what is in that house!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed said the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey parted ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey thought that she might fall asleep as they walked through the darkness toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held Liam’s hand, and leaned against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hit the little spit of land leading out to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a sense of cold and fear sweeping over her as they did so, and she wondered why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she realized that the odd and wretched odor was coming to her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was imagining it. She had it set in her mind. She had to stop, get control of her thoughts and her emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord, that is strong! There has to be a big animal dead on this property somewhere,” Liam said, pausing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You smell it, too?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big-time. The closer we get to the house, the stronger the smell is,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her hand, and they walked faster. He paused, breathing in and grimacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not—it’s not in the house, is it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so, but let’s see what’s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept her hand in his as they walked up the steps to the porch. She opened the door, and they stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in the entry and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s outside,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go out and look,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t know why, but she didn’t want him out in the night. She had to admit to feeling squeamish. She didn’t want to find the dead thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she didn’t want to be left alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said, her fingers tightening around his. “No, please, let’s find out what it is in the morning. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, I can get a flashlight and find out what it is,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you can. I don’t want you to. Please. It’s not in the house. It’s not in the house at all. Please wait until the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him earnestly. He touched her face and smiled after a moment. “All right, we can wait until the morning. It might be a dolphin, I’m afraid. It’s something fairly large, I think. A large mammal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or small and pathetically bloated,” she suggested. “But, whichever, please, let’s let it wait until the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and checked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused again, looking around the house. For once, she didn’t feel uneasy, or as if someone had been there, or as if she were being watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt safe. He was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he told her, “I’ll be right up. I’m just going to take a look around and make sure that everything is locked up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “You won’t be right up. It’s a big house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can move quickly,” he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and headed for the stairs. When she was up in her room, she wondered if she might actually carry a bit of the scent on her, having walked through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast her clothes into the wicker hamper in the bathroom and turned on the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Liam joined her. For a moment he was silent as he slipped in behind her, caught the soap and rubbed it erotically down the length of her back. “I must say, we are extremely clean people,” he whispered against the back of her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and turned into him. “I just…I just wanted to make sure we smelled like soap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say the words; neither did he. While the water cascaded down around them, he cradled her head with his hand and kissed her lips slowly. The steam created a breathtaking mist, and the soap was slick against their bodies. They touched their lengths together, and their hands began to roam, and in the wickedly delicious heat that rose between them she forgot about fear and unease and gave way to the pure decadent pleasure of arousal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey played, stroked and teased in the shower, until at last they turned off the water, groped for towels and headed halfway dry and still steaming into the bedroom. She fell upon him on the clean white sheets, her heart and mind and desire filled with him…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she pulled away, rising quickly and racing to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him groan softly as she turned the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, we’re alone, I checked the house!” he whispered to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t answer. She slid back down him, unable to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it didn’t matter. Her lips were locked with his, his tongue was thrusting into her mouth, hot and fast, and their hands were all over one another, and then their lips, hot wet kisses that covered and seared against flesh, and he was within her, and the world was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made love until sheer exhaustion took over. She slept, curled against him, their limbs entangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she awoke, he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced quickly at the clock, hoping that she hadn’t overslept. Cutter’s funeral was that morning. But, of course, he wouldn’t have let her oversleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just seven-thirty. The funeral wasn’t until ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe groaned, still tired, and dragged herself out of bed, washed her face, brushed her teeth and had one thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have set it to brew by now, she was certain. He was probably downstairs, maybe just about ready to come wake her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey walked downstairs and into the kitchen. She poured herself a cup of coffee, but still didn’t see Liam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked out front, but didn’t see him, and so she came around back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was there. He was standing stiff as a poker, staring into the mangrove brush near the beach. Frowning, she opened the back door and started out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent hit her like a massive wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t seem to stop herself; she started walking toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, get back to the house,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn’t do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she saw what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped her coffee cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe choked back a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it was definitely a large mammal that was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman beings were mammals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam had believed that he could find whatever had died on the property, call animal control and have the poor deceased creature gone long before Kelsey had to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t expected the corpse of a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had lain in the marshy ground by a knot of mangroves, their roots stretching out and into the water, soil accruing by those roots and creating marsh. It appeared that crabs had done quite a bit of damage to the fingers; white bone stuck out from darkened hands. The face was likewise unrecognizable, eaten, darkened, showing bits of cheekbone. The nose appeared to be gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe birds had taken the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s clothing was so darkened by the dark sand, soil and marsh water that they appeared to be just black at first sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no obvious sign of death. The corpse was at an angle, caught in the gnarly arms of the mangrove roots, water washing over it at high tide, receding at low. The corpse was in a severe stage of decomposition, but due to the water, the ground and the creatures that had fed upon it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to tell himself in any way just how long it had been here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week? Five days, seven days?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen had they first noticed the smell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, too, was hard to determine, because the scent of death had lingered about the house itself after Cutter had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, I’ve called for the medical examiner. He’ll be here—soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he said the last word, he heard the sound of the police sirens. The medical examiner would be there in minutes, along with a crime-scene unit to gather whatever clues they might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t sure if there was anything at all a crime-scene unit might gather. He tried to remember how much rain there had been in the last few days. It wasn’t summer, so the rain hadn’t been constant, but they’d had a shower here and there. Footprints? Had the corpse been here during the barbecue? Yes, probably. It had been fresh then, though, hidden by the mangroves, roots and brush; he had found it this morning because he had been looking for a dead animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, please, go back inside. Maybe you could make a really big pot of coffee. I’m sure that it will be greatly appreciated. I think there are still a lot of paper coffee cups left over from the other day.” He was accustomed to crime scenes. He knew that he was speaking calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced at the way she was staring at the corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey!” He snapped her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him at last, her blue eyes wide with empathy and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat. “Oh, God, Liam, who is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Kelsey, I have no idea. I believe that the medical examiner is going to have to give us an ID.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it’s not—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it can be anyone we know well, Kelsey. We saw everyone last night, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, still frozen in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the cars he had called were coming down the drive in front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, coffee? Please. And then go on, get ready. We have Cutter’s funeral today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned at last and went walking stiffly toward the house. He could see a few of the officers from the crime-scene unit moving toward him along with a few of the uniformed officers, armed with their crime-scene tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them came Franklin Valaski, followed by two of his assistants bearing the body bag and stretcher that would shortly be needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my path,” Liam said, pointing to the direct line he had taken from the lawn and the rear of the house through the marsh. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-moon-bone-island-trilogy-3/page-24.html","bookId":2288,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:53:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:53:58 PM"}
