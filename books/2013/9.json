The threat alone should have sufficed to elicit a vigorous hunt, and the notion of an agency of such diabolical purpose-one, he was forced to admit, guided by the most subtle genius-should have enlivened the game until its pursuit acquired the power of obsession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Rautos Hivanar found himself seeking notations among the dusty ledgers for evidence of past floodings, pursuing an altogether more mundane mystery that would interest but a handful of muttering academics. And that, he admitted often to himself, was odd. Nonetheless, the compulsion gathered strength, and at night he would lie beside the recumbent, sweat-sheathed mass that was his wife of thirty-three years and find his thoughts working ceaselessly, struggling against the currents of time’s cyclical flow, seeking to clamber his way back, with all his sensibilities, into past ages. Looking. Looking for something…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Rautos set down the empty cup, then rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked to the door, Venitt Sathad-whose family line had been Indebted to the Hivanars for six generations now-stepped forward to retrieve the fragile Cup, then set off in his master’s wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut onto the waterfront enclosure, across the mosaic portraying the investiture of Skoval Hivanar as Imperial Ceda three centuries past, then down the shallow stone stairs to what, in drier times, was the lower terrace garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the river’s currents had swirled in here, stealing away soil and plants, exposing a most peculiar arrangement of boulders set like a cobbled street, framed in wooden posts arranged in a rectangle, the posts little more than rotted stumps now, rising from the flood’s remnant pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the edge of the upper level, workers, under Rautos’s direction, had used wood bulwarks to keep it from collapsing, and to one side sat a wheelbarrow filled with the multitude of curious objects that had been exposed by the floodwaters. These items had littered the cobbled floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all, Rautos mused, a mystery. There was no record whatsoever of the lower terrace garden’s being anything but what it was, and the notations from the garden’s designer-from shortly after the completion of the estate’s main buildings-indicated the bank at that level was nothing more than ancient flood silts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clay had preserved the wood, at least until recently, so there was no telling how long ago the strange construct had been built. The only indication of its antiquity rested with the objects, all of which were either bronze or copper. Not weapons, as one might find associated with a barrow, and if tools, then they were for activities long forgotten, since not a single worker Rautos had brought to this place was able to fathom the function of these items-they resembled no known tools, not for stone working, nor wood, nor the processing of foodstuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRautos collected one and examined it, for at least the hundredth time. Bronze, clay-cast-the flange was clearly visible-the item was long, roundish, yet bent at almost right angles. Incisions formed a cross-hatched pattern about the elbow. Neither end displayed any means of attachment-not intended, therefore, as part of some larger mechanism. He hefted its considerable weight in his hand. There was something unbalanced about it, despite the centrally placed bend. He set it down and drew out a circular sheet of copper, thinner than the wax layer on a scrier’s tablet. Blackened by contact with the clays, yet only now the edges showing signs of verdigris. Countless holes had been punched through the sheet, in no particular pattern, yet each hole was perfectly uniform, perfectly round, with no lip to indicate from which side it had been punched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Venitt,’ he said, ‘have we a map recording the precise locations of these objects when they were originally found?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, Master, with but a few exceptions. You examined it a week past.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did? Very well. Set it out once more on the table in the library, this afternoon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men turned as the gate watcher appeared from the narrow side passage along the left side of the house. The woman halted ten paces from Rautos and bowed. ‘Master, a message from Invigilator Kards Invictad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very good,’ Rautos replied distractedly. ‘I will attend to it in a moment. Does the messenger await a response?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Master. He is in the courtyard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘See that refreshments are provided.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe watcher bowed then departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Venitt, I believe you must prepare to undertake a journey on my behalf.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Master?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Invigilator at last perceives the magnitude of the threat.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenitt Sathad said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You must travel to Drene City,’ Rautos said, his eyes once more on the mysterious construct dominating the lower terrace. ‘The Consign requires a most specific report of the preparations there. Alas, the Factor’s own missives are proving unsatisfactory. I require confidence in those matters, if I am to apply fullest concentration to the threat closer to hand.’\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-9.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
