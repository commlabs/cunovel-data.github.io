He felt a sense of bitter fatality at the headline blazing at him, and nothing in the story that followed surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headless woman was being called Jane Doe. The coroner estimated that she\u0027d been dead a week to ten days, and she might have been disposed of at almost any point up to a hundred miles upriver. White, approximately five-feet-seven inches, one-hundred-and-thirty pounds, her remains had been badly assailed by the river and the creatures that lived in it. The coroner had nothing else to say for the moment, other than that additional tests were being performed on the victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head had yet to be discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark put down the paper and sipped his coffee, staring at the door to the cottage the three women had taken. Someone had taken in the newspaper, but they had yet to emerge for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was seated at a table behind a pleasant elderly couple from Ohio. There was a pair of honeymooners to his left, Bonnie and Ralph, and a few of the other guests had come by, all cheerful, friendly and wishing him a good morning. Some of them hadn\u0027t read the paper. Some had, and been appalled at what they read. But they all seemed able to distance themselves from the story. A lone young woman, attacked and killed. Yes, it was easy for a pretty girl to be in danger, to become a victim. From the conversations he overheard, most of them also wanted to believe that she had been a drug addict, as well, or a prostitute. Anything to ensure that whatever violence had touched her would never touch them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the same sentiment he heard when the door to cottage number five opened at last and the three young women appeared. An even greater sense of unease surged through him at the sight of Lauren Crow, the woman with the auburn hair and extraordinary green eyes who reminded him so vividly of Katie. The dark haired girlwas stunning as well, exotic and sleek. He decided that she had to be Deanna. The little blonde who looked like a petite princess had to be the one named Heidi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night he had thought of them as bait, but the article in the paper forced him to think in far more brutal terms. They were targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful, all of them, and young. The perfect age. Pure temptation for the killer who had coldly thrown that poor girl\u0027s corpse into the Mississippi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor thing,\" Heidi was saying as the women approached an empty table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horrible,\" Lauren concurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but please, let\u0027s not obsess about it,\" Deanna said. \"I forget the statistics, but just in the United States there are dozens serial killers at work at any given time. But we\u0027d go crazy if we worried about them all on a daily basis. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. It\u0027s just...it\u0027s just a really big headline,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure. The corpse was headless,\" Deanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true. The more gruesome the crime, the bigger the headline,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna linked arms with her, adjusting her sunglasses. \"But we\u0027re smart, and we\u0027re not going to do anything stupid, like going off alone. You were the one who lectured us on safety way back in college-and we listened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad was a cop,\" Lauren reminded her. \"I learned my lessons young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And you taught us. None of us wander around alone at night, and we all keep an eye on who\u0027s around us at all times. We\u0027re all street smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough of this depressing stuff. It\u0027s time to go shopping,\" Heidi said. \"Honestly, Lauren-my dear slave-this is my happy time. I know you always worry about the dangerss of the world, but let\u0027s go shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, shopping,\" Deanna agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching from a distance, homing in on the girls and trying to filter out other conversation, Mark took a long look at Deanna. She looked exhausted, as if she were suffering from a serious lack of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn\u0027t seen him yet. He had his newspaper up in front of his face, his dark glasses in place. They were wandering slowly through the courtyard, as if unsure whether to leave or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coffee?\" Deanna suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get some on the way,\" Heidi said. \"Let\u0027s go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shopping,\" Lauren said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell you\u0027re still worried,\" Heidi said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was that woman last night. The fortune teller,\" Deanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should never have made Lauren do what she didn\u0027t want to,\" Heidi admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over, and I\u0027m all right. Let\u0027s go,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked right past him and didn\u0027t even notice him, Mark noticed with relief. The other two women followed in her wake and didn\u0027t spare him a glance, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the exit from the courtyard, though, Lauren paused and looked back, as if puzzled. As if she thought she should be seeing something but didn\u0027t know what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes fell on him, and she frowned. He stared back at her through the dark lenses of his glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, and he couldn\u0027t tell whether she recognized him from the night before or not. The newspaper was shielding most of his face, and her expression was uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna, concentrating on arranging the strap of her purse, plowed into her. \"Hey! I thought we were leaving,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren didn\u0027t respond. Instead, she walked back into the courtyard, and Mark watched her as she came toward him. \"Hello,\" she said, looking straight at him. His heart lurched. She looked so much like Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We met last night,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bar,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re staying here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a great little place. I see that you and your friends have discovered it, too.\" He rose, extending a hand. \"You told me your name, but I didn\u0027t tell you mine. Mark Davidson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accepted his hand. Touching her, even so casually, sent a jolt through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My last name\u0027s Crow. Lauren Crow,\" she said softly. She turned to her friends, who had followed and were standing behind her. \"These are my friends. Deanna??? and Heidi Weiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" they chimed in unison, stepping up to shake hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two know each other?\" Deanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. We met in the bar last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool,\" Deanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re here from LA. Where do you call home?\" Heidi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the moment?\" he replied. \"I\u0027m in the middle of relocating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you thinking about moving to New Orleans?\" Deanna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a great place,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" Deanna managed around a yawn, then excused herself quickly. \"Not a lot of sleep to be had here, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed that Lauren was just staring at him. Suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do for a living?\" Deanna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren elbowed her friend and gave her a reproving look, but he only laughed out loud. \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m a writer and a musician.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you play?\" Lauren asked sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piano, guitar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you write music?\" Deanna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes. But mostly I confine my writing to article and, some fiction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool,\" Heidi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horror novels?\" Lauren asked pointedly. Those green eyes of hers didn\u0027t leave him for a second. He disturbed her, he thought. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve tried a few different things in my day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you rich and famous?\" Heidi teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m sorry. Just plodding along,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I believe that,\" Deanna said. \"You probably have a pseudonym but you\u0027re not going to share it, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing that deep or mysterious, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, nice to meet you,\" Lauren said. She set a hand on Heidi\u0027s shoulder, her eyes still on him warily. \"We need to get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the hurry?\" Heidi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you wanted to go shopping,\" Lauren reminded her. \"Nice to see you again, Mr. Davidson, but we need to get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was super to meet you,\" Deanna said. Her voice was low and throaty. Sensual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" Heidi agreed. She seemed to croon the single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be seeing you again, I assume. After all, we are staying in the same place,\" Deanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we are,\" Lauren murmured. She didn\u0027t sound happy about the fact, he noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re here for a few days?\" Heidi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. Cottage six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right next door to us,\" Lauren said, unable to hide her surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it?\" he inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we really will see you,\" Lauren said, her suspicion and aggravation evident in her tone. \"But right now, we really do have to get going,\" she said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, walking determinedly toward the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you,\" Deanna said, and winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" Heidi told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Enjoy New Orleans,\" he said, and he sat and pretended to give his full attention to his newspaper once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, you met him last night and you didn\u0027t say anything, much less introduce him?\" Heidi marveled, staring at Lauren as they headed toward Royal Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t exactly meet him,\" Lauren said. \"I bumped into him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only bump into eighty-year-old men with canes,\" Deanna said mournfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s...magnetic,\" Heidi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren shot her a quick glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me like that. I love Barry, and I honestly believe we\u0027re going to beat the odds and be married forever. But if I\u0027d bumped into that guy, I wouldn\u0027t have forgotten it. But you? You didn\u0027t say a word to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren let out a sigh. \"What on earth was I supposed to say? We didn\u0027t have drinks, we didn\u0027t go to dinner. I bumped into him in a hallway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have mentioned it,\" Deanna said. She let out a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s staying at our B and B,\" Heidi commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna stopped walking and laughed. \"Heidi, did you hear that? Lauren, you said that one and filled it with more suspicion than I can believe. What\u0027s the big deal? You bumped into him in New Orleans-and he\u0027s staying in New Orleans. Imagine that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s staying in New Orleans at our B and B,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I call that cool,\" Heidi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re engaged,\" Lauren reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not dead,\" Heidi said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter with you, Lauren?\" Deanna asked. \"You\u0027re not usually like this. The guy is gorgeous and he seemed nice. What\u0027s your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren arched a brow and shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know. I guess I was just nervous last night. And he was standing outside after we first got back last night, I\u0027m certain. I saw him out on the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s staying here we are. He had to be on the street to get here,\" Heidi pointed out, a smile curving her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute,\" Lauren told her. \"Then I found Deanna out by the pool-sleepwalking!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were sleepwalking?\" Heidi asked Deanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess. Luckily, Lauren found me before I drowned. Then again, the water might have woken me up. Who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We probably shouldn\u0027t have taken the red-eye.\" Heidi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today is going to be great,\" Lauren assured her. \"Turn here. That clothing shop you wanted to go to is down a few blocks on the right. I want to go to that gallery across the way. I\u0027ll meet you guys in the place with the great hats in half an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached Heidi\u0027s goal, she shooed them inside and walked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Orleans Police Lieutenant Sean Canady sat at his desk in the precinct, staring at the newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeadless corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was happening again. He groaned aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up to see Bobby Munro standing in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Bobby.\" He didn\u0027t ask his officer if he had seen the headline; he couldn\u0027t have helped but see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mississippi\u0027s a big river. That body could have come from anywhere,\" Bobby said. \"And there have been plenty of perps who behead their victims. Get rid of the head, stall the identification.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby was a damned good officer, Sean thought. Young and good-looking, he was nevertheless a fine cop. He\u0027d seen a hell of a lot already, but he hadn\u0027t become jaded. Bobby saw himself as one of the good guys, and he still believed he could create a better world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean leaned back at his desk, looking up at Bobby. He\u0027d been around a lot longer himself, and while he wasn\u0027t exactly jaded, he was weary. He came from this area. He knew he had the respect of his superiors, from the mayor up to the governor-hell, even up to the Feds. He was given a lot of leeway in his investigations. His word was considered good. So were his instincts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn\u0027t like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An organized killer, trying to hide an ID, would almost certainly have cut off the hands, as well,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve still got fingerprints, and I have a hunch we\u0027ll have an ID on our vic soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drug deal gone bad?\" Bobby suggested hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean shrugged. \"Keep an eye out,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And you remember, Lieutenant. The Mississippi? A big, big river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Sean said, smiling grimly. \"But the corpse is in our morgue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren finished her shopping and arranged for the small piece of art she\u0027d chosen to be delivered to the B and B, then stepped out onto Royal Street. The sun was bright. She shaded her eyes with one hand while she fumbled in her bag for her sunglasses with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the mule-drawn carriages drove by. She blinked, then squinted against the glare. She could have sworn Deanna was in it-on the front seat, right next to the driver, who was tall and dark, and wearing a top hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage kept going at a brisk pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deanna?\" she called, following after it. But there were cars on the street, as well, and she had to move quickly back to the sidewalk and maneuver around all the people there. The carriage was far beyond her before she finally gave up trying to follow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, itt couldn\u0027t have been Deanna, she told herself. Deanna wouldn\u0027t have taken a carriage ride by herself, not when she was supposed to be shopping with Heidi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Lauren made it across the street to one of her favorite clothing shops, she found Heidi in the back alone, trying on hats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Heidi said. \"How\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe straw hat she was trying on was wide-brimmed and sported a bright flower, and Heidi wore it well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Lauren said. \"Where\u0027s Deanna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said something about the shop next door,\" Heidi said. \"She said she\u0027d be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could have sworn I just saw her in a carriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she take a carriage ride without us?\" Heidi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you probably just saw someone who looked like her,\" Heidi said. \"You know, this place is a little pricey, but this really is a nice hat. Should I buy it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Lauren said, still distracted. \"I\u0027m going to check next door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi turned and stared at her. \"You sound worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren, it\u0027s broad daylight. There are a zillion people on the streets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She sighed. \"Let\u0027s look for Deanna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy your hat. I\u0027ll check next door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll meet you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she stepped back onto the street, Lauren was practically assaulted by music. She came to a dead halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something happening in the street. A jazz funeral. The mule-drawn hearse, escorted by mounted police, passed just as she emerged. Behind the hearse came the mourners and, with them, the musicians. It was a spectacle not everyone got to see, something unique, sad yet wonderful, to be found in the city. Someone was about to be laid to rest in grand fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe procession had to be on its way from the church to the cemetery-something of a long route from here, Lauren thought. The musicians were playing a dirge now, but she\u0027d been to several jazz funerals in her life, and she knew that once they left the cemetery there would be a celebration of the deceased\u0027s life. Often the band would play \"When the Saints Go Marching In,\" the old standby. It was an old custom, African beliefs blended with western religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the street, everyone had stopped, watching the procession go slowly by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mourners were black, white and all shades in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the trumpet players was a huge, handsome African-American man. As he played, his eyes lit on Lauren, and she offered him a nod of respect. Strangely, he kept watching her solemnly until he had passed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the funeral had moved on, people began to mill around on the sidewalks again, and cars followed slowly, until they could turn onto a different street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren found herself listening to the sad dirge until the funeral march was but a hint in the air, and the laughter on the street and sounds of a corner rock band overshadowed what had been. Then she gave herself a shake and hurried into the next store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw T-shirts, voodoo potion boxes, alligator heads, votive candles and holders, but no sign of Deanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor did Heidi appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked back into the store where Heidi had been looking at the hat. Neither of her friends was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritated, she took out her cell phone. She tried Deanna\u0027s number first and got her voice mail. The same thing happened when she tried Heidi\u0027s number. Cursing silently, she left her a message, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to go far; they had to be nearby somewhere. But after going in and out of a dozen shops, cafes and restaurants, her level of aggravation peaked, and she gave in to the heat and her own weariness and opted for a table near the street at the last cafe she checked and ordered a giant iced tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she sat, she drew out her sketch pad, but before she could start working on a street scene, she found herself staring at the sketch she had made of the fortune teller the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ruined the whole party, you know,\" she said softly to the sketch. The woman was still striking, everything about her unusual, from the remembered color of her skin to the bone structure of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talking to yourself?\" someone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, startled, wariness slipping through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir handsome neighbor from cottage six was standing by her, a pleasant smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer; she was torn between suspicion and an inexplicable desire to engage in conversation. Okay, maybe not so inexplicable. He was exceedingly attractive. Tall, everything in proportion, muscular without being musclebound, with rugged features that were classically appealing and entirely masculine. She even liked his scent, and felt oddly drawn to move nearer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would actually like to get to know him, she admitted to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then another voice chimed in. The truth was that he scared her. And maybe he scared her just because she felt such a strong sense of attraction to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she have been so afraid if it hadn\u0027t been for what had happened in the Square, the crystal ball and the illusion of genuine danger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" he murmured, and she realized that he was looking at her sketch. \"That\u0027s magnificent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about magnificent,\" she murmured, embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never actually asked if he could join her, and she never suggested that he do so, but he drew out the chair across from her anyway and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was glad, she realized. She liked having him there, liked talking with him. Liked feeling his eyes on her appreciatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet she was still...wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething wasn\u0027t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re quite an artist,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a living,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed her a smile. A very attractive smile. \"Not everyone is good enough to make a living at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your friends artists, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Artists, graphic designers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do logos, fliers, that type of thing?\" he inquired politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and ad layouts and so on,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want him to leave, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was it about him that appealed to her so strongly? She wanted to touch him, make sure he was real, stroke the contours of his face, feel his heart beat under her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the table near the sketch. \"I\u0027ve seen her. It\u0027s an incredible likeness. There\u0027s a touch of magic to her, and you\u0027ve captured it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" She hesitated. \"So you...know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I saw her when I was walking around. She\u0027s so unusual, so arresting, that you feel compelled to look at her. You\u0027ve caught all that in this sketch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you all had your fortunes told?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" His tone was teasing, his smile captivating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, despite his teasing tone, did she sense a note of seriousness behind it? Did he suspect that she had seen a strange vision?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all going to live long, happy lives,\" she lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful So where are your friends now? Did they get lost in New Orleans?\" he asked, a slight frow creasing his brow, though he still spoke lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not lost,\" she said, then added, \"I\u0027ve simply misplaced them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worrying nonetheless,\" he said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s broad daylight, and there are tons of people around,\" she countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waitress came by. \"I\u0027d love a tea, too,\" he said, then looked at Lauren. \"May I buy you lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should really wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until your misplaced friends are located?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her attention to the street momentarily, then looked back at him. She was startled when he set a hand over hers. Pinpricks of sensation seemed to leap like fire across her flesh, pass into her bloodstream and balloon at the center of her being like a flow of lava. She was tempted to pull her hand away, then realized that would be far too indicative of her feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him instead, slowly arching a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly his expression grew serious, and his tone matched it when he spoke. \"Please, you may think I\u0027m insane for saying this, but I promise you, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m afraid that you and your friends are in danger here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there had been more to his earlier question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please,\" she said, closing her eyes for a moment against her disappointment that he\u0027d turned out to be a loon. \"Not this again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll she wanted now was for him to go away. She\u0027d been far too tempted to give in to the appealing fact that he seemed to find her interesting, attractive. To be pursuing her. Because she wanted to be pursued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she didn\u0027t want was this feeling that something was lying beneath every word he said, that he didn\u0027t actually want to be with her and was just plain crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\" he asked sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritation filled her, along with an uncanny sense of fear. \"The fortune teller gave me the same line of bull. We\u0027re here for a bachelorette party, Mr. Davidson. Pure and simple. Heidi is about to get married, and the three of us have been planning this trip for ages. I can\u0027t imagine why you-a stranger-would want to ruin it for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet, leaning back. She could read little from his expression, because his sunglasses suddenly seemed as dark as night. She knew she should just ask him to leave her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still touching her hand, but that wasn\u0027t what was stopping her. It was simply his presence that she couldn\u0027t resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear to you,\" he said very softly, \"I want nothing more than your complete safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not in any danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. You saw this morning\u0027s headline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, a chill snaking through her. \"Does that mean every single woman anywhere near the Mississippi River is in danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a killer working the area,\" he said with such assurance that she felt an ever greater sense of being encompassed of ice, despite the heat of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a cop?\" she asked sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FBI?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So exactly what are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. A writer and a musician.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, that answers that, then. I\u0027m sure you know all about serial killers, not to mention exactly how and why my friends and I are in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was stunned when he replied calmly and in a tone of such level and deep authority that it was the scariest part of it all. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought his tea, and he thanked her, bringing Lauren back to the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to leave now,\" she said. \"And you are going to leave my friends and me alone,\" she told him firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her words when he spoke. \"I know who the killer is. I\u0027ve known about him for a very long time now. He was responsible for the death of my fiancee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren couldn\u0027t believe it of herself, but she didn\u0027t move. She remembered what he had said when she crashed into him the night before. The name he had spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie?\" she said, then hesitated before going on. \"The woman you think I resemble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not your Katie,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rueful smile curled his lips. \"I know that,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you think this man...killed her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She died here, in New Orleans?\" Lauren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t. Katie did see him here, on a trip. And now I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s after you-just as he was after her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was just as attractive and possessed of all the raw sex appeal as she had thought from the beginning-and he was completely crazy. Maybe even a murderer himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could be stalking her, for all she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finally about to get up when he asked, \"Did you all stay in your cottage last night, locked in, once you got home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you out on the street, watching us,\" she accused him, instead of answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you stay in?\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, which is none of your business,\" she lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still seemed concerned. \"I only asked because it\u0027s important,\" he told her quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt oddly uncertain and was angry with herself, but for some reason she couldn\u0027t seem to walk away with things hanging between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Deanna had been outside, sleepwalking, something she\u0027d never done before in her life, and Lauren had been out there with her. Not only that, she\u0027d felt as if someone else had been out there, too, and that somehow this man knew about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the edge of her consciousness was the memory of how she had dreamed about him, and the ridiculous longing somewhere inside that, against all the evidence, he would turn out not to be crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced a casual smile onto her face. \"Okay, I\u0027ll bite. Why is so important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, he reached into his shirt pocket. \"I\u0027d like to give you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, I can\u0027t accept anything from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled then, a charming smile that also managed to convey amusement. \"No strings attached,\" he assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost bowled over by the unconscious sensuality of his appeal. God, how she wished he were normal. She had never met anyone like him, hadn\u0027t even dreamed that she could meet anyone like him, since she had lost Ken. The sound of his voice was alluring, his body language subtly provocative. If she\u0027d met him anywhere else under any other circumstances...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was Katie\u0027s,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at the item he\u0027d produced from his pocket. It was a silver cross, beautifully designed and obviously antique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I definitely can\u0027t take that,\" she told him, staring across the table at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s valuable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never sell it in a thousand years,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I can\u0027t take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her suddenly. \"If you were to take it and wear it, I\u0027d feel better about you being out on the streets of New Orleans. I might even quit being such a pest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you really are crazy,\" she told him frankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. Honestly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up her tea and took a long sip, suddenly aware that she had both elbows on the table now and was leaning closer to him. \"Okay, look at all this from my point of view. First I run into you in a bar. Then I see you standing out on my street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My street, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coincidence, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Then I\u0027m sitting here drinking tea, and suddenly there you are, too, with a crazy tale about trailing a killer. Don\u0027t you think you should go to the police if you know who the killer is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. I\u0027m just not sure yet how to explain what I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s crazy,\" she suggested softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear to you, I only want you to be safe,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe groaned, looking down at her hands. \"I\u0027ve heard a piece of your story, and I\u0027m not at all sure I want to hear the rest. Please...you\u0027re very attractive. But I...I really have to ask you to stay away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. She had managed it; she had said the words and told him to leave her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away, straightening, his expression both resigned and regretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly she heard Heidi\u0027s voice. \"There you are! Lauren, why haven\u0027t you been answering your phone? Oh, hi, Mark. Okay, now I know why you haven\u0027t been answering. Can we join you? Or should we get lost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Heidi wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna was with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi\u0027s voice was, teasing, the day sunny, everything normal.
