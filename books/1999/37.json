That fucking crap feeling I’ve had since this morning starts to turn my thoughts to shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?…Are they?…She’s…oh God, no…no.” Stuart’s voice comes out a whisper. He turns and locks eyes with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know. I just know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re coming now.” I watch the phone slide from Stuart’s ear in slow motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stuart, what’s wrong?” Denny comes from around his drum kit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart casts a glance to Denny, then comes straight back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was Josh.” His lip trembles. “He was just about to leave the hospital, when…” His voice breaks, and he clears his throat, then continues. “Three people were brought into the ER. A car accident. It’s Simone, Dave, and…Tru.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru. Car. Accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. God, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenny clasps his hand over his mouth. “Simone, is she…?” Denny sounds afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m afraid. Terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t breathe. My heart hurts against my ribs. Hurts real bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom and Smith have drawn closer to Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at Denny again. “Josh said Simone is roughed up, but she’ll be okay. Dave too, but…” He brings his eyes back to mine. “Jake…” He steps toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I step back and bump into the guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to hear this. I don’t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. I try to move away again, to get away from Stuart, but there’s nowhere left for me to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry.” I watch, numb, as he wipes a tear from his face. “The other car hit the passenger side. Tru took full impact. Josh said she’s in surgery now. We have to get to the hospital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The baby?” The words fall from my mouth. I don’t feel like it’s me talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I’m sorry. We need to go. Josh is waiting in the ER for us. He’ll take us to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room is closing in on me. There’s no air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I’m underwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrowning. I’m drowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had her this morning, in my arms. I should have kept her there, held her tight, and never let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t lose her. I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, this hurts. So much. Too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake…,” Stuart says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head. “I can’t lose her.” I can’t breathe. I’m gasping for air. “Not her. Anyone but her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes meet his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Another tear falls from his eye. He wipes it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears keep leaving his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to cry. I want to shout. Something. Anything to get this excruciating pain out of my chest. But nothing’s happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, let’s get to the hospital. We’ll know more once we’re there.” Stuart urges me to move, and that’s when my legs give out on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs me, wrapping an arm around my back. “I got you,” his voice cracks. “I got you, Jake. It’s gonna be okay. They’ll both be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine. They’ll both be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m in a car. My car, I think. Stuart’s driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in my chest is unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be doing something. I’m supposed to protect her, protect them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t there. I should have been there,” I choke out. I know it’s me speaking, but it doesn’t sound like my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s gonna be okay, man.” Tom’s hands come over the backseat, pressing down on my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like he’s holding me in place. Like he thinks I’m going to lose control any moment now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to lose control. But I can’t seem to get this maddening, sickening feeling out of my chest. It’s trapped in there, burning every part of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tru’s gonna be fine,” Tom continues. “She’s a fighter. She’ll get through this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what about the baby…my baby?” I choke on the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom’s silence weighs heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re gonna be fine, Jake.” He squeezes my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it is again. That word—fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that isn’t what I want to hear. I don’t want to hear any of this. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be hearing fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to be home with Tru, holding her beautiful body in my arms. I want to feel her skin on mine. Her breath mixing with mine as she kisses me in that gentle way she does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to hear her laugh. I want to see her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to feel my baby kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want…them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m in the hospital. I can hear Stuart talking. There are people everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd white. White walls. White coats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere’s Tru?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn. It’s Josh. He looks sorry. Sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want sympathy. I want Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake…,” he repeats. “I’m so very sorry…” I hear the break in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart puts his hand on Josh’s arm. I see Josh’s eyes go to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks back at me, and then he sounds very businesslike. Like a doctor delivering bad news. “Tru’s in surgery. All they’re telling me right now is that she suffered a severe head injury as a result of the accident. Dr. Kimble, one of the surgeons, will be out to see you soon. If you’ll follow me this way…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSevere. Head. Injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m moving. In an elevator. Upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors open with a ping. Then it’s like I wake up. I realise where I am. Why I’m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru. Car. Accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No. No. No. No. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run out of the elevator, sprinting down the hall. I’m not sure where I’m going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just need to find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurgery. Josh said surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear voices calling out behind me, but I can’t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are you, baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m stopping. Why am I stopping?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms around me, stopping me, holding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want them touching me. I want Tru. I just want Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, take it easy, Jake. You’re here. We need to go in here.” Stuart, with Tom’s help, steers me through a door into a room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFucking white everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I’m sitting in a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to be sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stands with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart. Tom. Smith. Josh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Denny?” Is that me speaking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s downstairs in the ER with Simone and Dave,” Stuart answers. “Why don’t you sit down, Jake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t sit while Tru’s…what? While she’s in surgery? While she’s…dying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she going to die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs my baby dying too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I going to lose them both? Are they both going to die like Jonny did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurts. It hurts so fucking much. I feel like my rib cage is being cracked wide open and my life is being drawn out of me, slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens. A man in a white coat approaches me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want sympathy. I don’t want to be here. I need to get out of here. I need to find Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just want to touch her. Hold her. Never let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Wethers, I’m Dr. Kimble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides start to shake through to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tru…where is she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor puts his hands together in front of him, in an almost prayerlike manner, pointing them in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t like it. I want to knock his fucking hands away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trudy is still in surgery.” He sounds like Josh did—businesslike. “She sustained a very severe head injury…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are those words again. But he said “very.” Josh never said “very.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s worse. Very is worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…excessive bleeding within the skull…pressure on her brain…swelling…baby…delivery…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet the doctor’s eyes. “What?” There’s my voice again, but it still doesn’t sound like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Kimble shifts on his feet. “We had to make a decision, Mr. Wethers. There was no time to waste. The baby was in severe distress. Its heart rate was dropping exponentially. We had no other choice but to perform an emergency caesarean section.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip my hand to my chest, digging my fingers into my sternum, trying to relieve the agonising, burning pain inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she was only twenty-nine weeks…” I can’t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The baby’s fine.” He nods, slowly. “He’s having a little difficulty breathing on his own because of respiratory distress syndrome, which is very common in premature babies, but we’re helping him with that, and he’s responding well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Him?” A tear rolls down my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you have a son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a son, and Tru doesn’t know. She needs to know. I need to see her, to tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll be moving him to the NICU shortly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Tru…will she…is she…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wraps his arms over his chest. “She’s with some of the best surgeons in the world right now, and they’re doing everything they can for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she”—I take a staggered breath—“Is she going to…make it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the look in his eyes, the one he thinks he’s hiding, but I see it clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The doctors are doing everything they can to help her pull through, Mr. Wethers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is the exact moment that my worst fear is realised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could lose Tru, with no way back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLose her. Forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my fist into my forehead. “You don’t think she’s going to make it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifts again, not meeting my eyes. “It’s too early to make an appropriate diagnosis of—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DON’T FOB ME OFF! JUST TELL ME THE FUCKIN’ TRUTH! IS SHE GOING TO DIE?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake…” Tom’s hand touches my shoulder, but I shrug him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest is heaving, fear driving everything inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare into the doctor’s face, searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to know. I have to know if I’m going to lose everything. Lose the only person who has ever mattered to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now, he is the only one who can tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhales, his voice softening. “Right now, Trudy’s chances of survival are fifty-fifty at best. When she wakes from the surgery…” He catches himself, and his expression communicates compassion. “If and when she wakes…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have no idea as to the extent of the damage to her brain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t remember falling. I just know I’m on the floor.
