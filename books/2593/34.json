No one guards the stairs that lead to the basement and as I step down them the music from upstairs changes, melds itself into Belinda Carlisle singing \"I Feel Free.\" The basement has one couple in it who look like Sam and Ilene Sanford but it\u0027s darker down here, warmer, and I could be wrong. I move past them as they stand by the bar drinking champagne and head over toward this extremely well-dressed Mexican-looking guy sitting on a couch. He\u0027s wearing a double-breasted wool jacket and matching trousers by Mario Valentino, a cotton T-shirt by Agnes B. and leather slip-ons (no socks) by Susan Bennis Warren Edwards, and he\u0027s with a good-looking muscular Eurotrash chick - dirty blond, big tits, tan, no makeup, smoking Merit Ultra Lights - who has on a cotton gown with a zebra print by Patrick Kelly and silk and rhinestone high-heeled pumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask the guy if his name is Ricardo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask for a gram, tell him Madison sent me. I pull my wallet out and hand over a fifty and two twenties. He asks the Eurotrash chick for her purse. She hands him a velvet bag by Anne Moore. Ricardo reaches in and hands me a tiny folded envelope. Before I leave, the Eurotrash girl tells me she likes my gazelleskin wallet. I tell her I would like to tit-fuck her and then maybe cut her arms off, but the music, George Michael singing \"Faith,\" is too loud and she can\u0027t hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack upstairs I find Patricia where I left her, alone at the bar, nursing a Perrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Patrick,\" she says, her attitude relenting. \"I just want you to know that I\u0027m - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bitch? Listen, do you want to do some coke?\" I shout, cutting her line off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah... Sure.\" She\u0027s wildly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I yell, taking her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her drink down on the bar and follows me through the deserted club, up the stairs toward the rest rooms. There\u0027s really no reason why we couldn\u0027t do it downstairs but that seems tacky and so we do most of it in one of the men\u0027s room stalls. Back outside the men\u0027s room I sit on a couch and smoke one of her cigarettes while she goes downstairs to get us drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes back apologizing for her behavior earlier this evening. \"I mean I loved Barcadia, the food was outstanding and that mango sorbet, ohmygod I was in heaven. Listen, it\u0027s okay that we didn\u0027t go to Dorsia. We can always go some other night and I know that you probably tried to get us in but it\u0027s just so hot right now. But, oh yeah, I really loved the food at Barcadia. How long has it been open? I think it\u0027s been three, four months. I read a great review in New York or maybe it was Gourmet ... But anyway, do you want to come with me to this band tomorrow night, or maybe we can go to Dorsia and then see Wallace\u0027s band or maybe go to Dorsia after, but maybe it\u0027s not even open that late. Patrick, I\u0027m serious: you should really see them. Avatar is such a great lead singer and I actually thought I was in love with him once - well, actually I was in lust, not love. I really liked Wallace then but he was into this whole investment banking thing and he couldn\u0027t handle the routine and he broke down, it was the acid not the cocaine that did it. I mean I know but so when that all fell apart I knew that it would be, like, best to just hang out and not deal with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJ\u0026amp;B I am thinking. Glass of J\u0026amp;B in my right hand I am thinking. Hand I am thinking. Charivari. Shirt from Charivari. Fusilli I am thinking. Jami Gertz I am thinking. I would like to f**k Jami Gertz I am thinking. Porsche 911. A sharpei I am thinking. I would like to own a sharpei. I am twenty-six years old I am thinking. I will be twenty-seven next year.

I have a lunch appointment at noon - in forty minutes - and beforehand I decide to stop by the cleaners and complain. In addition to the Soprani jacket, the shirts and tie, I bring along a bag of bloodstained sheets that also need cleaning. The Chinese dry cleaners is located twenty blocks up from my apartment on the West Side, almost by Columbia, and since I\u0027ve never actually been there before the distance shocks me (previously my clothes were always picked up after a phone call from my apartment and then were delivered back within twenty-four hours). Because of this excursion I have no time for a morning workout, and since I overslept, owing to a late-night - predawn coke binge with Charles Griffin and Hilton Ashbury that started innocently enough at a magazine party none of us were invited to at M.K. and ended at my automated teller sometime around five, I\u0027ve missed The Patty Winters Show which actually was a repeat of an interview with the President, so it doesn\u0027t really matter, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-34.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
