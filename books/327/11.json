The moon lays its cold light on the windowsill and spreads a luminous coverlet on the bed, leaving the rest of the room in semi-darkness. At the table in the corner under a circle of light shed by the desk lamp sits Rita bent over a thick notebook, her diary. The sharp point of her pencil traces the words:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMay 24\u003c/p\u003e       \n\u003cp\u003eWork kept Rita occupied every day until late at night and she had little time for her diary. After an interval a few more brief entries appeared:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAugust 11\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The gubernia conference is over. Akim, Mikhailo and several others have gone to Kharkov for the all-Ukraine conference, leaving all the paper work to me. Dubava and Pavel have been sent to work at the Gubernia Committee. Ever since Dmitri was made secretary of the Pechorsk District Committee he has stopped coming to lessons. He is up to his neck in work. Pavel tries to do some studying, but we don\u0027t get much done because either I am too busy or else he is sent off on some assignment. With the present tense situation on the railways the Komsomols are constantly being mobilised for work. Zharky came to see me yesterday. He complained about the boys being takenaway from him, says he needs them badly himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAugust 23\u003c/p\u003e   \n\u003cp\u003eAugust 27\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a closed meeting of the bureau. The situation is becoming serious. I cannot write about it\u0026nbsp; in detail just yet. Akim came back from the regional conference looking very worried. Yesterday another supply train was derailed. I don\u0027t think I shall try to keep this diary any more. It is much too haphazard anyway. I am expecting Korchagin. I saw him the other day and he told me he and Zharky are organising a commune of five.\"\u003c/p\u003e     \n\u003cp\u003eTalya Lagutina, the girl from the tobacco factory, led the singing. Her crimson kerchief had slipped to one side of her head and her eyes, whose depths none as yet had fathomed, danced with mischief. Talya had a most infectious laugh and she looked at the world from the radiant height of her eighteen years. Now her arm swept up and the singing poured forth like a fanfare of trumpets:\u003c/p\u003e               \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/16/233.html","bookId":327,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:58:29 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:58:29 AM"}
