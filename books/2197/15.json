I kept starting half awake, and I couldn\u0027t regulate my temperature, which might have had something to do with the blood exchange...or not. I had bad dreams, too, and twice I thought I heard Carla entering the room, only to open my eyes enough to see she wasn\u0027t there. The weird light that entered through the heavily colored glass of the human-only floor was not like real daylight, not at all. It was throwing me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a tad bit better after a long shower, and I lifted the phone to call room service to get something to eat. Then I decided to go down to the little restaurant. I wanted to see other humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few there; not my roommate, but a human playmate or two, and Barry. He gestured to the empty chair at his table, and I dropped into it, looking around for the waiter to signal for coffee. It came right away, and I shuddered with pleasure at the first sip. After I\u0027d finished the first cup, I said - in my way - How are you today? Were you up all night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Stan went to bed early with his new girlfriend, so I wasn\u0027t needed. They\u0027re still in the honeymoon stage. I went to the dance for a while, then I hung out with the makeup girl the Queen of Iowa brought with her. He waggled his eyebrows to tell me that the makeup girl was hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what\u0027s your program for today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you get one of these slid under your door? Barry pushed a stapled sheaf of papers across the table to me just as the waiter brought my English muffin and eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I stuffed it in my purse. Wow, I could talk to Barry while I ate, the neatest answer to talking with your mouth full I could ever devise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Barry cut open a biscuit to slather it with butter, I scanned the pages. An agenda for the night, which was very helpful. Sophie-Anne\u0027s trial had been the most serious case that had to be adjudicated, the only one involving royalty. But there were a couple of others. The first session was set for 8:00, and it was a dispute over a personal injury. A Wisconsin vampire named Jodi (which seemed unlikely in and of itself ) was being sued by an Illinois vampire named Michael. Michael alleged that Jodi had waited until he had dozed off for the day and then broken off one of his canines. With pliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. That sounds...interesting. I raised my eyebrows. How come the sheriffs aren\u0027t handling this? Vampires really didn\u0027t like airing their dirty laundry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interstate,\" Barry said succinctly. The waiter had just brought a whole pot of coffee, so Barry topped off my cup and filled his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped over a page. The next case involved a Kansas City, Missouri, vampire named Cindy Lou Suskin, who\u0027d turned a child. Cindy Lou claimed that the child was dying of a blood disorder anyway, and she\u0027d always wanted a child; so now she had a perpetual vampire preteen. Furthermore, the boy had been turned with his parents\u0027 consent, gotten in writing. Kate Book, the Kansas City, Kansas, lawyer appointed by the state to supervise the child\u0027s welfare, was complaining that now the child refused to see his human parents or to have any interaction with them, which was contrary to the agreement between the parents and Cindy Lou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounded like something on daytime television. Judge Judy, anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, tonight is court cases, I summarized after scanning the remaining sheets. \"I guess we\u0027re needed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I guess so. There\u0027ll be human witnesses for the second case. Stan wants me to be there, and I\u0027m betting your queen will want you there, too. Her subject Bill is one of the appointed judges. Only kings and queens can judge other kings and queens, but for cases involving lesser vampires, the judges are picked from a pool. Bill\u0027s name came out of the hat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, goody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou got a history with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. But I think he\u0027d probably be a good judge. I wasn\u0027t sure why I believed this; after all, Bill had shown he was capable of great deception. But I thought he would try to be fair and dispassionate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had noticed that the \"court\" cases would take up the hours between eight and eleven. After that, midnight to four a.m. was blocked out as \"Commerce.\" Barry and I looked at each other and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swap meet?\" I suggested. \"Flea market?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth night of the conference was the last, and the first half of it was marked \"Free Time for Everyone in Rhodes.\" Some of the suggested activities: seeing the Blue Moon dancers again, or their more explicit division, Black Moon. The difference wasn\u0027t spelled out, but I got the definite idea that the Black Moon employees did much more sexually oriented performances. Different dance teams from the studio were listed as appearing at different venues. The visiting vampires were also advised to visit the zoo, which would be open at night by special arrangement, or the city museum, ditto. Or they could visit a club \"for the particular enjoyment of those who enjoy their pleasures on the darker side.\" It was called Kiss of Pain. Remind me to walk down the other side of the street from that one, I told Barry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou never enjoy a little bite? Barry touched his tongue to his own blunt canines so I couldn\u0027t miss the implication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s lots of pleasure in that, I said, because I could hardly deny it. But I think this place probably goes a little beyond a nip in the neck. Are you busy right now? Because I have to do some legwork for Eric, and I could use some help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Barry said. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to find archery places,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was left for you at the desk, miss,\" said our waiter, who dropped a manila envelope on the table and retreated as if he suspected we had rabies. Evidently our silent exchanges had freaked someone out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the envelope to find a picture of Kyle Perkins inside. There was a note paper-clipped to it in Bill\u0027s familiar cramped handwriting. \"Sookie: Eric says you need this to do some detective work, and that this picture is necessary. Please be cautious. William Compton.\" And just when I was thinking about asking the waiter for a phone book, I saw there was a second sheet. Bill had searched the Internet and made a list of all the archery practice places in the city. There were only four. I tried not to be impressed by Bill\u0027s thoughtfulness and assistance. I\u0027d done with being impressed by Bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called the hotel garage to get one of the cars brought by the Arkansas contingent. The queen had assumed ownership of them, and Eric had offered me one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry had run up to his room to get a jacket, and I was standing by the front door, waiting for the car to be brought around and wondering how much I should tip the valet when I spotted Todd Donati. He came over to me, walking slowly and somehow heavily, though he was a thin man. He looked bad today, the scalp exposed by his receding hairline gray and damp looking, even his mustache sagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood facing me for a moment, not speaking. I thought he was gathering his courage, or his hopelessness. If ever I saw death riding on a man\u0027s shoulder, it was on Todd Donati\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boss is trying to interest your boss in hooking up,\" he said abruptly. If I\u0027d imagined how he\u0027d open our conversation, it had never included that line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, now that she\u0027s a widow, she\u0027s attracting quite a lot of interest,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s an old-fashioned guy in a lot of ways,\" Todd Donati said. \"Comes from an old family, doesn\u0027t like modern thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um-hum,\" I said, trying to sound neutral but encouraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He don\u0027t believe in women making up their own minds, being able to fend for themselves,\" the security chief said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t look like I understood what Donati was talking about, because I sure didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even vampire women,\" he said, and looked at me squarely and directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it,\" Donati said. \"Get your queen to ask him where the security tape is that shows that area in front of her room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" I said, having no idea why I was agreeing. Then the ailing man spun on his heel and walked away with an air of having discharged his duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the car came around, Barry hurried out of the elevator and came over to join me, and any thinking I might have done about the encounter faded in my fear of driving in the city. I don\u0027t think Eric ever considered how hard it would be for me to drive in Rhodes, because he just didn\u0027t think about stuff like that. If I hadn\u0027t had Barry with me, it would have been nearly impossible. I could cope with the driving, or I could look at the map the parking attendant loaned us, but not both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t do too bad, though the traffic was heavy and the weather was cold and raining. I hadn\u0027t been out of the hotel since we\u0027d arrived, and it was kind of refreshing to see the outside world. Also, this was probably the only glimpse of the rest of the city I would get. I did as much looking as I could. Who knew if I\u0027d ever come back? And this was so far north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry plotted our course, and we began our archery tour of Rhodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started with the farthest business, called Straight Arrow. It was a long, narrow place on a very busy avenue. It was gleaming, well-lit - and had qualified instructors behind the counter who were heavily armed. I knew this, because a big sign said so. The men there were not impressed by Barry\u0027s southern accent. They thought it made him sound stupid. Though when I talked, they thought I was cute. Okay, how insulting is that? The subtext, which I read very clearly from their minds, was: women sound stupid anyway, so a southern accent just enhances that adorable dimness. Men are supposed to sound crisp and direct, so southern men sound stupid and weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, aside from their built-in prejudices, these men were not helpful. They\u0027d never seen Kyle Perkins at any of their night classes, and they didn\u0027t think he\u0027d ever rented time to practice at their place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry was fuming at the disrespect he\u0027d endured, and he didn\u0027t even want to go in the second place. I trotted in by myself with the picture, and the one guy at work at the second archery supply store, which had no range, said, \"No,\" immediately. He didn\u0027t discuss the picture, ask me why I wanted to know about Kyle Perkins, or wish me a nice day. He didn\u0027t have a sign to tell me how formidable he was. I figured he just ruded people to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third place, housed in a building that I thought might at one time have been a bowling alley, had a few cars in the parking lot and a heavy opaque door. STOP AND BE IDENTIFIED a sign said. Barry and I could read it from the car. It seemed a little ominous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tired of being in the car anyway,\" he said gallantly, and got out with me. We stood where we could be seen, and I alerted Barry when I spotted the camera above our heads. Barry and I both looked as pleasant as we could. (In Barry\u0027s case, that was pretty pleasant. He just had a way about him.) After a few seconds, we heard a loud click, and the door unlocked. I glanced at Barry, and he pulled open the heavy door while I stepped inside the room and to one side so he could enter, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were faced with a long counter extending the length of the opposite wall. There was a woman about my age behind the counter, with coppery hair and skin, the product of an interesting racial blend. She\u0027d dyed her eyebrows black, which added a touch of the bizarre to the whole uni-color effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked us over just as carefully in person as she had over the camera, and I could read the thought that she was much happier to see Barry than she was to see me. I told Barry, You better take this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I\u0027m getting the idea, he answered, and while I laid Kyle\u0027s picture on the counter, he said, \"Could you tell us if this guy ever came in here to buy arrows or to practice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t even ask why we wanted to know. She bent over to look at the picture, maybe a little farther than necessary to give Barry the benefit of her neckline. She scanned Kyle\u0027s picture and immediately made a face. \"Yeah, he came in here right after dark yesterday,\" she said. \"We\u0027d never had a vampire customer, and I didn\u0027t really want to serve him, but what are you gonna do? He had the money, and the law says we can\u0027t discriminate.\" She was a woman who was ready and willing to discriminate, no doubt about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was anyone with him?\" Barry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, let me think.\" She posed, her head thrown back, for Barry\u0027s benefit. She didn\u0027t think his southern accent sounded stupid. She thought it was adorable and sexy. \"I just can\u0027t remember. Listen, I\u0027ll tell ya what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll get the security tape for last night; we\u0027ve still got it. And I\u0027ll let you have a look at it, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we do that right now?\" I asked, smiling sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I can\u0027t leave the counter right now. There\u0027s no one else here to watch the store if I have to go to the back. But if you\u0027ll come to look tonight after my replacement gets here\" - she cast a very pointed glance at Barry, to make sure I realized I need not come - \"I\u0027ll let you have a peek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time?\" Barry said, rather reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we say seven? I get off right after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry didn\u0027t touch the hint, but he agreed to be back at seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Barry,\" I said as we buckled up again. \"You\u0027re really helping me out.\" I called the hotel and left a message for the queen and Andre, explaining where I was and what I was doing, so they wouldn\u0027t get mad when I wasn\u0027t at their disposal the moment they woke, which should be very soon. After all, I was following Eric\u0027s orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gotta come in with me,\" Barry said. \"I\u0027m not seeing that woman by myself. She\u0027ll eat me alive. That was the War of Northern Aggression, for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ll stay out in the car, and you can yell to me from your head if she climbs on top of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo fill the time, we had a cup of coffee and some cake at a bakery. It was great. My grandmother had always believed that northern women couldn\u0027t cook. It was delightful to find out exactly how untrue that conviction had been. My appetite was also delightful. It was a continuing relief to find that I was just as hungry as I normally was. Nothing vampy about me, no sir!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we filled up the tank and checked our route back to the Pyramid, it was finally time to return to the archery range to talk to Copper. The sky was full dark, and the city glowed with light. I felt sort of urban and glamorous, driving around such a large and famous city. And I\u0027d been given a task and performed it successfully. No country mouse, me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feeling of happiness and superiority didn\u0027t last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first clue that all was not well at the Monteagle Archery Company was the heavy metal door hanging askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" said Barry, which summed up my feelings in a nutshell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got out - very reluctantly - and, with many glances from side to side, we went up to the door to examine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blown or ripped?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry knelt on the gravel to have a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no 007,\" he said, \"but I think this was ripped off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the door doubtfully. But when I bent over to look more closely, I saw the twisted metal of the hinges. Chalk one up for Barry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. Here\u0027s the part where we actually have to go in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry\u0027s jaw tightened. Yeah, he said, but he didn\u0027t sound too sure. Barry was definitely not into violence or confrontations. Barry was into money, and he had the best-paying employer. Right now, he was wondering if any amount of money would be enough to compensate for this, and he was thinking if he weren\u0027t with a woman, he\u0027d just get in the car and drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes male pride can be a good thing. I sure didn\u0027t want to do this by myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved the door, which responded in a spectacular way by falling off its hinges and crashing to the gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, we\u0027re here,\" Barry said weakly. \"Anyone who didn\u0027t know before...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the noise had stopped and nothing had leaped out of the building to eat us, Barry and I straightened up from our instinctive crouching positions. I took a deep breath. This was my task, since this had been my errand. I stepped into the stream of light coming from the empty doorway. I took one big step forward over the threshold of the building. A quick scan hadn\u0027t given me a brain signal, so I pretty much figured what I was going to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah, Copper was dead. She was on top of the counter, laid out in a sprawl of limbs, her head canting off to one side. There was a knife protruding from her chest. Someone had been sick about a yard to the left of my foot - not blood - so there\u0027d been at least one human on-site. I heard Barry step into the building and pause, just as I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d noted two doors from the room on our earlier visit. There was a door to the right, outside the counter, that would admit customers to the range. There was a door behind the counter that would allow employees to duck back for breaks and to attend customers in the range area. I was sure the tape we\u0027d come to watch had been back there, because that would be the natural place for the security equipment. Whether it was still back there, that was the big question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to turn around and leave without a backward glance, and I was scared out of my mind, but she\u0027d died because of that tape, I figured, and it seemed like I\u0027d be discarding her unwilling sacrifice if I discarded the tape. That didn\u0027t really make much sense, but that was how I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not finding anyone else in the area, Barry told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe, either, I said, after I\u0027d performed my second, more thorough, scan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry, of course, knew exactly what I planned to do, and he said, Do you want me to come with you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I want you to wait outside. I\u0027ll call you if I need you. In truth, it would have been nice to have him closer, but it smelled too bad in the room for anyone to stand around for more than a minute, and our minute was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout protesting, Barry went back outside, and I crept down the counter to a clear area. It felt indescribably creepy to scramble over, avoiding Copper\u0027s body. I was glad her sightless eyes were not aimed in my direction as I used a tissue to wipe the area my hands had gripped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the employee side of the counter, there was evidence of a considerable struggle. She\u0027d fought hard. There were smears of blood here and there, and paperwork had gotten knocked to the floor. There was a panic button clearly visible, below the top of the counter, but I guess she hadn\u0027t had time to punch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights were on in the office behind the counter, too, as I could see through the partially open door. I pushed it with my foot, and it swung away from me with a little creak. Again, nothing leaped out at me. I took a deep breath and stepped through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was a combination security room/office/break-room. There were counters built around the walls with rolling chairs pulled up to them, and there were computers and a microwave and a little refrigerator: the usual stuff. And there were the security tapes, heaped in a pile on the floor and smoldering. All the other smells in the outer room had been so bad we simply hadn\u0027t gotten around to this one. There was another door leading out; I didn\u0027t go check to see where it led to, because there was a body blocking it. It was a man\u0027s body, and it was lying facedown, which was a blessing. I didn\u0027t need to go over to check to see if he was dead. He was surely dead. Copper\u0027s replacement, I assumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, crap,\" I said out loud. And then I thought, Thank God I can get the hell out of here. One thing about the security tapes having been burned: any record of our earlier visit was gone, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way, I pressed the panic button with my elbow. I hoped it was ringing somewhere at a police station, and that they\u0027d get here soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry was waiting for me outside, as I\u0027d been 99 percent sure he would be. Though I confess I wouldn\u0027t have been completely surprised if he\u0027d left. \"Let\u0027s book! I set off the alarm,\" I said, and we jumped into the car and got the hell out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was driving, because Barry was looking green. We had to pull over once (and in Rhodes traffic that wasn\u0027t easy) for him to be sick. I didn\u0027t blame him one little bit. What we\u0027d seen was awful. But I\u0027ve been blessed with a strong stomach, and I\u0027d seen worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got back to the hotel in time for the judicial session. Barry looked at me with gaping astonishment when I commented that I\u0027d better get ready for it. He hadn\u0027t had an inkling what I\u0027d been thinking, so I knew he was really feeling bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you think of going?\" he said. \"We have to tell someone what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called the police, or at least a security company who\u0027ll report it,\" I said. \"What else can we do?\" We were in the elevator rising from the parking garage to the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to talk to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" The doors opened and we stepped out into the hotel lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That someone tried to kill you last night here by...okay, throwing an arrow at you.\" He fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. See?\" I was getting his thoughts now, and he\u0027d come to the correct conclusion. \"Would it help solve her murder? Probably not, because the guy is dead and the tapes are destroyed. And they\u0027d come here asking questions of the master vampires of a third of the United States. Who would thank me for that? No one, that\u0027s who.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t stand by and do nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t perfect. I know that. But it\u0027s realistic. And practical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so now you\u0027re practical?\" Barry was getting shrieky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re yelling at my - at Sookie,\" said Eric, earning another shriek (this one wordless) from Barry. By that time, Barry didn\u0027t care if he ever saw me again in his life. Though I didn\u0027t feel quite that drastic, I didn\u0027t think we were going to become pen pals, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Eric didn\u0027t know how to pick a term for what I was to him, I was equally stumped. \"Do you need something?\" I asked him in a voice that warned him I wasn\u0027t in the mood for any double entendres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you find out today?\" he asked, all business, and the starch ran out of me in a stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go on,\" I told Barry, who didn\u0027t need telling twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked around for a safe place to talk, didn\u0027t see one. The lobby was busy with vampires who were going to the judicial proceedings, or chatting, or flirting. \"Come,\" he said, not as rudely as it sounds, and we went to the elevators and up to his room. Eric was on the ninth floor, which covered a much larger area than the queen\u0027s. There were twenty rooms on nine, at least. There was a lot more traffic, too; we passed quite a few vamps on the way to Eric\u0027s room, which he told me he was sharing with Pam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a little curious about seeing a regular vampire room, since I\u0027d seen only the living room of the queen\u0027s suite. I was disappointed to find that aside from the traveling coffins, it looked quite ordinary. Of course, that was kind of a big \"aside.\" Pam\u0027s and Eric\u0027s coffins were resting on fancy trestles covered with fake hieroglyphics in gilt on black-painted wood, which gave them a neat atmospheric touch. There were two double beds, too, and a very compact bathroom. Both towels were hung up, which I could see because the door was open. Eric had never hung up his towels when he lived with me, so I was willing to bet that Pam had folded them and hung them on the rack. It seemed oddly domestic. Pam had probably picked up for Eric for over a century. Good God. I hadn\u0027t even managed two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat with the coffins and the beds, the room was a bit crowded, and I wondered what the lower echelon vamps had to put up with, say, on floor twelve. Could you arrange coffins in a bunk configuration? But I was just waffling, trying not to think about being alone with Eric. We sat down, Eric on one bed and I on another, and he leaned forward. \"Tell me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s not good,\" I said, just to put him on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face darkened, the blond brows drawing in to meet, his mouth turning down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did find an archery range that Kyle Perkins visited. You were right about that. Barry went with me to be nice, and I really appreciated it,\" I said, getting my opening credits in. \"To condense the whole afternoon, we found the right range at our third stop, and the gal behind the counter said we could look at the security tape from the night Kyle visited. I thought we might see someone we knew coming in with him. But she wanted us to come back at the end of her shift, seven o\u0027clock.\" I paused to take a deep breath. Eric\u0027s face didn\u0027t change at all. \"We came back at the appointed time, and she was dead, murdered, in the store. I went past her to look in the office, and the tapes had been burned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Killed how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d been stabbed, and the knife was left in her chest, and the killer or someone with him had thrown up food. Also, a guy who worked at the store was killed, but I didn\u0027t check him out to see how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" Eric considered this. \"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, and got to my feet to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barry was angry with you,\" he observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he was, but he\u0027ll get over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t think I handled the...He doesn\u0027t think we should\u0027ve left. Or...I don\u0027t know. He thinks I was unfeeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you did exceptionally well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, great!\" Then I clamped down on myself. \"Sorry,\" I said. \"I know you meant to compliment me. I\u0027m not feeling all that good about her dying. Or leaving her. Even if it was the practical thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re second-guessing yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock at the door. Since Eric didn\u0027t shift himself, I got up to answer it. I didn\u0027t think it was a sexist thing; it was a status thing. I was definitely the lower dog in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely and totally not to my surprise, the knocker was Bill. That just made my day complete. I stood aside to let him enter. Darn if I was going to ask Eric if I should let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill looked me up and down, I guess to check that my clothes were in order, then strode by me without a word. I rolled my eyes at his back. Then I had a brilliant idea: instead of turning back into the room for further discussion, I stepped out of the open door and shut it behind me. I marched off quite briskly and grabbed the elevator with hardly any wait. In two minutes, I was unlocking my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnd of problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt quite proud of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarla was in our room, naked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I said. \"Please put on a robe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hey, if it bothers you,\" she said in a fairly relaxed manner, and pulled on a robe. Wow. End of another problem. Direct action, straightforward statements; obviously, those were the keys to improving my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said. \"Not going to the judicial stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human dates aren\u0027t invited,\" she said. \"It\u0027s Free Time for us. Gervaise and I are going out nightclubbing later. Some really extreme place called Kiss of Pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be careful,\" I said. \"Bad things can happen if there are lots of vamps together and a bleeding human or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle Gervaise,\" Carla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s nuts about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until he stops being nuts. Or until a vamp older than Gervaise takes a shine to you, and Gervaise gets all conflicted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked uncertain for a second, an expression I felt sure Carla didn\u0027t wear too often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you? I hear you\u0027re tied to Eric now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only for a while,\" I said, and I meant it. \"It\u0027ll wear off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will never go anywhere with vampires again, I promised myself. I let the lure of the money and the excitement of the travel pull me in. But I won\u0027t do that again. As God is my witness... Then I had to laugh out loud. Scarlett O\u0027Hara, I wasn\u0027t. \"I\u0027ll never be hungry again,\" I told Carla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, did you eat a big supper?\" she asked, focused on the mirror because she was plucking her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. And I couldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up with you?\" Carla swung around to eye me with some concern. \"You\u0027re not acting like yourself, Sookie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just had a bad shock,\" I said, gasping for breath. \"I\u0027ll be okay in a minute.\" It was more like ten before I gathered my control back around me. I was due at the judicial meeting, and frankly, I wanted to have something to occupy my mind. I scrubbed my face and put on some makeup, changed into a bronze silk blouse and tobacco-colored pants with a matching cardigan, and put on some brown leather pumps. With my room key in my pocket and a relieved good-bye from Carla, I was off to find the judicial sessions. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-together-dead-sookie-stackhouse-7/page-15.html","bookId":2197,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:20 PM"}
