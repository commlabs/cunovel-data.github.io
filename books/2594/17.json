I bought new golden lamps, and censers. I bought fine carpets from the markets in Venice, and golden silks from China as well. From the seamstresses of Florence I commissioned new garments for my Immortal Parents, and then carefully dressed them, relieving them of rags which should have been burnt long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while I spoke to them in a consoling voice of the miracles I had seen in the changing world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid before them fine printed books as I explained the ingenious invention of the printing press. And I hung over the doors to the shrine a new Flemish tapestry, also bought in Florence which I described to them in detail, so they might choose to look with their seemingly blind eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I went to the city of Florence and gathering up all the pigment and oil and other materials which my servant had procured for me, I brought it to the mountain shrine, and I proceeded to paint the walls in the new style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not seek now to imitate Botticelli. But I did return to the old motif of the garden which I had so loved centuries ago, and I soon found myself rendering my Venus, my Graces, my Flora, and infusing into the work all the details of life which only a blood drinker can behold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Botticelli had painted the dark grass rich with varied flowers,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI revealed the small insectile creatures inevitably concealed there, and then the most flamboyant and beautiful of creatures, the butterflies and the varicolored moths. Indeed my style ran to frightening detail in every respect, and soon an intoxicating and magic forest surrounded the Mother and Father, the egg tempera lending a gleam to the whole which I had never achieved in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I studied it, I became ever so slightly dizzy, thinking of Botticelli\u0027s garden, indeed, thinking even of the garden I had dreamt of in old Rome, of the garden I had painted\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;and soon I had to shake myself and collect myself because I did not know where I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Royal Parents seemed more solid and remote than ever. All trace of the Great Burning was now gone from them in that their skin was purely white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been so long since they had moved that I began to wonder if I had dreamt those things which had happened\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;if I had imagined the sacrifice of Eudoxia\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;but now my mind was very much intent upon escaping the shrine for long periods of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last gift to the Divine Parents\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;after all my painting was done, and Akasha and Enkil were decked out with all new jewels\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;was a long bank of one hundred beeswax candles which I lighted for them all at once with the power of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I saw no change in the eyes of the King and Queen. Nevertheless, it gave me great pleasure to offer this to them; and I spent my last hours with them, letting the candles burn down as I told them in a soft voice of all the wonders of the cities of Florence and Venice which I had come to love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI vowed that every time I came to them I would light the one hundred candles. It would be a small proof of my undying love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat caused me to do such a thing? I have no true idea. But after that I kept a great supply of candles always in the shrine; I stored them behind the two figures; and after the offering, I would replenish the bronze holder and take away all melted wax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen all this had been done, I returned to Florence and to Venice, and to the rich high-walled little city of Siena, to study paintings of all sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, I wandered through palaces and churches throughout Italy, quite drunken on what I beheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I have described, a great fusion had taken place between Christian themes and ancient pagan style, which was developing everywhere. And though I still perceived Botticelli to be the Master, I was taken aback by the plasticity and wonder of much of what I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices in the taverns and in the wine shops told me I ought to go North to see paintings as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow this was news to me, for North had always meant the land of the less civilized, but so great was my hunger for the new styles that I did as I was told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found throughout all of northern Europe an intense and complex civilization which I had surely underestimated, most particularly I think in France. There were great cities in existence and Royal Courts which supported painting. There was much for me to study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did not love the art which I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI respected the works of Jan van Eyck, and Rogier van der Weyden, of Hugo van der Goes, and of Hieronymus Bosch and many other nameless masters whom I beheld, but their work did not delight me as did the work of the Italian painters. The Northern world was not as lyrical. It was not as sweet. It still bore the grotesque stamp of the work of purely religious art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I soon returned to the cities of Italy where I was richly rewarded for my wanderings with no end in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI soon learnt that Botticelli had studied with a great master, Filippo Lippi, and that this one\u0027s son, Filippino Lippi, was working with Botticelli right now. Other painters whom I loved included Gozzoli and Signorelli, and Piero della Francesca and beyond that so many that I do not want to mention their names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all during my study of painting, my little travels, my long nights of adoring attention to this or that wall, or this or that altarpiece, I did not let myself dream of bringing Botticelli to me, and I never lingered long near any place where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that he prospered. I knew that he painted. And that was quite enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut an idea had come to brew in me\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;an idea as strong as the earlier dream of seducing Botticelli had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I were to reenter the world again, and to live in it as a painter? Oh, not a working painter who took commissions, that would be nonsense, but an eccentric gentleman who chose to paint for his own pleasure, admitting mortals to his house to dine at his table and drink his wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I not done so in a bumbling way in the ancient nights before the first sack of Rome? Yes, I had painted my own walls with crude, hasty images, and I had let my good-natured guests laugh at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes, a thousand years had passed since then, more in fact, and I could no longer easily pass for human. I was too pale and too dangerously strong. But was I not more clever now, more wise, more practiced with the Mind Gift, and more willing to mask my skin with whatever emollients were required to dim its preternatural gleam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was desperate to do it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it would not be in Florence. That was far too close to Botticelli. I would attract his notice and were he to set foot under my roof, I would be driven to extremes of pain. I was in love with the man. I could not deny it. But I had another, most marvelous choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the gorgeous and glittering city of Venice which drew me with its indescribably majestic palaces, their windows open to the constant breezes of the Adriatic, and its dark winding canals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed I should make a new and spectacular beginning there, purchasing for myself the finest house available, and acquiring a bevy of apprentices to prepare my paints for me, and the walls of my own house which would eventually receive my best efforts after I had done some panels and canvases to once again learn my craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for my identity I would be Marius de Romanus, a man of mystery and incalculable wealth. Simply put, I would bribe those I had to bribe to obtain the right to remain in Venice, and thereafter spend freely among those who came to know me in the smallest capacity, and give generously to my apprentices who would be recipients of the finest education I could obtain for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstand please that in this time the cities of Florence and Venice were not part of one country. Far from it. Each was a country unto itself. And so being in Venice I was quite removed from Botticelli, and would be subject to very important laws which the citizens of Venice were required to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow as to the matter of my appearance I intended to be careful in the extreme. Imagine the effect upon a mortal heart were I to reveal myself in all my coldness, a blood drinker of some fifteen hundred years in age with purely white skin and flashing blue eyes. So the matter of emollients was no small thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenting rooms in the city, I purchased from the perfume shops the very finest tinted salves I could find. Then to my skin I applied these ointments, carefully inspecting the results in the finest mirrors which could be had. I soon made a blending of salves which was most perfect for not only darkening my cold complexion, but for bringing back to visibility in it the finest little wrinkles or lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI myself had not known that these lines of human expression still remained to me, and I was most happy to discover them, and I rather liked the image that I presented to the glass. As for the perfume, it was pleasing, and I realized that once settled in my own house, I could have the proper salves made for me and have them always on hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took some months to complete my entire plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this was largely because I had fallen in love with one particular palazzo, a house of great beauty, its facade covered in glistering marble tiles, its arches in the Moorish style, and its immense rooms more luxurious than anything I had ever beheld in all my nights, and even my long ago days. The lofty ceilings amazed me. We had known nothing like them in old Rome, at least not in a private house. And on top of the immense roof was a carefully arranged roof garden from which one could view the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the ink was dry upon the parchment, I set out to purchase for myself the finest furnishings imaginable\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;coffered beds, desks, chairs, tables, all the usual appointments including gold-threaded draperies for every window\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;and I set to the task of managing all this a clever and genial old man named Vincenzo, a creature of extremely solid health, whom I had bought almost as if he were a slave from a family who had no more use for him and kept him about in shameful neglect because he had once educated their sons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw in Vincenzo just the sort of governor I would need for all the apprentices I meant to buy from their Masters, boys who would bring some skill already learnt to the tasks they had to do for me. I was also pleased with the fact that the man was already old which meant I did not have to be tormented by the spectacle of youth dying in him. Rather I could pride myself, perhaps foolishly, on visiting upon him a rather splendid old age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I find the creature? I went about reading minds to discover what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was now more powerful than ever, I could find the Evil Doer effortlessly. I could hear the secret thoughts of those who sought to cheat me or those who loved the mere sight of me. And the latter was a dangerous thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy dangerous, you might ask? The answer is that I was now more than ever susceptible to love, and when seen with loving eyes I knew it and I slowed my pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a strange mood would descend upon me while walking in the arcade along San Marco if someone should be looking at me admiringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would turn about, taking my time, and double back perhaps, and only reluctantly move away, rather like a bird in some northern clime enjoying the warmth of the sun on its wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeantime, with gold in his hands, Vincenzo was sent to buy fine clothes for himself. I would make a gentleman of him, in so far as the sumptuary laws allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd seated at my new desk in a spacious bedchamber floored in marble with windows open to the winds off the canal, I wrote out lists of those additional luxuries which I desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted a lavish old Roman-style bath built for me in this bedchamber, so that I could enjoy the warm water whenever I wished. I wanted shelves for my books, and a finer chair for this desk. Of course there should be another library. What was a house to me if it did not possess a library? I wanted the finest clothing, the fashionable hats and leather shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew pictures to guide those who would carry out my designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were heady times. I was a part of life once more and my heart was beating to a human pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHailing a gondola at the quais, I traveled the canals for hours looking up at the spectacular facades which made up the waterways of Venice. I listened to the voices everywhere. I lay back sometimes on my elbow and gazed up at the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt various goldsmith shops and painters\u0027 workshops I chose my first gathering of apprentices, taking every opportunity to select the brilliant ones who were for various reasons among the wronged, and neglected, and abused. They would show me profound loyalty and untapped knowledge, and I sent them off to their new home with gold coins in their hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I procured clever assistants because those were necessary, but I knew I would be very successful with the poorlings. Force was riot required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeantime, it was my wish that my boys should be educated for the university\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;not a customary thing with a painter\u0027s apprentice\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;so I chose tutors for them and arranged for these men to come to my house in the daylight hours to perform instruction as required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys would learn Latin, Greek, philosophy, the newfound and much valued \"classics,\" some mathematics and whatever they needed to proceed in life. If they excelled in painting and they chose it, they could of course forget the university and follow the painter\u0027s path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I had a houseful of healthy and noisy activity. There were cooks in the kitchen, and musicians teaching my boys to sing and play the lute. There were dancing instructors and there were fencing matches over the marble floors of the great salons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did not open my doors to the populace as I had done in long ago Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too wary to do such a thing in Venice, too unsure of my ruse, too uncertain of what questions my mad painting might arouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I need only have my young male assistants, I fancied, both to keep me company and to help me, for there was much to be done preparing the walls for my frescoes and covering my panels and canvases with the proper varnishes for my work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, there was not much for anyone to do for some weeks, for during that period I wandered the local workshops and studied the painters of Venice as I had studied the painters of Florence not long before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt in my mind, after this studious examination, that I could mimic mortal work to some extent, but I could not hope to surpass it. And I feared what I would accomplish. And I resolved to keep my house closed to all but the boys and their instructors as arranged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking to my bedroom study, I began a journal of my thoughts, the first I had ever kept since the nights in old Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote of the comforts I enjoyed. And I chastised myself with more clarity than I did in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have become a fool for the love of mortals,\" I wrote, far more than you ever did in the ancient nights. For you know you have chosen these boys so that you might instruct them and mold them, and there will be loving in it and hope in it, and the intention of sending them on to be educated at Padua, as though they were your mortal children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if they should come to discover that you are a beast in heart and soul, and they run from your touch, what then? Will you slaughter them in their innocence? This is not ancient Rome with its nameless millions. This is the strict Republic of Venice where you play your games, and for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the color of the evening sky over the piazza that you see when you are first risen, for the domes of the church beneath the moon? For the color of the canals that only you can behold in the starlight? You are a wicked and greedy creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill art satisfy you? You hunt elsewhere, in the surrounding towns and hamlets, or even in distant cities, for you can move with the speed of a god. But you bring evil to Venice because you are evil, and in your fine palazzo, lies are told, lies are lived, lies may fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put down the quill. I read over my words, forever memorizing them, as if they were a foreign voice speaking to me, and only when I\u0027d finished did I look up to see Vincenzo, so polite and humble, and so dignified in his new clothes, waiting to speak to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I asked gently so as not to make him think I disapproved of him for coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, only let me tell you . . .\" he said. He looked quite elegant in his new velvet, rather like a prince at court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, do tell me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only that the boys are so happy. They are all in bed now and sleeping. But do you know what it means to them that they have plenty to eat and decent clothes, and are learning their lessons with a purpose? I could tell you many stories, too many I think. There\u0027s not a dullard among them. It\u0027s such luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very good, Vincenzo,\" I said. \"Go have your supper. Enjoy as, much wine as you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the stillness after he had left me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed quite impossible that I had made this residence for myself, and that nothing had stopped me. I had hours before dawn during which I might rest on my bed, or read among my new books before making the short journey to another place within the city where a sarcophagus had been hidden in a gold-lined chamber in which I would sleep by day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I chose instead to go to the great room which I had designated as my studio, and there I found the pigments and other materials ready for me, including several wooden panels which my young apprentices had prepared as directed for me to paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a small matter to blend the tempera and I did it quickly so that I had a wealth of colors at my command, and then glancing over and over again into a mirror which I had brought into the room with me, I painted my own portrait in quick exact strokes with little or no correction until it was complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I was finished, I stood back from my creation, and I found myself staring into my own eyes. It wasn\u0027t the man of long ago who had died in the northern forest, or the frantic blood drinker who had taken the Mother and the Father out of Egypt. Nor was it the starved and dogged wanderer who had slipped soundlessly through time for so many hundreds of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bold and proud immortal who looked at me, a blood drinker who demanded that the world at last give him some quarter, an aberrant being of immense power who insisted that he might have a place among the human beings of which he had in former times been one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the months passed, I discovered that my plan was working quite well. In fact it was working marvelously!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI became obsessed with my new clothing of the period, velvet tunics and stockings, and marvelous cloaks trimmed in rare fur. Indeed mirrors were an obsession with me now as well. I could not stop looking at my own reflection. I applied the salves with great care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach evening, after sunset, I arose fully dressed with the requisite disguise on my skin, and I arrived at my palazzo to a warm greeting from all my children, and then dismissing the many teachers and tutors, I presided over a good banquet with my children where all were delighted to have the rich food of princes, as music played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in a mild manner I questioned all my apprentices as to what they had learnt that day. Our conversations were long, complex, and full of wonderful revelations. I could easily surmise which teacher had been successful, and which had not wrought the effects I desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the boys themselves, I soon saw which of the boys possessed the greater talent, who should be sent off to the University of Padua, and who should be schooled as a goldsmith or a painter. Of failures we had none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou understand, this was a transcendent enterprise. To repeat, I had chosen all of these boys by means of the Mind Gift, and what I offered them in these months, which soon stretched to years, was something they would never have had if I had riot intervened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had become a magician for them, aiding them to realize accomplishments of which they hadn\u0027t ever} dreamt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was no doubt that I found immense satisfaction in this achievement, for I was a teacher of these creatures, just as I had long ago wanted to be the teacher of Avicus and Zenobia, and during all this time I thought of Avicus and Zenobia. I could not help but think of them and wonder what had become of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad they survived?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew this about myself: I had loved both Zenobia and Avicus because they allowed me to be their teacher. And I had fought with Pandora because she would not. She was far too finely educated and clever to be anything but a fierce verbal and philosophical opponent and I had left her, stupidly, on that account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no amount of such self-knowledge caused me to not long for my lost Zenobia and for Avicus, and to wonder what paths they\u0027d taken through the world. Zenobia\u0027s beauty had struck a deeper note in me than the beauty of Avicus, and I could not relinquish the simple recollection of the softness of Zenobia\u0027s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, when I was alone in my bedroom in Venice, when I sat at my desk watching the curtains blow out from the windows, I thought of Zenobia\u0027s hair. I thought of it lying on the mosaic floor in Constantinople, after she had cut all of it so that she might travel the streets as a boy. I wanted to reach back over a thousand years and gather it up in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS for my own blond hair, I could wear it long now for this was the style of the period, and I rather enjoyed it, brushing it clean without resentment, and going out to walk in the piazza while the sky was still purple knowing people were looking at me, wondering just what sort of man I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for my painting, I went about it using a few wooden panels with only a handful of apprentices in my studio, locked off from the world. I created several successful religious pictures\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;all of the Virgin Mary and the Angel Gabriel appearing to her, because this theme\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;The Annunciation\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;appealed to me. And I was rather amazed at how well I could imitate the style of the times:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I set upon a major undertaking which would be a true test of my immortal skill and wits. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-17.html","bookId":2594,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM"}
