He had the soul jade slip in one hand, and the Purple Comet Spear in the other. He stood upright atop the Vermillion Bird, his long hair scattered in the wind, his murderous intent wantonly overflowing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnderneath Lin Ming, Fireshine seemed to sense his killing intent.

He stood on Fireshine’s back, closing out all six senses of his body and entering the ethereal martial intent state. Now, there was only his perception left behind.

Once a jade slip cracked even a bit, that proved that Qin Xingxuan’s life had received a massive amount of damage, a point of no return. At most, she would only be able to survive for 10 more days!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t even speak a single word, remaining silent. Because of Lin Ming’s silence, the surrounding atmosphere became oppressive like they were in a pool of viscous blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis invisible pressure even frightened Qin Ziya, causing him to feel a tinge of fear.

The two of them had a very good friendship. Qin Yao was older than her by four years. Her talent was mediocre, but she still wanted to try and reach the Xiantian realm.

And under the suppression of the giant force known as the Seven Profound Martial House, even her master Mister Muyi was unable to do anything, along with her grandfather. Now, all that she could do was wait for the newly crowned emperor to fabricate a false charge against her Qin Family, and the heads of all her family members would roll onto the ground!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe didn’t want to yield.
