Ben - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s any use talking to him.

Maybe Gottstein can have some effect on him, but I doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison shrugged, a useless maneuver inside his space-suit. \"I don\u0027t understand him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" said Selene, softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison did not respond directly. He shoved the Pionizer and its attendant apparatus into its rocky shelter and said, \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slipped into the surface entrance at Outlet P-4 in silence and Denison climbed down the entry ladder. Selene dropped past him, braking in quick holds at individual rungs. Denison had learned to do that, but he was dispirited and climbed down in a kind of rebellious refusal to accept acclimation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey removed their suits in the staging areas, placed them in their lockers. Denison said, \"Would you join me for lunch, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said uneasily, \"You seem upset. Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reaction, I think. Lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate in Selene\u0027s quarters. She insisted, saying, \"I want to talk to you and I can\u0027t do it properly in. the cafeteria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Denison was chewing slowly at something that had a faint resemblance to peanut-flavored veal, she said, \"Ben, you haven\u0027t said a word, and you\u0027ve been like this for a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t,\" said Denison, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you have.\" She looked into his eyes with concern. \"I\u0027m not sure how good my intuition is outside physics, but I suppose there\u0027s something you don\u0027t want to tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison shrugged. \"They\u0027re making a fuss about all this back on Earth. Gottstein has been pulling at strings as tough as cables in advance of his trip back. Dr. Lamont is being lionized, and they want me to come back once the paper is written.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It seems I\u0027m a hero, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Complete rehabilitation,\" said Denison, thoughtfully, \"is what they offer. It\u0027s clear I can get a position in any suitable university or government agency on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that what you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I imagine Lamont wants, and would enjoy, and will certainly get. But I don\u0027t want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, \"What do you want then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to stay on the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s the cutting edge of humanity and I want to be part of that cutting edge. I want to work at the establishment of cosmeg pumps and that will be only here on the Moon. I want to work on para-theory with the kind of instruments you can dream up and handle, Selene. . . . I want to be with you, Selene. But will you stay with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am as interested in para-theory as you are.\" Denison said, \"But won\u0027t Neville pull you off the job now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barren pull me off?\" She said, tightly, \"Are you trying to insult me, Ben?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, do I misunderstand you? Are you suggesting that I\u0027m working with you because Barron ordered me to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he did. But that\u0027s not why I\u0027m here. I choose to be here. He may think he can order me about but he can only do so when his orders coincide with my will, as in your case they did. I resent his thinking he can order me otherwise, and I resent your thinking it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two are sex-partners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have been, yes, but what has that to do with it? By that argument, I can order him about as easily as he me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you can work with me, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly,\" she said, coldly. \"If I choose to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But do you choose to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As of now, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Denison smiled. \"The chance that you might not choose to, or even might not be able to, is, I think, what has really been worrying me this past week. I dreaded the end of the project if it meant the end of you. I\u0027m sorry, Selene, I don\u0027t mean to plague you with a sentimental attachment of an old Earthie - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s nothing old Earthie about your mind, Ben. There are other attachments than sexual. I like being with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause and Denison\u0027s smile faded, then returned, perhaps a thought more mechanically. \"I\u0027m glad for my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison looked away, shook his head slightly, then turned back. She watched him carefully, almost anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"Selene, there\u0027s more than energy involved in the cross-Universe leaks. I suspect you\u0027ve been thinking about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence stretched out now, painfully, and finally Selene said, \"Oh, that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while the two stared at each other - Denison embarrassed, Selene almost furtive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGottstein said, \"I haven\u0027t got my Moon-legs quite yet, but this isn\u0027t anything compared to what it cost me to get my Earth-legs. Denison, you had better not dream of returning. You\u0027ll never make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no intention of returning, Commissioner,\" said Denison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way, it\u0027s too bad. You could be emperor by acclamation. As for Hallam - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, wistfully, \"I would have liked to see his face, but that\u0027s a small ambition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lamont, of course, is receiving the lion\u0027s share. He\u0027s on the spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind that. He deserves a good deal. . . . Do you think Neville will really join us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question. He\u0027s on his way at this moment. . . . Listen,\" Gottstein\u0027s voice dropped one conspiratorial note in pitch. \"Before he comes, would you like a bar of chocolate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bar of chocolate. With almonds. One. I have some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison\u0027s face, from initial confusion, suddenly lit with comprehension. \"Real chocolate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certain - \" His face hardened. \"No, Commissioner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! If I taste real chocolate then, for the few minutes It\u0027s in my mouth, I\u0027m going to miss Earth; I\u0027m going to miss everything about it. I can\u0027t afford that. I don\u0027t want it. . . . Don\u0027t even show it to me. Don\u0027t let me smell it or see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commissioner looked discomfited. \"You\u0027re right.\" He made an obvious attempt to change the subject. \"The excitement on Earth is overwhelming. Of course, we made a considerable effort to save Hallam\u0027s face. He\u0027ll continue to hold some position of importance, but he\u0027ll have little real say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s getting more consideration than he gave others,\" said Denison, resignedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not for his sake. You can\u0027t smash a personal image that has been built to a level of such importance; it would reflect on science itself. The good name of science is more important than Hallam either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disapprove of that in principle,\" said Denison, warmly. \"Science must take what blows it deserves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A time and place for -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There\u0027s Dr. Neville.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGottstein composed his face. Denison shifted his\u0027 chair to face the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarron Neville entered solemnly. Somehow there was less than ever of the Lunar delicacy about his figure. He greeted the two curtly, sat down, and crossed his legs. He was clearly waiting for Gottstein to speak first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commissioner said, \"I am glad to see you, Dr. Neville, Dr. Denison tells me that you refused to append your name to what I am sure will be a classic paper on the cosmeg pump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to do so,\" said Neville. \"What happens on Earth is of no interest to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are aware of the cosmeg pump experiments? Of its implications?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them. I know the situation as well as you two do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will proceed without preliminaries. I have returned from Earth, Dr. Neville, and it is quite settled as to what will be the course of future procedure. Large cosmeg pump stations will be set up on three different places on the Lunar surface in such a way that one will always be in the night-shadow. Half the time, two win be. Those in the night-shadow will be constantly generating energy, most of which will simply radiate into space. The purpose will be not so much to use the energy for practical purposes, as to counteract the changes in field intensities introduced by the Electron Pump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison interrupted. \"For some years, we will have to overbalance the Electron Pump to restore our section of the Universe to the point at which it was before the pump began operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville nodded. \"Will Luna City have the use of any of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If necessary. We feel the Solar batteries will probably supply what you need, but there is no objection to supplementation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is land of you,\" said Neville, not bothering to mask the sarcasm. \"And who will build and run the cosmeg pump stations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunar workers, we hope,\" said Gottstein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunar workers, you know,\" said Neville. \"Earth workers would be too clumsy to work effectively on the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We recognize that,\" said Gottstein, \"We trust the men of the Moon will cooperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who will decide how much energy to generate, how much to apply for any local purpose, how much to radiate away? Who decides policy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGottstein said, \"The government would have to. It\u0027s a matter of planetary decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville said, \"You see, then, it will be Moonmen who do the work; Earthmen who run the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGottstein said, calmly, \"No. All of us work who work best; all of us administer who can best weigh the total problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear the words,\" said Neville, \"but it boils down anyway to us working and you deciding . . . No, Commissioner. Hie answer is no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you won\u0027t build the cosmeg pump stations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well build them, Commissioner, but they\u0027ll be ours. Well decide how much energy to put out and what use to make of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would scarcely be efficient. You would have to deal constantly with the Earth government since the cosmeg pump energy will have to balance the Electron Pump energy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dare say it will, more or less, but we have other things in mind. You might as well know now. Energy is not the only conserved phenomenon that becomes limitless once universes are crossed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison interrupted. \"There are a number of conservation laws. We realize that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you do,\" said Neville, turning a hostile glare in his direction. \"They include those of linear momentum and angular momentum. As long as any object responds to the gravitational field in which it is immersed, and to that only, it is in free fall and can retain its mass. In order to move in any other way than free fall, it must accelerate in a non-gravitational way and for that to happen, part of itself must undergo an opposite change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As in a rocketship,\" said Denison, \"which must eject mass in one direction in order that the rest might accelerate in the opposite direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you understand, Dr. Denison,\" said Neville, \"but I explain for the Commissioner\u0027s sake. The loss of mass can be minimized if its velocity is increased enormously, since momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity. Nevertheless, however great the velocity, some mass must be thrown away. If the mass which must be acceterated is enormous in the first place, then the mass which must be discarded is also enormous. If the Moon, for instance - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Moon!\" said Gottstein, explosively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the Moon,\" said Neville, calmly. \"If the Moon were to be driven out of its orbit and sent out of the Solar system, the conservation of momentum would make it a colossal undertaking, and probably a thoroughly impractical one. If, however, momentum could be transferred to the cosmeg in another Universe, the Moon could accelerate at any convenient rate without loss of mass at all. It would be like poling a barge upstream, to give you a picture I obtained from some Earth-book I once read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why? I mean why should you want to move the Moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should think that would be obvious. Why do we need the suffocating presence of the Earth? We have the energy we need; we have a comfortable world through which we have room to expand for the next few centuries, at least Why not go our own way? In any case, we will. I have come to tell you that you cannot stop us and to urge you to make no attempt to interfere. We shall transfer momentum and we shall pull out. We of the Moon know precisely how to go about building cosmeg pump stations. We will use what energy we need for ourselves and produce excess in order to neutralize the changes your own power stations are producing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, sardonically, \"It sounds kind of you to produce excess for our sake, but it isn\u0027t for our sake, of course. If our Electron Pumps explode the Sun, that will happen long before you can move out of even the inner Solar system and you will vaporize wherever you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" said Neville, \"but in any case we will produce an excess, so that won\u0027t happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can\u0027t do that,\" said Gottstein, excitedly. \"You can\u0027t move out. If you get out too far, the cosmeg pump will no longer neutralize the Electron Pump, eh, Denison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison shrugged. \"Once they are as far off as Saturn, more or less, there may be trouble, if I may trust a mental calculation I have just made. It will, however, be many years before they recede to such a distance and by that time, we will surely have constructed space stations in what was once the orbit of the Moon and place cosmeg pumps on them. Actually, we don\u0027t need the Moon. It can leave - except that it won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville smiled briefly. \"What makes you think we won\u0027t? We can\u0027t be stopped. There is no way Earthmen can impose their will on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t leave, because there\u0027s no sense to doing so. Why drag the entire Moon away? To build up respectable accelerations will take years where the Moon-mass is concerned. You\u0027ll creep. Build starships instead; miles-long ships that are cosmeg-powered and have independent ecologies. With a cosmeg momentum-drive, you can then do wonders. If it takes twenty years to build the ships, they will nevertheless accelerate at a rate that will enable them to overtake the Moon\u0027s place within a year even if the Moon starts accelerating today. The ships will be able to change course in a tiny fraction of the time the Moon will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the unbalanced cosmeg pumps? What will that do to the Universe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The energy required by a ship, or even by a number, will be far less than that required by a planet and will be distributed throughout large sections of the Universe. It will be millions of years before any significant change takes place. That is well worth the maneuverability you gain. The Moon will move so slowly it might as well be left in space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville said, scornfully, \"We\u0027re in no hurry to get anywhere - except away from Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"There are advantages in having Earth as a neighbor. You have the influx of the Immigrants. You have cultural intercourse. You have a planetary world of two billion people just over the horizon. Do you want to give all that up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gladly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true of the people of the Moon generally? Or just of you? There\u0027s something intense about you, Neville. You won\u0027t go out on the surface. Other Lunarites do. They don\u0027t like it particularly, but they do. The interior of the Moon isn\u0027t their womb, as it is in your case. It isn\u0027t their prison, as it is yours. There is a neurotic factor in you that is absent in most Lunarities, or at least considerably weaker. If you take the Moon away from Earth, you make it into a prison for all. It will become a one-world prison from which no man - and not you only - can emerge, not even to the extent of seeing another inhabited world in the sky. Perhaps that is what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want independence; a free world; a world untouched by the outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can build ships, any number. You can move outward at near-light velocities without difficulty, once you transfer momentum to the cosmeg. You can explore the entire Universe in a single lifetime. Wouldn\u0027t you like to get on such a ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Neville, with clear distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t you? Or is it couldn\u0027t? Is it that you must take the Moon with you wherever you go Why must all the others accept your need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because that\u0027s the way it\u0027s going to be,\" said Neville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison\u0027s voice remained level but his cheeks reddened. \"Who gave you the right to say that? There are many citizens of Luna City who may not feel as you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is none of your concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is precisely my concern. I am an Immigrant who will qualify for citizenship soon. I do not wish to have my choice made for me by someone who cannot emerge on the surface and who wants his personal prison made into a prison for all. I have left Earth forever, but only to come to the Moon, only to remain a quarter-million miles from the home-planet. I have not contracted to be taken forever away for an unlimited distance,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then return to Earth,\" said Neville, indifferently. \"There is still time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of the other citizens of Luna? The other Immigrants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The decision is made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not made. . . . Selene!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene entered, her face solemn, her eyes a little defiant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville\u0027s legs uncrossed. Both shoes came down flat upon the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville said, \"How long have you been waiting in the next room, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since before you arrived, Barron,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville looked from Selene to Denison and back again. \"You two - \" he began, finger pointing from one to the other and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you mean by you two,\u0027 \" said Selene, \"but Ben found out about the momentum quite a while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t Selene\u0027s fault,\" said Denison. \"The Commissioner spotted something flying at a time when no one could possibly have known he would be observing. It seemed to me that Selene might be testing something I was not thinking of and transfer of momentum eventually occurred to me. After that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, you knew,\" said Neville. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does, Barron,\" said Selene. \"I talked about it with Ben. I found that I didn\u0027t always have to accept what you said. Perhaps I can\u0027t ever go to Earth. Perhaps I don\u0027t even want to. But I found I liked it in the sky where I could see it if I wanted to, I didn\u0027t want an empty sky. Then I talked to others of the Group. Not everybody wants to leave. Most people would rather build the ships and let those go who wish to go while allowing those to remain behind who wish to remain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville\u0027s breath was coming hard. \"You talked about it. Who gave you the right to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took the right, Barron. Besides, it doesn\u0027t matter any more. You\u0027ll be outvoted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of - \" Neville rose to his feet and took a menacing step toward Denison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commissioner said, \"Please don\u0027t get emotional, Dr. Neville. You may be of Luna, but I don\u0027t think you can man-handle both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All three,\" said Selene, \"and I\u0027m of Luna, too. I did it, Barron; not they.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Denison said, \"Look, Neville -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;For all Earth cares, the Moon can go. Earth can build its space stations. It\u0027s the citizens of Luna City who care. Selene cares and I care and the rest You are not being debarred from space, from escape, from freedom. In twenty years at the outside, all who want to go will go, including you if you can bring yourself to leave the womb. And those who want to stay will stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Neville seated himself again. There was the look of defeat on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Selene\u0027s apartment, every window now had a view of the Earth. She said, \"The vote did go against him, you know, Ben. Quite heavily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that he\u0027ll give up, though. If there\u0027s friction with Earth during the building of the stations, public opinion on the Moon may swing back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There needn\u0027t be friction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, there needn\u0027t. In any case, there are no happy endings in history, only crisis points that pass. We\u0027ve passed this one safely, I think, and we\u0027ll be sorry about the others as they come and as they can be foreseen. Once the starships are built, the tension will surely subside considerably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll live to see that, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will, Selene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too, Ben. Don\u0027t overdramatize your age. You\u0027re only forty-eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you go on one of the starships, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027d be too old and I still wouldn\u0027t want to lose Earth in the sky. My son might go. . . . Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Selene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have applied for a second son. The application has been accepted. Would you contribute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison\u0027s eyes lifted and looked straight into hers. She did not look away. He said, \"Artificial insemination?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Of course. . . . The gene combination should be interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison\u0027s eyes dropped. \"I would be flattered, Selene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, defensively, \"That\u0027s just good sense, Ben. It\u0027s important to have good gene combinations. There\u0027s nothing wrong with some natural genetic engineering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t mean that I don\u0027t want it for other reasons, too. . . . Because I like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison nodded and remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, almost angrily, \"Well, there\u0027s more to love than sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"I agree to that At least, I love you even with sex subtracted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Selene said, \"And for that matter, there\u0027s more to sex than acrobatics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"I agree to that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Selene said, \"And besides -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Oh, damn it, you could try to learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said softly, \"If you would try to teach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitantly, he moved toward her. She did not move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped hesitating. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-26.html","bookId":1744,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM"}
