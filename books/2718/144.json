With a war cry, Balder advances on the snow globers, wielding that piece of driftwood like the badass warrior he is inside. One guy’s coming after me full speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs and lungs burn, and I stumble. I try to get back up, but I’m having a hard time. My E-ticket meter’s nearly blank—there’s just a tiny shred of Tomorrowland hanging on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cameron!” Dulcie’s here, reaching out. “Hold on!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her hand and we’re flying over the beach. I wrap my legs around her. “Whoa!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDulcie turns my face to hers. “Just don’t look down and don’t let go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me. I will not do either of those things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething zips past. Dulcie cries out and we’re tumbling through the air. We land in the sand. Dulcie’s curled up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bad landing.” She sits up, grabbing her shoulder. Singed feathers fall from her wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, a bullet zips past. A USGW employee is making his way through the sand, gun glinting in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grab hold,” Dulcie croaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t fly like that. Can you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDulcie doesn’t wait. She draws me to her and we sort of half fly, half trot on the beach. But with Dulcie’s injured wing, we can’t get enough lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahhhh!” A bullet grazes Dulcie’s other wing and we drop onto the pier. “Run out!” Dulcie instructs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I pull her. We’re bordered on all sides by the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tries to smile, but I can see the pain in her eyes. “The water, Cameron.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No water,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that a sure thing or a destiny-can-be-changed thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t answer. “Cameron,” she whispers. It’s like the cooing of doves. Her wings smell of rain and smoke. She pushes me hard and I fly backward into the ocean. The water’s cold and heavy, like being wrapped in a blanket soaked with snow. Feels like I’m going to drown, like when I was five. Dulcie’s on the edge of the pier. United Snow Globe Employee #457 aims a long gun with a spray nozzle at her. “Gotcha,” he growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDulcie closes her eyes as he hits the trigger. There’s a blinding flash. When it clears, Dulcie’s gone. Where she was standing, there’s nothing but a snow globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dulcie!” I scream. “Dulcie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re next.” Employee #457 aims the nozzle at my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and let the ocean carry me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cameron? Look at that! Isn’t it wonderful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom’s pointing to a marionette Inuit boy pulling a fish out of the hole again and again. The snow glistens. A kids’ choir sings that it’s a small world after all. It’s the most amazing thing, this ride. I love it. I want to go on it again and again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to play in the snow!” I tell Mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to stay in the boat, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI notice a tiny door behind the igloo. “Where does that door go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don’t know. Somewhere. Oooh, isn’t that cute?” Mom points out a dancing girl to Jenna. Dad puts his arm around me. I’m here and I’m safe with my mom and dad and sister. But I can’t help it. I want to know where the door goes. I want to play. Over there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I’m in the water, going under. Above me the surface gleams with color and light. Muffled screaming filters down. But it’s peaceful here, and I could just reach out and touch that other shore. My lungs can’t hold back anymore. I open my mouth and the water rushes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a loud gasp, I break the waves and stagger toward the sand. Employee #457 is waiting with the weird gun in one hand and the Dulcie snow globe in the other. “Knew you couldn’t stay down there forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give … her … back,” I pant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. She’s a threat that must be contained. Now. Smile pretty. Maybe we’ll call this one Beach Break.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers the nozzle. I hear it making a weird wheeeeee sound as it fires up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the creep!” The motorcycle guy is back with the bicycle cops. “He was trying to kidnap a kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Officer, you’ve got it wrong. I’m working with United Snow Globe Wholesalers.” The vigilante points to his cap. “We’re working to protect your safety!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wail of sirens fills my ears. Cops scramble down the dunes and cuff the snow globe guy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-bovine/page-144.html","bookId":2718,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM"}
