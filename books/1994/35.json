The club had a lot less traffic and because of this tips were down. The biggest thing was that Rush hadn\u0027t mentioned the proposing thing again since the night at the condo when he\u0027d said that was what he\u0027d told his mother and sister and my father. He never even mentioned them again. I wondered sometimes if he\u0027d changed his mind or if I\u0027d imagined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it wasn\u0027t for Bethy asking me weekly if Rush had brought it up again I would think it had been a figment of my imagination. Every time I told her no he hadn\u0027t she got more and more agitated. Not to mention my heart hurt a little more. I was afraid he\u0027d thought it through and decided it was a mistake. Before he\u0027d mentioned it that night I hadn\u0027t even let myself believe he\u0027d want to marry me. I figured we\u0027d raise the baby from two different homes. If my thoughts went to the future I would block it out. It wasn\u0027t something I wanted to hope for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hours were being cut back due to the slower season and I wondered if I needed to get a second job. There wasn\u0027t a lot to choose from around here. Then it was very likely that Rush wouldn\u0027t take it well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stepped into my bedroom there were two things that caught my attention. There were rose petals on my bed and in the center of them was an envelope with my name written neatly across the front. I picked it up and opened it. The stationery was expensive feeling and Finlay was embossed at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me down at the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis abnormally perfect handwriting made me smile. I went to my closet and pulled out a white sundress that had two black stripes across the hem. If he had planned a romantic something at the beach I wasn\u0027t going to wear my work clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter brushing my hair and touching up my makeup I headed out the French doors that faced the gulf and made my way down to the beach. Rush was dressed in a pair of khaki shorts and a button up shirt. I was glad I\u0027d changed. His back was to me and his hands were in his pockets as he stood there staring out at the water. I wanted to stop and admire him admiring the water but I was also anxious to see him. He\u0027d been gone when I woke up this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped off the walkway and onto the sand. It was oddly deserted except for the two of us. Even though the crowds were down it was still eighty-eight degrees and sunny outside. Glancing down I noticed something in the sand. Someone had written in it. There was a stick lying off to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped and read aloud, \"Blaire Wynn, will you marry me?\" As the words sunk in Rush walked across the words and knelt down on one knee in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small box appeared in his hand and he opened it slowly as a diamond ring caught the fading sun.It appeared to come alive as it sparkled. It was happening. Did I want this? Yes. Did I trust him? .... Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he ready? I wasn\u0027t sure. I didn\u0027t want this to be something he was doing because he felt pressured to. It would be easy to reach down and put the ring on my finger. But was it what Rush really wanted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do this,\" I forced myself to say staring down at him. He hadn\u0027t spoken to his sister or his mother in weeks. As much as I disliked them... no hated them, I didn\u0027t want to be what came between him and his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush shook his head. \"No, I don\u0027t have to do anything. But I want to spend the rest of my life with you. No one but you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were the right words. I still felt like something was wrong. He couldn\u0027t truly want this. He was young, rich, and gorgeous. I had nothing to offer him. I\u0027d tie him down. Change his world. \"I can\u0027t do this to you. I can\u0027t hinder your future. You can go do anything. I promised you I\u0027d let you be a part of our baby\u0027s life. That won\u0027t change when you feel like you\u0027re ready to leave. I\u0027ll always let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say another word. I swear Blaire, I am seconds away from throwing your ass in that ocean.\" He stood up and his steady gaze held mine. \"No man has ever loved a woman as much as I love you. Nothing will ever come before you. I don\u0027t know what else I have to do to prove to you that I won\u0027t let you down again. I won\u0027t hurt you. You don\u0027t have to be alone anymore. I need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this wasn\u0027t right and maybe I was making a mistake but his words tugged at corners of my heart he had somehow not managed to reach until that moment. I took the box from his hand and lifted the ring free. \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" I told him. Because it was. It wasn\u0027t too flashy or overdone. It was perfectly simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing less would be worthy of your finger,\" he replied and took the ring from my hand. Then he went back down on his knee and his eyes met mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Blaire Wynn, will you be my wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted this. Him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said and he slipped the ring on my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank god,\" he whispered then stood back up and captured my mouth in a hungry kiss. This was real and maybe it wouldn\u0027t be forever but it was mine for now. I\u0027d find a way to let him go if he wanted to. But I loved him. That would never change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move in with me,\" he begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I have to pay my half of the lease,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I paid your lease in full for a year. Every dime you\u0027ve given Woods has gone into a savings account with your name on it. Same for Bethy. Now, please move in with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to get mad at him but right now I couldn\u0027t. I pressed another kiss to his lips and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And please stop working,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I replied. I wasn\u0027t doing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my fiance now. You\u0027re going to be my wife. Why do you want to work at a country club? Don\u0027t you want to do something else? What about college? Do you want to do that? Is there a degree you want? I\u0027m not trying to take away your choices; I want to give you more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to be his wife. Those words sunk in as I gazed up at him. I didn\u0027t have to give up college like I had high school. I could get a degree and have a profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want that. It\u0027s just... let me soak this in. Too much, too fast,\" I said, wrapping my arms around him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-35.html","bookId":1994,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM"}
