And others. \"Perrin?\" He knew that voice. \"Perrin, lad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Luhhan? Perrin’s eyelids felt so heavy. He couldn’t open them. Arms grabbed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on. I have you, lad. I have you. Hang on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Last Battle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn broke that morning on Polov Heights, but the sun did not shine on the Defenders of the Light. Out of the west and out of the north came the armies of Darkness, to win this one last battle and cast a Shadow across the earth; to usher in an Age where the wails of suffering would go unheard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—from the notebook of Loial, son of Arent son of Halan, the Fourth Age\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan held his sword aloft as he galloped Mandarb through camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove, the morning clouds began to bleed red, reflecting enormous fireballs rising from the massive Sharan army that was approaching from the west. They arced in the sky gracefully, seeming slow because of the great distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroups of riders broke out of the camp, joining Lan. The remaining Malkieri rode just behind him, but his force had swelled like a tide. Andere joined him at the front, the flag of Malkier—the Golden Crane—acting as a banner for all of the Borderlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been bloodied, but not beaten. Knock a man down, and you saw what he was made of. That man might run. If he didn’t—if he stood back up with blood at the corner of his mouth and determination in his eyes then you knew. That man was about to become truly dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fireballs seemed to move more quickly as they dropped, crashing to the camp in bursts of red fury. Explosions shook the ground. Nearby screams rose to accompany the thunder of hoofbeats. Still men joined him. Mat Cauthon had spread word through all of the camps that more cavalry were needed to join Lan’s advance and replace lost soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had also disclosed the cost of doing so. The cavalry would be at the forefront of the fighting, breaking Trolloc and Sharan lines, and would find little rest. They’d carry the brunt of the casualties this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, men joined him. Borderlanders who should have been too old to ride. Merchants who had put aside the money pouch and taken up the sword. A surprising number of southerners, including many women, wearing breastplates and steel or leather caps, carrying spears. There weren’t enough lances to go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half of those joining look like farmers more than soldiers!\" Andere called to him over the hoofbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever seen a man or woman from the Two Rivers ride, Andere?\" Lan yelled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can’t say that I have\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch and be surprised\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan’s cavalry reached the River Mora, where a man with long, curling hair, wearing a black coat, stood with hands clasped behind his back. Logain now had forty Aes Sedai and Asha’man with him. He eyed Lan’s force, then raised a hand toward the sky, crumpling an enormous falling fireball as if it were a piece of paper. The sky cracked like lightning, and the breaking fireball gushed sparks to every side, smoke churning in the air. Ashes drifted down, burning out, hitting the rushing river and scattering black and white on its surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan slowed Mandarb as he approached Hawal Ford, just south of the Heights. Logain thrust his other hand toward the river. The waters churned, then lurched up into the air as if flowing over an invisible ramp. They crashed down on the other side, a violent waterfall, while some of the water spilled over the banks of the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan nodded to Logain and continued on, guiding Mandarb under the waterfall and crossing the still-wet rocks of the ford. Sunlight filtered through the river waters above, sparkling down on Lan as he thundered through the tunnel, Andere and the Malkieri behind him. The waterfall roared down to his left, spraying a mist of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan shivered as he burst back out into the light, then charged through the corridor toward the Sharans. To his right rose the Heights, to his left the bogs, but there was a passage of solid, level ground here. Up on the Heights, archers, crossbowmen and dragoners prepared to release volleys at the oncoming foes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharans at the front, a huge force of Trollocs gathering up behind, all directly west of the Heights. The thunder of dragonfire shook the air from the top of the Heights, and soon the Sharans had explosions of their own to contend with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan set his lance, took aim at a Sharan soldier charging toward Polov Heights, then braced himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne whipped her head up, turning to the side. That terrible song, a croon, a hum, beautiful yet terrible at the same time. She heeled Moonshadow, drawn toward that soft sound. Where was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rose from somewhere deeper in the Seanchan camp at the base of Dashar Knob. Chewing out Mat for not telling her his plan of war could wait. She needed to find the source of that sound, that wonderful sound, that . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elayne!\" Birgitte said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne kicked her horse forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elayne! Draghkar!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraghkar. Elayne shook herself, then looked up to find the creatures falling like drops of water into the camp around them. Guardswomen lowered their swords, eyes opening wide as the crooning continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne wove a thunderclap. It burst from her, splitting the air, washing across the Guardswomen and making them cry out and cover their ears. Pain stabbed Elayne’s head and she cursed, closing her eyes at the shock. And then . . . then she heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced her eyes open to see Draghkar all around, with their spindly bodies and inhuman eyes. They opened their lips to croon, but Elayne’s deafened ears could not hear the song. She smiled, then wove whips of fire, striking the creatures down. She could not hear their screeches of pain, which was a pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne’s Guardswomen rallied, rising from knees, lowering hands from ears. She could tell from their dazed looks that they had been deafened. Birgitte soon had them striking at the surprised Draghkar. Three of the creatures tried to leap up and fly away, but Birgitte took each one with a white-fletched arrow, dropping the last so that it crashed into a nearby tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne waved, getting Birgitte’s attention. The first Draghkar sounds hadn’t come from above, but from farther into camp. Elayne pointed, kicking Moonshadow into motion, leading her troops among the Seanchan. All about, men lay staring into the sky, mouths open. Many seemed to be breathing, but they stared with dead eyes. The Draghkar had consumed their souls, but left the bodies alive, like the crust cut off a rich mans bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSloppy. This group of Draghkar—Light, there were well over a hundred of them—could have taken a man each, killed him, then retreated before their presence was discovered. The distant roars of the battle—the bleating horns, the booming dragons, the hissing fireballs, all of which Elayne now felt but could only barely make out with her broken ears—had covered the Draghkar attack. The creatures could have struck and fl \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-210.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
