His hands grasped her shoulders, tightening as he urged her closer. His eyes seemed to darken as his mouth made a slow descent toward hers, stopping a mere fraction from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie closed her eyes, and his warm breath caressed her face. She inhaled the pungent scent of surgical soap and something else, something that was ineffably him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We shouldn’t be doing this,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt certainly wasn’t what she’d expected him to say. “I…know,” she said, but she was beyond listening to common sense. She needed Colby. His warmth, his comfort, his touch. And she wouldn’t be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driving force of his kiss parted her lips, and Valerie was instantly caught in a whirlwind of sensation. Her hands reached for him, sliding up his solid chest, her fingers locking at the base of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moaned, and she did, too. There was no resistance in Valerie, none. She surrendered herself to his kiss, to his need and her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith what seemed like reluctance, he broke away and slipped his mouth from hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt cold when he lifted his face. Opening her eyes, she glanced toward the waiting room, grateful to see that it was empty. They were alone in the shadows of the hedge, but a few seconds earlier it wouldn’t have mattered if they’d been standing in the middle of the bustling emergency room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shouldn’t have let that happen. We both—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie placed her finger over his lips, silencing him. “Don’t say it. Please.” Her hands cupped his face and she gazed into his eyes, dark now with desire. “I need you. Right or wrong, I need you. Just hold me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint quiver went through her as he brought her back into his arms. Closing her eyes again, Valerie surrendered to the strength and safety she felt in his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her forehead lightly. His breath was uneven, and she found pleasure in knowing that he was no less affected by their encounter than she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she’d already told him, Valerie didn’t want to question the right or wrong of it now. Neither of them was in any real danger of falling in love. Colby had explained the reasons a relationship between them was unfeasible. And she agreed with him. But their calm, rational words didn’t take into account what she was experiencing. This excitement, this weightless sense of release and longing. She didn’t want it to end. Apparently Colby didn’t, either, because he made no move to let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t feel so good in my arms,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.” But she wasn’t, not really. Soon they’d both regret this, but she’d save all the remorse for another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was in Colby’s embrace, she didn’t have to think about the future. She didn’t have to worry about facing the world without anyone to guide and support her. For the first time since she’d come home to Orchard Valley, Valerie didn’t feel inadequate or alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue, Norah was with her and Steffie was due to arrive soon. The three of them had each other, yet Valerie couldn’t quite escape the old roles; she was the one they’d always depended on for encouragement, guidance, a sense of strength. Only Valerie didn’t feel strong. She felt shaken, knocked off balance. She felt completely helpless….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Norah’s looking for you,” Colby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie sighed and grudgingly broke away from him. She peered into the waiting room and noticed her younger sister. Norah’s eyes found her at the same time. She didn’t do a good job of concealing her shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie stood and turned to Colby. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remained sitting on the concrete bench and sent her a smile full of private meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorah met her at the door, eyes shifting from Valerie to Colby. “Is everything all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie nodded. “Dad’s holding his own at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t mean Dad. I meant with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Valerie answered, forcing a casual tone. “I…just needed a good cry, and Colby lent me his shoulder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorah slipped her arm around Valerie’s waist. “His shoulder, you say?” she asked, with more than a hint of a smile. “It looked like more than that to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the following night, and once again Valerie and Norah had taken up residence in the waiting room. Several small groups of people were scattered about the area, either silent or speaking quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad’s been asleep for nearly twenty hours.” Valerie voiced her concern to Norah, who was far more knowledgeable about what was and wasn’t usual after this kind of surgery. “Isn’t that too long? I realize the anesthesia has a lot to do with it, but I can’t help worrying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s been awake for brief periods off and on today,” Norah said. “He’s doing very well, all things considered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father wasn’t Valerie’s only concern. It was now after nine in the evening, and she’d been waiting since morning for some word from Steffie, who was supposed to be arriving sometime that day. But no one had heard from her, and Valerie felt anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad tried to talk the last time I was with him,” Norah told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “It didn’t make any sense. He looked up at me and grinned as if he’d heard the funniest joke in years and said ‘six kids.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t get it, either,” Norah murmured. “I’m going to ask Colby about it when I see him, but we keep missing each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie sat down and thumbed through the frayed pages of a two-year-old women’s magazine. It was a summer issue dedicated to homes and gardens, which only went to prove how desperate she was for reading material that would take her mind off her fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at photographs of bright glossy kitchens and “country” bedrooms, wicker-furnished porches and “minimal” living rooms—all of them attractive, none of them quite real. None of them home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she knew with sudden certainty that home was here. Here in Orchard Valley at the family house. In the upstairs bedroom at the end of the hallway. Home was curling up with a good book by the fireplace in her father’s den, and it was eating meals around the big oak table in the dining room her mother had loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was home. She lived in her Houston condo in an exclusive neighborhood. She’d had a decorator choose the color scheme and select the furniture, since she didn’t have the time for either task. A housekeeper came in twice a week to clean. The condo was a place to sleep. An address where she could pick up her mail. But it wasn’t a place of memories and it wasn’t home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read an article in the same magazine about herb gardens. Gardening had always been her mother’s hobby, but every now and then Valerie had helped her weed. The times they’d spent working in the garden were among the fondest memories she had of her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps in an attempt to recapture some of that simple happiness, Valerie had bought several large plants for her condo. But the housekeeper was the one who watered and fertilized them, since Valerie traveled so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither a home, at least not like the one she’d been raised in, nor a garden seemed to be in her future. Colby had recognized that from the beginning. Just as well, although it hadn’t warded off the magnetic attraction between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie’s mind wandered to their exchange the night before. Their kissing was undoubtedly a mistake, but it was understandable and certainly forgivable. Both were emotionally drained, their resistance to each other almost nonexistent. Yet Valerie couldn’t bring herself to regret the time she’d spent in Colby’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt a bit that he was avoiding her, because it told her he didn’t share her feelings. In those moments with Colby, Valerie had experienced something extraordinary. She’d always considered romantic love a highly overrated commodity. Dr. Colby Winston was the first man who’d given her reason to reevaluate that opinion—despite the fact that a relationship between them had no possible future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when she was beginning to think he planned never to seek her out again, Colby surprised her. Norah had gone to talk with the nurse who’d been assigned to care for their father, and Valerie sat alone in the SICU waiting room, shuffling through her thoughts. Colby was on her mind just then—not that he was ever far from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe happened to glance up as he walked in. He was wearing a dark gray suit; she didn’t think she’d ever seen a handsomer man. Not even Rowdy Cassidy…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes met and held. “Hello,” she said, with a breathless quality to her voice. Over the course of her career, Valerie had made presentations before large audiences. Her voice carried well, yet with Colby she felt like a first-grader asked to stand before the class and confess a wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valerie.” He paused and cleared his throat, then began again, sounding stilted and formal. “I’ve tied up everything here and I’m addressing a seminar this evening at the university. However, I have time for a bite to eat before I leave. Would you join me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d be happy to,” she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we should eat someplace other than the cafeteria.” His voice was more relaxed now. “There’s an Italian restaurant near here that serves excellent food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great.” Valerie brightened until she realized he hadn’t chosen the restaurant because he had a craving for spaghetti. He wanted to talk to her somewhere away from the hospital. Somewhere he could be assured none of his peers would be listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving a message for Norah, they left the hospital in his car, a late-model maroon sedan. Sitting beside him, watching his strong, well-shaped hands on the steering wheel, gave Valerie a sense of intimacy, a feeling of familiarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant, a fairly new place she’d never visited before, was elegantly decorated in black and silver. The lighting, low and discreet, created a welcoming ambience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t need to pay for my dinner to apologize, you know,” Valerie said, reading over her menu. She quickly decided on a bowl of minestrone soup and fettuccine with fresh asparagus. No wine, because it would send her to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apologize?” Colby repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie lowered her menu and, crossing her arms, leaned toward him. “Not apologize exactly. You brought me here to tell me you’re sorry about what happened last night, didn’t you? I mean, it’s fairly obvious, since you’ve been avoiding me all day. But don’t worry about it,” she said off-handedly, “I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled and set aside his menu. “Sometimes I forget how direct you can be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d rather have everything out in the open. There’s no need to concern yourself with…what happened. I—needed you, and you were there for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scowl intensified. “In other words, any man would have suited your purposes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said. “Only you. What we shared was very…sweet. I’ll always be grateful to you for letting me cry.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/orchard-valley-grooms-orchard-valley-0/page-11.html","bookId":1979,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:04 AM"}
