But it wasn’t enough to save her. Nevare, Captain Thayer has sentenced her to hang tomorrow. And he has sentenced himself to receive fifty lashes for conduct unbecoming an officer. He was so calm when he announced it, like he welcomed the opportunity. He spoke like he was giving an address, saying that he was going to accept the responsibility for failing his men and leading them into evil that night. He said that the good god had already punished many of them, that the Speck raid was the good god cleansing evil from our midst. And he said he would finish what the good god had begun, with an act of atonement for his role in the evil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That wasn’t the good god. That was the Specks, plain and simple.” I swallowed and then forced the truth from my lips. “That was me. Soldier’s Boy me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpink made no response to my words. As the silence stretched, I finally found my voice. “I was there that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpink stared off into the distance. His voice was tight when he said, “I know. I saw you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that you didn’t kill me, when you could have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—” he began, and then stopped again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My other self, my Speck self. He planned the raid. He targeted Thayer’s men. That was the first barracks we went to. I couldn’t stop him, Spink, or I would have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You—he butchered them. Like animals in a slaughterhouse chute. They were found in a heap near the charred ruins. They never had a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I was there. But I swear, Spink, it wasn’t me. I’ll swear by anything you like. I could not have done it.” I gave a strangled laugh. “He took all my hatred and lust for vengeance. And he seems to have kept it. Even now, I cannot rouse the hatred I should feel for Thayer. All I can think is that he was caught up by all of it, just as I was. Tortured and twisted by the magic. Made to do its will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpink swallowed. “Perhaps I hate him enough for both of us. I liked him, when I first got here. He was a good officer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t doubt that,” I said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are we going to do about Amzil?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Do you really think Thayer would hang a woman? Would the other officers stand by while he did that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Spink could reply, Kesey returned with a dripping bucket of cold water. Spink drank deeply and thanked him. Then Epiny emerged from the cabin. Her smile blossomed at the sight of Spink and me sitting together. As she came toward us, carrying her sleeping baby and making motions that we should keep quiet, she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her. She was thin, and her hair was still in a shambles from the cart ride. Her dress was not stylish and it was dusty from the trip. But her face glowed with love and satisfaction, and it broke my heart that Spink’s news was going to destroy that for her as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had gone only a few steps before she read trouble in Spink’s face. Her smile faded as she hurried up to him. “What is it? Are the children all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kesey, I’ll need to borrow that shirt, if I may,” I said to him. I think he was just as glad to withdraw as I was while Spink recounted the disaster to Epiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I emerged from the cabin wearing a shirt that wouldn’t button around my neck and a pair of trousers that were too short for me, tears were running down Epiny’s face. She leaned on Spink, not sobbing but silently weeping. Spink held his daughter and patted his wife’s shoulder. I put my old clothes and my nondescript sword into the back of the cart. I turned to Kesey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go back to town with them. Kesey, I’ll never be able to repay you for what you’ve done for me today. But that won’t stop me from trying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I didn’t do anything big for you, Nevare. Just what a man does for his fellow soldier.” He cocked his head at me. “You going to try to clear your name? I’d sure like that. You could come back and take your cabin and your job back; you’re much better at it than I am. I actually miss living in the barracks; you believe that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I believe it.” I shook his hand, then clapped him on the shoulder. “I don’t know what I’m going to do, Kesey. But thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, whatever you decide to do, let me know this time, will you? A man should know where his friends are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed. A man should know where his friends are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And, Nevare. I heard what the Lieutenant said, and I’m sorry that the Dead—that that woman is in trouble. I hope you can get to the bottom of it and get it straightened out. Sorry I called her that name, earlier. I didn’t know.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/renegade-s-magic-the-soldier-son-trilogy-3/page-248.html","bookId":2015,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM"}
