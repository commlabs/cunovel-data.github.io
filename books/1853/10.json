To my best friend, Carter. May he never fall victim to another two-timing, gold-digging whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe downed the shots and slapped the glasses on the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for not f**king her buddy,\" I mumbled, trying not to slur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dude, first of all, I\u0027d never f**k any girl you were even remotely interested in, let alone dating for a long period of time. And second, I could never accept a proposition from that skank. I wouldn\u0027t do that to my penis. He\u0027s done nothing wrong and doesn\u0027t deserve the punishment of her vagina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, smacked my elbows on top of the bar and rested my head in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My poor penis. I should buy him a gift,\" I muttered to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding out my girlfriend of two years was cheating on me two days before we were supposed to move here together and start a new life was a huge pain in my ass. And my penis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew\u0027s grief counselor, the waitress, walked back over to console him and interrupted my penis pity party. At the same time, a rush of air surrounded me as someone quickly walked by, their shoes clicking on the hardwood floor. I breathed in right at that moment and the smell of chocolate overwhelmed me and instantly transported me back in time to five years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmmm you smell so good. Like chocolate chip cookies,\" I muttered with a raspy, hung-over voice as I pulled her incredibly soft body against my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, she doesn\u0027t have any bones. Like, at all. Where the f**k are her bones? Am I still drunk? Did I sleep with a blow-up doll? Again? I pealed my eyes open one at a time so the rays of sun shining in the room wouldn\u0027t make me go blind. Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked down and groaned. Nope, not drunk, just hugging a pillow. I let go of the pillow, rolling over onto my back and flinging my arm out to the side of me to stare up at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gone. And I didn\u0027t even get her name. What kind of a dick was I? She wasn\u0027t too interested in knowing my name either though, so I guess we were even. As drunk as I was last night, I could remember every single second. I closed my eyes and pulled to mind how great her ass looked in those jeans, the smell of her skin, the sound of her laugh and the way her body felt like it was made to fit against mine. I scanned through every memory I had, but for some reason, her face just wouldn\u0027t come into focus no matter how hard I tried. God dammit, how was I going to find her if I couldn\u0027t remember her face and didn\u0027t know her name? I was the king of jackasses. I knew she was beautiful, even if I couldn\u0027t remember everything. Her skin was soft and her hair felt like silk and her lips on me could make me whimper like a girl. And best of all, she made me laugh. Not many girls made me laugh. They never got my jokes or were too uptight for my sense of humor. But she got me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night obviously wasn\u0027t my best performance. I hope to God I didn’t have whiskey dick and was able to at least get it up and keep it up. Shit. She probably ran out of here as fast as she could this morning because I sucked so badly. I never had a one-night-stand before; I didn\u0027t know what the protocol was for something like this. Would it be wrong for me to hunt her down? Even if she wanted nothing to do with me ever again, I needed to at least apologize for my God-awful skills last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd truth be told, I just wanted to see her again. I wanted to know if she was real or if I just imagined how perfect she was. I grabbed the pillow and brought it up to my face, breathing the smell of chocolate in deep and smiling. I might not have remembered everything, but I remembered her smell. It was like hot chocolate on a cold winter’s day, chocolate cake baking in an oven on a rainy afternoon…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God, I sound like a chick. I need to watch some ESPN and get in a bar fight, pronto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the toilet flushing in the connecting bathroom had me bolting upright in bed. Holy shit! Was that her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung my legs around off the bed and started to get up right when the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking hell dude, don\u0027t ever sleep in a bathtub. That shit is for the birds. My ass is killing me,\" Drew complained as he shuffled over to the bed, turned around and let his body fall back onto the end, settling after a few bounces. He threw his arm over his eyes and groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the f**k does morning have to come so early?\" he whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed in disappointment, holding the sheet in place so I could lean over and grab my jeans that were crumpled on the floor with my boxer-briefs still shoved inside them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m never drinking again,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that last week,\" I reminded him as I flung the sheet off of me so I could put my pants on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat. The. Fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit. Fucking shit. Mother f**king shit balls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0027t be good. This really, really cannot be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you whining about over there, Nancy?\" Drew asked as he removed his arm from across his eyes and sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dick is bleeding. Drew – MY DICK IS BLEEDING!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was screeching like a girl. I knew it, he knew it, pretty soon the whole house would know it. But my dick was bleeding. Did you hear me? My f**king dick was f**king bleeding. FUCK! It\u0027s not supposed to bleed. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was having a heart attack. I couldn\u0027t breathe. I didn\u0027t know much, but I did know the rules about owning a dick. Rule number one: It should never bleed. Rule number two: There was no rule number two. IT SHOULD NEVER FUCKING BLEED. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-10.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
