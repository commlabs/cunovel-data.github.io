I drew the mottled cloak tighter around me, though I could not really believe in its powers of disguise. It was only a cloak, after all…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree steps left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI surged forward with renewed effort. In front of me, I could see Mr Ambrose and Karim appearing out of the gloom. They were pressed against the brick wall of number 97. Closing my eyes, I leapt forward. If I was to get shot at the last moment, I didn’t want to see the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed into something hard - much harder than a brick wall! From above me, I heard a sharp exhalation, and then, suddenly, a set of arms was around me, pulling me to a chest that felt wonderfully familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe that’s because you’ve been pressed up against it twice already in the last hour!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, he wasn’t holding me to shut my mouth, though, and my back wasn’t to his front. Instead, the hard muscles of his chest were pressed more tightly against mine than they had ever been before. He was holding me so tightly, I thought he didn’t ever want to let go again. I would not have minded if he never did. I felt so overjoyed to still be alive, and here, and with him…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange feeling flooded my body. A feeling of heat and weakness and wanting… something. From one moment to the next, I went limp in his arms, collapsing against his chest with a faint sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is happening? Lilly to legs: start working again, now! Right now, do you hear me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove me, I heard him catch his breath. And then, something happened which I would never have thought possible, certainly not here. Not now. His hands started roaming over my body, expertly probing my face, my neck, my arms, my… oh my!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart beginning to beat a frantic rhythm, my legs wobbled and almost gave way. His hands travelled farther down, over my waist, down my hips and to my legs… wait a minute! What did he want down there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes fluttered open, just in time to see him straighten and give me a cold, questioning glance. ‘Why did you sag against me?’ he demanded in a low, burning cold voice. ‘I have checked everywhere and cannot detect a single sign of a shot wound! Have you sprained your ankle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecking for shot wounds? He was checking for shot wounds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Um… no.’ Hurriedly, I straightened, hoping that with my tanned complexion and in the gloom of night, nobody could see my furious blush. ‘I was just exhausted from the run, I suppose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a soft noise in his throat that combined a minimum use of his vocal cords with a maximum of male scorn. Then he turned to Karim, who had been watching everything with narrowed eyes. The minute Mr Ambrose turned towards him, his features became as neutral as Switzerland, though they remained considerably hairier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Ambrose didn’t speak, but made a few, quick, hard gestures with his hand. Obviously, they must have meant something to Karim, who unslung the bag from over his shoulder and opened it. From its depth, he retrieved… was it a rifle? My eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he going to shoot at the guards on the wall?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. Mr Ambrose was many things, but not a fool. And now that Karim lifted the thing up, I could see more clearly. Contrasted against the moon that rose above the roofs to the north, I could see that, while the object had the same basic shape as a rifle, two slightly curved arms extended from it, one on each side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was something pointy at the end, some kind of arrow with a strange head. What in heaven’s name…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sharp snapping noise, the strange arrow flew upwards and over the wall. Behind it, a sort of tail was flailing in all directions. No - no tail, a rope!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to strain my ears to hear the dull thud as the arrow landed beyond the wall. And even so, I only heard it because I knew it was coming. The racket from the other side of the building was still overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Ambrose made another one of his cutting, silent gestures. I raised an eyebrow, quizzically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That means “move”,’ he hissed. ‘Now move.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I bet he wished he could use that strange sign language in the office! Then he wouldn’t have to talk to me at all, or write, but could just order me about with a twitch of his hand. And what did he mean, move? Move where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarim was in motion already. With two steps he was at the rope. Giving it a hearty tug, he tested whether it sat well. Apparently not displeased, he gripped it with both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, the significance of the rope hit me. Blimey! He was expecting me to climb up there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBracing his massive legs against the wall, the Mohammedan began to climb, determinedly. Soon, he had vanished into the darkness above me. Mr Ambrose followed, swift and graceful. And I…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I followed, too. Probably more determined than swift or graceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter only half a yard or so, my arms began to scream in protest. My palms were on fire, bitten with the hot teeth of the coarse rope from which I hung like a leg of mutton from a meat hook. Clenching my teeth and ignoring the pain, I took one of my hands from the rope and reached upwards. Thank God I was wearing men’s clothes! The weight of my usual collection of petticoats would have been enough to drag me to my doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway up the rope I decided that, yes, my derrière was too fat. I really had to do something about it. Not for the sake of appealing to Mr Ambrose! No, not at all! Simply for the sake of rope climbing. Maybe I should eat less solid chocolate…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree quarters of the way up, I looked towards the sky, only to see Mr Ambrose’s face above me. He made another sign at me, which I immediately understood: Hurry up! What are you dangling down there for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my teeth again, wishing I had enough breath for a solid, unladylike curse, and reached up once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I felt another hand close around mine and pull me up. It was a hand I knew well. Strong, smooth and hard. Mr Ambrose’s hand. His other hand closed around my wrist and heaved. Maybe he groaned a little more than was strictly necessary. My derrière might be a little generous, but I wasn’t that heavy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had just gotten my feet on solid ground once more, when Mr Ambrose grabbed my shoulders, pushing me forward and down. Before I knew what had happened, we were cowering on a stone staircase leading up to the wall, and looking over the edge of the walkway. Immediately, I saw why Mr Ambrose had pushed me. At the other end of the walkway, a soldier in red uniform had just reached one end of his round and was turning towards us. He had to have heard something, for there was a frown on his face when he surveyed the walkway. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-199.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
