By Mr. Nugent\u0027s advice he put up at the Palmer House, and devoted a part of his time to looking about the city. He was very much impressed by the bustling activity and energy of the Chicago people. He felt that life there and in New York was very different from the hum-drum existence of Portville. Yet there was no lack of attachment for his native village; and when, on the second day, the clerk handed him a letter with the familiar postmark, he opened it eagerly. The letter, as he surmised, was from Richard Childs, to whom alone he had said anything of his destination.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was the letter:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dear Gerald—It seems odd for me to sit down to write you a letter in Chicago. I cannot realize that you are so far away. What a lot you must have seen already! I only wish I were with you, instead of standing behind the counter in Mr. Tubbs\u0027 grocery store.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will ask how I like it. Well, I don\u0027t like it. It is hard work and long hours, and I don\u0027t find much interest in selling butter, sugar and other groceries over the counter. Still, we have had a share of excitement. You will be surprised to hear that your old friend Brandon has been discharged, and a new clerk hired from Dana. You remember the trouble you had, and the charge of stealing which was brought against you. I believe that up to the time of your going away Mr. Tubbs still believed you to be a thief. You can\u0027t wonder at it so much, for Brandon was constantly talking against you. But you were not without friends. Mr. Barton, from the savings bank, had an interview with Mr. Tubbs, and persuaded him to lay a trap for Brandon. Two marked bills—fives—were placed in the drawer, and presently one disappeared. I don\u0027t know whether Tubbs thought that I had taken it or not, but a day or two later Mr. Sullivan, who keeps the livery-stable, handed one in payment of his grocery bill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Where did you get this five-dollar note?\u0027 asked Tubbs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Why, isn\u0027t it good?\u0027 asked Sullivan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Yes; but I have a reason for asking. I hope you haven\u0027t forgotten who gave it to you?\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027No; I don\u0027t have so many fives handed in that I can\u0027t remember. That bill was given me by your clerk Brandon. He hired a team to go to Sherborn last Sunday and paid me with this bill.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027You could swear to that?\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Yes; certainly.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course this was convincing, and Brandon was summoned. When confronted with the charge he turned pale, and tried to brazen it out, saying that Sullivan was mistaken. But the livery man persisted in his assertion, saying that he noticed a cross in red ink on the bill when he took it. Upon that Brandon was discharged, and I understand his father has agreed to pay Mr. Tubbs fifty dollars to save him from arrest and prosecution. His successor, Mr. Toner, is a great improvement on him, and is much more satisfactory to me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I see your dear stepbrother Abel now and then. He asked me if I had heard from you, knowing our intimacy; but I answered \u0027No.\u0027 He was wondering whether you were still in New York. I could have told him, but I didn\u0027t. He isn\u0027t very popular in the village. He tries to boss the other boys, but doesn\u0027t succeed very well. The boys are getting up a baseball club. He wanted to be captain, but only received one vote—his own. The captain chosen is my honorable self. What do you think of Captain Childs? Sounds great, doesn\u0027t it? Write as soon as you can, and let me know what has happened to you.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your true friend,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Richard Childs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82360.html","bookId":325,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:46:27 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:46:27 AM"}
