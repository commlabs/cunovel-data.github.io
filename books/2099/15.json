How could she have let it happen? Before she even kicked off the covers and got out of bed she tried calling Adam. She had to set things right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered right away but sounded distracted. Or was he annoyed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a bad time?\" Cassie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" Adam said abruptly. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping we could talk,\" Cassie said. \"Will you meet me out on the bluff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s kind of important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam nervously cleared his throat. \"I wish I could, but I have to study for a history test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so obviously lying that it was almost insulting. \"Since when are you so concerned about studying?\" Cassie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? Since always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie knew something was wrong. Adam\u0027s voice sounded agitated and higher-pitched than usual. He was hiding something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to you now then, for a few minutes?\" Cassie asked. \"There\u0027s something I\u0027d like to say and I don\u0027t want to put it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, now really isn\u0027t such a good time. I\u0027m kind of in the middle of something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie could hardly believe her ears. Adam must be angry with her or he would never behave this way. But it didn\u0027t make sense. Just last night he had told her he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really do want to talk,\" Adam said. \"But it\u0027ll have to wait. I\u0027m sorry, Cassie, but I\u0027ve got to go. I\u0027ll call you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie said good-bye and then listened to the silence on Adam\u0027s end of the line for a few seconds after he hung up. The rift between them must be bigger than she had thought. And Adam didn\u0027t even know the worst of it yet. If he was this upset with her now, what would his reaction be when he found out she had kissed Nick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours passed, and Cassie still couldn\u0027t get the phone call with Adam out of her head. It wasn\u0027t only the fact that he had lied that was upsetting her. It was that she deserved it. He was right to not even want to hear her pathetic apology. If she were him, she wouldn\u0027t want to talk to her either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was someone else Cassie should apologize to, and she hoped he would at least hear her out. She filled up a few plates with some chicken and vegetables and brought them downstairs, just as an excuse to seek out Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she stepped inside the secret room, Nick was hunkered on the couch watching a bad horror movie with Deborah and Suzan. They were munching on popcorn and laughing. None of them turned to look at her, but the moment Cassie laid eyes on Nick she was overcome with shame. She couldn\u0027t even bear the sight of him. She set the food she\u0027d brought on the kitchen table and turned to run back upstairs as fast as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick noticed her and bolted up to catch her by the arm. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie glanced at Faye and Laurel, but neither of them noticed the commotion. They were both at their computers wearing headphones. And Deborah and Suzan were too engrossed in the blood and guts of their movie to care about what Nick and Cassie had going on. They turned up the volume on the TV to drown their voices out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick pulled Cassie aside. \"You\u0027re avoiding me. There\u0027s no reason for that. If we have to talk about it, we should talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s mind began swimming too fast to complete a coherent sentence. \"I don\u0027t know what happened last night,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry, I haven\u0027t been myself lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy,\" Nick said. \"Nothing catastrophic happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick, I kissed you. I practically jumped your bones. Adam would think it was pretty catastrophic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick smirked. \"True. But I kind of understand why it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I understood. I\u0027ve been working so hard to get you to be my friend again, and then I go and ...\" Cassie couldn\u0027t finish the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, it was just a fleeting moment,\" Nick said dismissively. \"I\u0027ve had a million moments where I wanted to do something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have?\" Cassie took a deep breath. \"I don\u0027t want this to mean - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t mean we should be anything more again,\" Nick said. \"Or that you should jeopardize what you have with Adam. I get that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cool reaction from Nick didn\u0027t exactly match their heated exchange yesterday, but Cassie would take what she could get. \"You forgive me then,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick shook his head. \"Stuff happens sometimes, Cassie. Especially between good friends. Wires get crossed; things get confused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s what we are?\" Cassie asked. \"Good friends? Still?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick avoided the question by glancing at the movie he was missing. \"Although it was a pretty hot kiss, if I do say so myself.\" He smiled, and Cassie tried to ignore the slightly condescending note in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact was, she was lucky enough to have not one but two guys in her life who really cared about her. If only she felt worthy of either of them right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought back to her tense conversation with Adam. If they were drifting apart, she wasn\u0027t going to let their relationship end without a fight. Refusing to let Scarlett, or Nick, or anyone get between them was the only way to prove to Adam that she loved him - and proving it was more important now than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad we\u0027ve cleared the air,\" Cassie said. \"Now I should probably go do damage control with my boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that means you\u0027re going to tell him,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to. I know it won\u0027t help your friendship, but I can\u0027t keep it from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should remind him that this room is spelled for protection. So he\u0027ll have to drag me out of it if he wants to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hope it won\u0027t come to that. Besides, I think this time I\u0027ll be the one taking the blame.\" Cassie gave Nick a peck on the cheek. \"Wish me luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need luck,\" Nick said. \"Adam\u0027s not going to let you go that easily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie ran back upstairs and out of the house, sprinting down the sun-drenched block while practicing her apology to Adam in her head. She found herself at the wooden threshold of his front door within minutes. Adam\u0027s Mustang, she noticed, was absent from the driveway, but he often parked it inside the garage, so that didn\u0027t mean much. First Cassie knocked on the heavy oak door, and then she rang the bell. But all she could hear on the other side was Raj\u0027s incessant barking. Adam wasn\u0027t home. Nobody was, it seemed. But ever since their conversation that morning, Cassie had known something was off. She suddenly imagined Adam hiding inside, waiting for her to give up and leave him alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he really pretend to not be home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked to her left and right; there was no one in sight except for a blue uniformed mailman wearing giant headphones and bobbing to music only he could hear. Cassie hastily used a spell to unlock the door. It unlatched with a click, and she squeaked it open. Inside Raj was jumping and barking anxiously, as if he knew something was wrong. She gave the dog a pat to quiet him and scanned the shadowy living room and den.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere could Adam be? Wherever he was, he clearly didn\u0027t want her to know, or he wouldn\u0027t have sounded so strange on the phone earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie crept into Adam\u0027s bedroom to have a quick look around. His bed was an unmade mountain of blankets, and his history books were lying unopened on his nightstand. He obviously wasn\u0027t studying for a history test. At least now she had proof he\u0027d been lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe searched his desk for some clue as to where he might have gone, or what he was up to. As she shifted a few papers to the side, her finger accidentally brushed against the mouse to his computer and the monitor came to life. A gray image of an old house filled the screen. It was the Stockbridge Mission House, Cassie was sure of it. It was the very same house that had appeared during the locator spell. And below its ghostly image were step-by-step driving directions to get there from New Salem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t, Cassie thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as she clicked through the information on Adam\u0027s computer, it became more and more clear that he had. It was the only logical explanation, and it suddenly all made sense - his lies and anxious tone on the phone, and how at their meeting he\u0027d reluctantly agreed to do more research when only a moment before he\u0027d been itching to go after Scarlett immediately. Do-or-die time, he\u0027d called it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam had gone after Scarlett. Alone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-15.html","bookId":2099,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM"}
