He was Foreign Secretary in the mayor\u0027s cabinet,and to\u0026nbsp; all the outer suns, barring only the\u0026nbsp; Foundation itself, he was, inaddition, Primate\u0026nbsp; of the Church, Purveyor of the\u0026nbsp; Holy Food, Master of theTemples,\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; so\u0026nbsp; forth\u0026nbsp; almost\u0026nbsp; indefinitely in\u0026nbsp; confusing\u0026nbsp; but\u0026nbsp; sonoroussyllables.\n\u003cbr\u003e He was\u0026nbsp; saying, \"But\u0026nbsp; he agreed to\u0026nbsp; let you send\u0026nbsp; out that trader.\u0026nbsp; It is apoint.\"\"But such\u0026nbsp; a small\u0026nbsp; one,\" said Sutt.\u0026nbsp; \"It gets us\u0026nbsp; nothing immediately. Thewhole business\u0026nbsp; is the crudest sort\u0026nbsp; of stratagem, since we\u0026nbsp; have no way offoreseeing it\u0026nbsp; to the end.\u0026nbsp; It is a mere\u0026nbsp; paying out of rope\u0026nbsp; on the chancethat somewhere along the length of it will be a noose.\"\"True. And this Mallow\u0026nbsp; is a capable man. What if he is not an easy prey todupery?\"\"That\u0026nbsp; is a\u0026nbsp; chance that\u0026nbsp; must be\u0026nbsp; run. If\u0026nbsp; there is\u0026nbsp; treachery, it\u0026nbsp; is thecapable men\u0026nbsp; that are implicated. If\u0026nbsp; not, we need a\u0026nbsp; capable man to detectthe\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; truth.\u0026nbsp; And\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Mallow\u0026nbsp; will\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; be\u0026nbsp; guarded.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Your\u0026nbsp; glass\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; is\u0026nbsp; empty.\"\"No, thanks. I\u0027ve had enough.\"Sutt filled his own glass and patiently endured the other\u0027s uneasy reverie.\n\u003cbr\u003e Of whatever\u0026nbsp; the reverie consisted, it\u0026nbsp; ended indecisively, for the primatesaid\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; suddenly,\u0026nbsp; almost\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; explosively,\u0026nbsp; \"Sutt,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; what\u0027s\u0026nbsp; on\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; your\u0026nbsp; mind?\"\"I\u0027ll tell\u0026nbsp; you, Manlio.\" His thin\u0026nbsp; lips parted, \"We\u0027re in\u0026nbsp; the middle of aSeldon crisis.\"Manlio stared,\u0026nbsp; then said softly, \"How do you\u0026nbsp; know? Has Seldon appeared inthe Time Vault again?\"\"That much,\u0026nbsp; my friend,\u0026nbsp; is not necessary.\u0026nbsp; Look, reason it\u0026nbsp; out. Since theGalactic Empire\u0026nbsp; abandoned the Periphery, and threw us\u0026nbsp; on our own, we havenever had an opponent who possessed nuclear power. Now, for the first time,we\u0026nbsp; have one. That\u0026nbsp; seems significant even\u0026nbsp; if it\u0026nbsp; stood by itself.\u0026nbsp; And itdoesn\u0027t. For\u0026nbsp; the first time in\u0026nbsp; over seventy years, we\u0026nbsp; are facing a majordomestic political\u0026nbsp; crisis. I\u0026nbsp; should think the synchronization\u0026nbsp; of the twocrises, inner and outer, puts it beyond all doubt.\"Manlio\u0027s eyes\u0026nbsp; narrowed, \"If that\u0027s\u0026nbsp; all, it\u0027s not enough.\u0026nbsp; There have beentwo Seldon\u0026nbsp; crises so far, and\u0026nbsp; both times the Foundation\u0026nbsp; was in danger ofextermination.\u0026nbsp; Nothing can be\u0026nbsp; a third\u0026nbsp; crisis till that\u0026nbsp; danger returns.\"Sutt never\u0026nbsp; showed impatience, \"That danger is coming.\u0026nbsp; Any fool can tell acrisis when\u0026nbsp; it arrives. The real\u0026nbsp; service to the state\u0026nbsp; is to detect it inembryo. Look,\u0026nbsp; Manlio, we\u0027re\u0026nbsp; proceeding along a\u0026nbsp; planned history. We\u0026nbsp; knowthat Hari Seldon worked\u0026nbsp; out the historical probabilities of the future. Weknow\u0026nbsp; that some day we\u0027re\u0026nbsp; to rebuild the Galactic Empire. We\u0026nbsp; know that itwill take a thousand years or thereabouts.

These traders?\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah!\" The primate stiffened, and his eyes grew sharp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s right.\u0026nbsp; These traders. They are\u0026nbsp; useful, but they are\u0026nbsp; too strong ?\n\u003cbr\u003e and too uncontrolled. They are Outlanders, educated apart from religion. Onthe\u0026nbsp; one hand,\u0026nbsp; we put\u0026nbsp; knowledge into\u0026nbsp; their hands,\u0026nbsp; and on the\u0026nbsp; other, weremove our strongest hold upon them.\"\"If we can prove treachery?\"\"If\u0026nbsp; we could,\u0026nbsp; direct\u0026nbsp; action would\u0026nbsp; be\u0026nbsp; simple and\u0026nbsp; sufficient. But\u0026nbsp; thatdoesn\u0027t signify\u0026nbsp; in the\u0026nbsp; least. Even if\u0026nbsp; treason among them\u0026nbsp; did not exist,they would form an uncertain element in our society. They wouldn\u0027t be boundto\u0026nbsp; us by\u0026nbsp; patriotism or common\u0026nbsp; descent, or\u0026nbsp; even by religious\u0026nbsp; awe. Undertheir secular leadership, the\u0026nbsp; outer provinces, which, since Hardin\u0027s time,look to us as the Holy Planet, might break away.\"\"I see all that, but the cure?\n\u003cbr\u003e \"The cure\u0026nbsp; must come\u0026nbsp; quickly, before the\u0026nbsp; Seldon Crisis becomes\u0026nbsp; acute.
