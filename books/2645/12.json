With his other hand, he snatched up her gown so he could watch her body twisting with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a breathy cry that made his cock jerk painfully in answer, and her knees fell wide open. In utter abandon, she rocked her hips against his hand, over and over, until the tension left her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, she fell back onto the arm he\u0027d draped behind her, lying docile and open as he slowly continued to pet her flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t catch his breath. The sight of his fingertips against the wet auburn curls at her sex...He was going to lose his seed right in his trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned up to bury her face against his neck. To his disbelief, she whispered how much she loved his touch.His touch. After a decade fantasizing about it, he\u0027d made her come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was the most incredible experience he\u0027d ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breaths were warm and quick, and between her words, she gave his neck little licks that made his cock grow impossibly hotter and harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, spending in his pants did not strike him as a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inwardly shook himself and pulled away, but she\u0027d looped her soft arms around his neck and eased a knee up beside his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh, what about you? Won\u0027t you stay with me?\" She tugged gently, until he allowed himself to settle his hips between her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted him to come as well? Could he drag himself away? Not when she undulated her bared sex against him. Impossible. He was burning to free himself and sink into her slick heat, desperate to ride her mindlessly, finally taking what he\u0027d needed for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, when she did that sensual roll of her hips again, he tentatively thrust back against her. She sucked in a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinna hurt you?\" he choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she said, \"No, darling, no,\" he leaned up and found his hand shooting between them to rip open the fastening of his trousers. He shoved his pants down to his thighs, baring his cock, so that it hung down over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both breathing heavily, staring at where their bodies almost touched. Their flesh was so close. Her eyes were half-lidded as she stared at his shaft, at the slick head. As if in a dream, he watched as she rolled her hips again, seeking him. He put his straightened arms on each side of her, holding himself up, sweating with the effort not to take her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he couldn\u0027t have her, even when it felt so right to be here with her like this. He was awash in how right it felt. Yet, unable to stop himself, he pressed his own hips down. Lower, so slowly, until his shaft grazed against her swollen little clitoris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes rolled back in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a cry and another undulation that nearly put his cockhead inside her, ending everything. One of his hands shot to her hip to pin her down, then he pressed his shaft harder against her mound. He stayed there, letting it throb against her. Where his control came from, he had no idea. He only knew he had to stretch out every second, to make it last the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she reached eager hands forward to grasp him, he grabbed her wrists, knowing he\u0027d come before her last finger had wrapped around his shaft. \"Put your arms over your head, S¨¬ne.\" She let them fall above her. \"Keep them there for me.\" She nodded, as if she understood his struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon the urge to thrust grew overwhelming. He obeyed it, pushing slowly over her sex, slipping up to her flat belly, then back, a near-constant groan rising from his chest. With his position and the movement, he was close to being inside her, as close as he would ever allow himself to get. Her cries would be the same - as would the way she was gazing up at him when she spread her legs wider and whispered, \"Oh, God! Yes, Hugh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe savored even this agonizing pressure. Another slow push over her sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane,\" he groaned. Each time his shaft slid over her, he could feel his sack tightening until it ground against her wetness too. She made some unintelligible sound at the contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pleasure was too great. He was going to come, and he was going to come hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his head and rasped, \"Arch your back for me. Have tae taste you again.\" When she rushed to do so, he sucked her nipple between his lips, then tugged it with his teeth until she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she telling him she was about to come again? He\u0027d make her. He\u0027d hold on until she did once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure had nearly turned to pain when she cried out his name and thrashed beneath him in her orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost, he ground himself determinedly up and back against her. \"Ah, God, S¨¬ne, I have tae...come,\" he groaned, beginning to ejaculate. He gave a brutal yell each time the hard spurts lashed across her belly...over and over until he\u0027d finally emptied his seed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body wracked with after-shudders, he sank onto his elbows with hoarse exhalations of breath against her damp neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d been thrusting over her like that. He closed his eyes in shame - he\u0027d spilled his seed on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing away, he tucked his sensitive shaft back into his pants, then rose to grab a towel. When he returned he couldn\u0027t bear to look at her, even as he wiped her skin and pulled her gown into place. He tossed the towel away and sat on the edge of the bed, head in his hands. Never had he felt so ashamed, so low. How was he going to face her tomorrow? Didn\u0027t matter, he\u0027d have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how badly he needed to leave, they couldn\u0027t be separated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane, I doona know what happened. I\u0027m sorry.\" He should be humiliated to be near her, and yet it was she he wanted to be with in the face of his shame - so that he didn\u0027t have to take it alone. It was enough to drive any man mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to apologize for.\" She sat up on her knees behind him. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I should have had more control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh,\" she murmured, rubbing his back, \"it\u0027s just me, remember? It\u0027s just your Jane. We were always comfortable around each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This should no\u0027 have happened,\" he insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when he\u0027d decided to rise, she said, \"Stay. Sleep with me, please.\" She coaxed with light touches and soft words until he somehow found himself out of his pants and in bed with her. When he\u0027d resigned himself to staying like this, he drew her back to his chest, his arms smoothly crossing over her as if he\u0027d locked her against him thousands of times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he\u0027d imagined that last summer again and again, she was finally naked in his bed. He\u0027d stared at this very ceiling and fantasized about touching her, kissing her. He\u0027d dreamed of holding her as she slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality was so much more. He\u0027d known he would love the scent of her hair. He hadn\u0027t known he would want to groan and shove a handful to his face. Or that he would realize her hair was long enough to brush his legs if she threw her head back while she rode him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d known he would love the feel of her, but he hadn\u0027t realized how round her arse would be or that it fit like a puzzle piece to his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more nightmares, Hugh,\" she whispered drowsily. \"Or we\u0027ll have to do that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already wanted to dothat again, was even now growing hard against her bottom. When she sighed in contentment, he frowned as he tried to recall how he\u0027d ever thought living with her was bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she woke the next morning, Hugh was sleeping soundly. She lay staring, fascinated with the man before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his jaw unclenched, his face looked changed, younger even. The gashes on his cheek were healing, giving him a roguish look. That made her smile. Hewas a rogue - a mercenary - but he wasn\u0027t arake .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe skimmed the pad of her forefinger over his bottom lip, remembering how he\u0027d kissed her last night - deeply, desperately, like it was the last kiss he\u0027d ever take from her, and he had to make it last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in her had responded, and she\u0027d let herself go. She shivered just recalling how he\u0027d rocked his massive body over her, sliding his shaft against her sex until he\u0027d brought her twice to orgasm. And then to see him take his pleasure as well, to see him spending over her flesh...wondrous. Though judging by his discomfited reaction last night, she doubted she\u0027d ever be seeing it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was a problem, as she\u0027d all but decided Hugh MacCarrick had to be her first lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027d ever needed her cousins\u0027 advice, it was now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday. Surely, today they would arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she tenderly brushed a lock of black hair from his forehead, his gorgeous dark eyes eased open. Seeming still half-asleep, he reached his hand up to stroke her cheek. When she smiled, his brows drew together in puzzlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he shot away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter stabbing his legs into his pants, he paced for long moments, the muscles in his upper body growing more and more tensed. \"This should no\u0027 have happened, and it canna happen again,\" he finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone implied that they were discussing a tragedy, something akin to a death in the family - not the most mind-boggling pleasure she\u0027d ever imagined. She couldn\u0027t help but feel insulted, and sat up, drawing the sheet up to her chest. \"Honestly, Hugh, you\u0027re making a mountain out of a molehill.\" She waved her hand dismissively. \"We...trifled a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of being grateful as she\u0027d expected - after all, she could have called him a cad and pressed to stay married - he appeared furious. \"If we\u0027d \u0027trifled\u0027 an inch lower, there could be dire consequences. Have you forgotten that we both agreed no\u0027 to do this? We agreed at the outset. Do you want to get stuck in this marriage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you would stop living in terror that you might get trapped in marriage with me. We didn\u0027t make love. Now, it\u0027s very simple. We put this behind us and never speak of it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never met a woman who could skewer a man\u0027s sense of self-worth like you can. Whoever marries you in truth will need to be a better man than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared up at him. Skewering had never been her intention, but at that moment, she didn\u0027t regret the outcome. \"You are making too much of this,\" she insisted. \"Why are you so angry when nothing permanent occurred? You\u0027re acting like a provincial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you can easily put it behind you, but thattrifling affected me.\" Suddenly his eyes narrowed as he lunged forward to grab her elbow. \"You\u0027re no\u0027 a virgin, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew back her head in bewilderment. \"Why would you askthat question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, Hugh. Don\u0027t be like this.For ten years, he\u0027d been out sowing his wild oats; yet he probably expected her to have been waiting for a husband. Of course, shewas a virgin, but, as was often the case, right now she wished she weren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a narrow-minded expectation was galling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone cold as ice, she said, \"Darling, I\u0027ve been as celibate asyou have been since we last saw each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her, but kept his hands raised as he backed away, as if he couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d touched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you care if I bedded a dozen men?\" she asked in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raked his fingers through his hair. \"Because women like you doona get \u0027easy annulments.\u0027 No\u0027 based on lack of consummation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit the wall, making her jump, then turned to her with the air of some trapped beast who knew the end was near. He was that averse to having her as his wife?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How in the hell did you plan to end the marriage?\" he demanded. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure my father can manage something - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will no\u0027 bloody stop me, Jane. I dinna sign on for more. If our annulment does no\u0027 go as planned, I will still leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart went cold. Memories of loneliness and hopelessness washed over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d left her before without a warning. He would again, this time after telling her to her face that nothing would cleave him to her - even as she sat naked in a bed still warmed from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo longer would she open herself up to him. She couldn\u0027t.Self-preservation, Janey. Hugh MacCarrick was the only man who could ever make her cry. False smile in place, she said with all honesty, \"Of course you will leave me, darling. I never expected anything else from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot her another disillusioned look, then strode away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his behavior the night before, this morning had already been grueling enough. But now to learn that Jane had definitely had at least one man was punishing for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d suspected she and Bidworth had been lovers, but toknow ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of Bidworth, or another man like him, taking her innocence made Hugh\u0027s stomach clench, made him want to roar with fury. He felt this even as he knew he had no right to, no right to hate the fact that she\u0027d welcomed another - or others - into her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d said those things to Jane out of jealousy and because he\u0027d been furious with himself - for one foggy moment when he first awakened, he\u0027d been about to start the madness again. Even now, he found himself wishing he\u0027d just gone ahead and taken her last night, or even this morning, when she\u0027d looked so tousled and well-loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d taken his frustrations out on her, sounding like some inflexible old-guard Tory, and she hadn\u0027t deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane was unique and independent, and she couldn\u0027t be judged by others\u0027 standards. She was twenty-seven and had a very healthy sexual appetite. Even as he understood this, the idea of her appeasing her needs with others maddened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was obsessed with her. He wanted her to lavish that desire on him, wanted her all to himself. The idea of Bidworth trying to handle all her passion was laughable. After last night, Hugh knew that he was the man for it - even as he knew he could never allow himself to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d given her a few hours to get over her pique, but now they needed to talk about what the hell they were going to do about their annulment. Hugh loped to her room, but found no sign of her. He made his way to the upstairs parlor. After dressing this morning, she\u0027d sat in the window seat there for hours, gazing out at Vinelands as she had for the last two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and his brothers used to do the same constantly. They\u0027d first traveled down to this property at the suggestion of concerned relatives in the clan. Ethan had just received the injury to his face and would be able to heal in a more private setting; Court would have no one to fight....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d been there only a week before the Weylands had descended on the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the lofty vantage of Ros Creag, the three brothers had sat and watched the goings-on at Vinelands. Always a huge fire burned outside, peopledanced in the yard, and singing and raucous laughter carried across the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh, Ethan, and Court had gawked in confusion. Their existence had been dour, their home in the north of Scotland dark ever since the death of their father. They\u0027d rarely spoken to their mother, Fiona, who couldn\u0027t recover from the loss of her beloved husband Leith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day he\u0027d died, Fiona had pulled at her hair, screaming at her sons, \"I told you no\u0027 to read it! How many times did I tell you? It always wins!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh shook himself, preparing to face Jane as he entered the parlor - the empty parlor. She wasn\u0027t in the window seat. Excellent, she was avoiding him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr would she have tried to leave, after his callous words this morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of unease settled over him. He bellowed her name. Nothing. Just as he was about to go tearing through the house, some movement outside caught his attention. He glanced out the window, saw bairns piling out onto the front lawn at Vinelands, with some harried woman running after them. Adults alighted from carriages. Weylands were here?Now? Brows drawn, he strode forward to peer out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd spotted a glimpse of Jane\u0027s green riding skirt on the shore path to Vinelands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bounded down the stairs, then outside onto the terrace, disbelieving his eyes. As though she sensed him, she turned back, gave him a sarcastic salute, then turned away dismissively. Sprinting for the stable, he vowed he\u0027d tie her arse to a chair before she did this again. He looped a bit on his horse, not taking time for a saddle, before charging hell-bent along the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he neared, Jane began racing for Vinelands as if for a friendly country\u0027s border. But Hugh dropped from his horse to the ground and snared her around the waist in one fluid movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinging her around to face him, he snapped, \"Never, never leave like that again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or what?\" she asked, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutched her slim shoulders. \"Or I\u0027ll tie your arse to a bed.\" When hadchair becomebed ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely, you brute - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brute? This brute\u0027s tryin\u0027 to protect you, yet you treat all this like it\u0027s a game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I not when you tell me nothing? You\u0027ve given me nothing truly tangible to worry about! You and Father both said Grey isn\u0027t in England, so how could he have followed us here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why take that risk?\" Hugh said, loosening his hold on her shoulders. \"Why\u0027re there Weylands here now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They like the quiet season.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew they were coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Hugh, I need to go there. It\u0027s important to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you no\u0027 just ask me to take you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"I knew you wouldn\u0027t let me. But I\u0027m asking you now to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo with her? To the other side?No\u0027 bloody likely. \"I canna keep an eye on you among all of them.\" He was so unused to being around groups of people, it made him constantly wary. Much less aroundthese people. \"And how would you explain us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d tell them the truth.\" Her chin went up. \"We\u0027re married. That\u0027s all I\u0027d say, for right now. In the future, I\u0027ll explain what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many people,\" he insisted. He had no wish for Jane to know how utterly inept he was in social situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my family. They\u0027ll never say a word. You\u0027ve never seen such a loyal family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jane, you\u0027ve got to understand that your life is on the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look me in the eyes and tell me that a day at Vinelands will put my life in more danger than staying at Ros Creag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh opened his mouth to speak, then closed it directly. If Grey had somehow made it past the net into England, then he would have Ethan breathing down his neck long before he ever thought to approach Ros Creag. And if he somehow got past Ethan, Grey would have to traverse the lake by ferry, which could be seen from Vinelands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically, Hugh deemed it safe enough. But the last social event he had attended as a participant, not just skulking in the shadows, had been the festivities the night before Ethan\u0027s ill-fated wedding, and Hugh had never seen any of those guests again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis next attempt was to be a day at Vinelands? A trial by fire? Damn it, he\u0027d avoided this all those times in the past - yet now she expected him to voluntarily walk among the mad, carefree Weylands. He\u0027d be more comfortable walking into a hail of bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd God help him if Jane told her cousins about his behavior the night before. He shuddered at the possibility. A trial by inferno. \"Does no\u0027 matter. I\u0027ve told you we\u0027re returning. So that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip and gazed up at him with those big, green eyes. When he realized she was about to ask in a way he hadn\u0027t yet figured out how to deny, he cut her off, snapping, \"No\u0027 a chance,\" and dragged her toward the horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was biting out Gaelic curses, she slapping at his grip on her elbow and kicking at his shins, when a voice cried, \"Jane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both faced forward and froze. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-12.html","bookId":2645,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 PM"}
