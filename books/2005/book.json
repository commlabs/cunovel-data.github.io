They\u0027d been best friends ever since he pushed her down on the playground and she made him eat a mud pie. Somewhere over the years, she fell for him and fell hard. The big problem with that? Kyler puts the \u0027man\u0027 in man-whore. He\u0027s never stayed with a girl longer than a few nights, and with it being their last year in college, Syd doesn\u0027t want to risk their friendship by declaring her love. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eKyler has always put Syd on a pedestal that was too high for him to reach. To him, she\u0027s perfect and she\u0027s everything. But the feelings he has for her, he\u0027s always hidden away or focused on any other female. After all, Kyler will always be the poor boy from the wrong side of tracks, and Syd will always be the one girl he can never have. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut when they\u0027re stranded together at a posh ski resort due to a massive Nor\u0027easter, there\u0027s nothing stopping their red-hot feelings for each other from coming to the surface. Can their friendship survive the attraction? Better yet, can they survive at all? Because as the snow falls, someone is stalking them, and this ski trip may be a life-changer in more ways than one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/frigid-frigid-1.jpg","author":"Jennifer L.
