The sun was warm on his face as he rode west along Itko Kan’s coastal track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his wake, in the lengthening shadows, two figures took form. Moments later huge hounds appeared. One bent to sniff at the turnips, and then turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure with the cane sighed. ‘Satisfied?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other one nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you imagine only the best now, don’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see no reason why not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone snorted. ‘You wouldn’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCotillion glanced over at him. ‘Why not, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Old friend, what is this? Do you still hold to a belief in hope?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do I believe in hope? I do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And faith?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And faith. Yes. I believe in faith.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither spoke for a time, and then Shadowthrone looked over at the Hounds, and cocked his head. ‘Hungry, are we?’ Bestial heads lifted, eyes fixing on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t even think it, Ammeanas!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not? Remind that fop on the throne who’s really running this game!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not yet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where is your impatience? Your desire for vengeance? What sort of Patron of Assassins are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCotillion nodded down the road. ‘Leave them alone. Not here, not now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone sighed a second time. ‘Misery guts.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadows dissolved, and a moment later were gone, leaving nothing but an empty road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun set, dusk closing in. He’d yet to pass any traffic on this day and that was a little troubling, but he rode on. Having never been this way before, he almost missed the side track leading down to the settlement on the shelf of land above a crescent beach, but he caught the smell of woodsmoke in time to slow up his mount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast carefully picked its way down the narrow path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the bottom, now in darkness, he reined in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore him was a small fishing village, though it looked mostly abandoned. He saw a cottage nearby, stone-walled and thatch-roofed, with a stone chimney from which smoke drifted in a thin grey stream. An area of land had been cleared above and behind it where vegetables had been planted, and working still in the growing gloom was a lone figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrokus dismounted, hobbled the horse outside an abandoned shack to his left, and made his way forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should not have taken long, yet by the time he reached the verge of the garden the moon overhead was bright, its effervescent light glistening along her limbs, the sheen of her black hair like silk as she bent to gather up her tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped between rows of bushy plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she turned. Watched him walk up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrokus took her face in his hands, studied her dark eyes. ‘I never liked that story,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Which one?’ she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The lover … lost on the moon, tending her garden alone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s not quite like that, the story I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. ‘It’s what I remember from it. That, and the look in your eyes when you told it to me. I was reminded of that look a moment ago.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think,’ he said, ‘the sadness just went away, Apsalar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think,’ she replied, ‘you are right.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy watched the old man come down to the pier as he did almost every day whenever the boy happened to be lingering along the waterfront at around this time, when the morning was stretching towards noon and all the fish were asleep. Day after day, he’d seen the old man carrying that silly bucket with the rope tied to the handle for the fish he never caught – and the fishing rod in his other hand would most likely snap in half at a crab’s tug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBored, as he was every day, the boy ambled down to stand on the edge of the pier, to look out on the few ships that bothered sheltering in the harbour of Malaz City. So he could dream of the worlds beyond, where things exciting and magical happened and heroes won the day and villains bled out in the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was nobody yet. Not old enough for anything. Trapped here where nothing ever happened and never would. But one day he would face the whole world and, why, they’d all know his face, they would. He glanced over to where the old man was sitting down, legs over the edge, working bait on to the hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You won’t never catch nothing,’ the boy said, idly pulling at a rusty mooring ring. ‘You sleep in too late, every day.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-471.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
