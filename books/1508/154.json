His palm struck down, and a merciless handprint appeared on Zhang Guanyu’s back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘Pulse Cutting Palm’!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s true essence infiltrated into Zhang Guanyu’s body. At this time, Zhang Guanyu had already completely lost any means of resistance, so the true essence rapidly spread out, unobstructed, across all of Zhang Guanyu’s meridians. His meridians were smashed apart by the rushing true essence, including many key points, pores, and all else; everything was utterly ravaged!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhang Guanyu stiffly groaned, and fainted!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sudden change in events caused everyone to gasp. Lin Ming had ignored Ouyang Dihua’s command, and moreover he had abruptly broken through Ouyang Dihua’s interference to strike a palm upon Zhang Guanyu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDid this not mean that Lin Ming’s speed was quicker than Ouyang Dihua’s?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ouyang Dihua actually could not stop Lin Ming! Lin Ming is too terrifying!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ouyang Dihua is the direct disciple of an elder, he’s definitely not some ordinary Pulse Condensation Period martial artist, and Lin Ming is only at the Altering Muscle stage…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese people discussed in a low voice with each other through true essence sound transmission. The looks upon their faces as they gazed at Lin Ming were filled with reverence, and even fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter he used a single palm to cut off the root of so many future troubles, Lin Ming deliberately picked up the Thunderbolt Devilfire Bead that was by Zhang Guanyu. Although it was the first time that he had seen something like this, Lin Ming could approximately guess what it did. It must be some kind of destructive concealed weapon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he examined the Thunderbolt Devilfire Bead, Lin Ming could feel a tingling sensation akin to arrows piercing his back. He calmly turned around to see Ouyang Dihua balefully gazing at him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang had never been as angry as he was today. He was already mad enough that Lin Ming had ignored his order, but what he could not accept the most, was that his attack in which he had invested his full strength to stop Lin Ming, had actually been evaded by him, and thus failed. This caused him to lose a great amount of face!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe was a martial artist at the Pulse Condensation Period. He was 24 years old, and was also a direct disciple of a Seven Profound Valleys elder. Lin Ming was only a quasi-core disciple, 15 years old, and his cultivation was at the early Altering Muscle stage. He had actually been beaten by Lin Ming, and his palm had struck nothing but empty air. He could only helplessly look on as this little brat struck Zhang Guanyu with a heavy hand. He was older than Lin Ming by 9 years; his life had just been all in vain!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow where had all his dignity gone?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis martial talent was not anything too outstanding. The reason he was able to become a direct disciple of an elder was because his uncle was the third elder of the Acacia Faction. What he hated the most was those that spoke behind his back and said, “This Ouyang Dihua only relied on his relations to become a core disciple. He has no skill at all.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Good! Very good! You did not listen to my orders and still maliciously attacked Zhang Guanyu when he had lost all ability to resist! Just by this alone, I can cripple you!” Ouyang Dihua clenched his fists, his eyes glazed over with hate as he wished he could just eat Lin Ming alive.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming did not have an change of expression. He flashed the Thunderbolt Devilfire Bead in his hand, and confidently said, “Sir Seven Profound Envoy, I think that you should recognize this. Zhang Guanyu wanted to use this against me. I don’t believe this is allowed in the rules of this duel. This is probably something that can only be refined by a large sect, its power can be imagined. How can you say he had lost the ability to resist?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is Sir Seven Profound Envoy’s meaning that I should hold out my neck and let him cut off my head? Should I have waited until Zhang Guanyu severely injured me before I dealt with him? I’m sorry; I’m simply not someone so noble. Also, there are many important people present. Since this thing’s power is so great, wouldn’t it be horrible if he threw this out and injured everybody?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It doesn’t take much true essence to throw this. As long as Zhang Guanyu has even a breath of life left in himself, he can readily throw this out. That’s why, I had to stop him. I only put him to sleep. The palm I used was a bit heavy a moment ago, but I made sure not to remove Sir Zhang’s hand. I’m sorry, I truly do feel regret, but I was helplessly forced to act.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Taking 10,000 steps back, I say that even if I was to be cruel, Sir Zhang and I have already signed a Life Death Contract before this, and we have even pressed our thumbs as proof, so that any life threatening wounds cannot be investigated. Mister Ouyang, don’t you remember?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s reasoning caused Ouyang Dihua to tremble with rage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat palm was not too heavy?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Ouyang Dihua did not understand what profound mysteries were contained within that palm strike, what he certainly knew was that with Lin Ming’s decisive and vicious movement, that palm absolutely had done some great harm to Zhang Guanyu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCoupled with the fact that before, he had already ruined Zhang Guanyu’s right hand, and turned it into nothing more than ravaged meat and broken bones. Without rare and valuable medicine that could regrow limbs, it would simply not heal well. It seemed that from here on out, Zhang Guanyu’s martial path had come to a full stop.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis Zhang Guanyu was a person whose heart was simply too proud. He could not tolerate even a small failure, much less a failure of this level!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePerhaps his heart of martial arts had been totally defeated, and he would never be able to recover!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhang Guanyu’s entire life could now be considered over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt just so happened that Lin Ming’s vicious move was actually not wrong nor against the rules. Just before, Zhang Guanyu had wanted to kill Lin Ming, and this Thunderbolt Devilfire Bead was the evidence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAccording to the regulations of the Seven Profound Martial House, one could not kill an opponent in battle or deliberately disable them when they had lost the ability to resist counterattacks, or else they would be subject to certain punishments.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now Lin Ming hadn’t actually killed his opponent, nor had he disabled his opponent once they had lost any means to resist. What he did was a legitimate defense, so there was simply no violation of any rules. This caused Ouyang Dihua to almost go crazy with vexation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot only that, but they had also signed the Life Death Contract before the duel, so Ouyang Dihua could not find fault with Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTherefore, he had no means to deal with Lin Ming. He was a 24 year old man while Lin Ming was only a 15 year old youth. If he relied on his cultivation to intimidate, it would be seen as an elder bullying the younger generation. If he had no appropriate reason to deal with Lin Ming, then any actions could not be justified.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, Ouyang Dihua thought back to Lin Ming’s elusive speed, and he began to lack self-confidence. If he was able to suppress Lin Ming with his absolute power, then that would be good. However, if he still could not defeat Lin Ming in several moves, then he would really want to hit his head on a wall and die. This nine year gap would simply be too laughable a matter!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut today, he could not forget this matter or let it go, or else his dignity would be gone!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe atmosphere was very solemn and grim. Anybody could see that the sparks between Lin Ming and Ouyang Dihua were about to burst. These two were a future Seven Profound Envoy and a current Seven Profound Envoy that were in opposition to each other!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, no matter how one looked at it, Lin Ming was the weaker party.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming is in danger… Ouyang Dihua is not someone to be trifled with. Even the Seven Profound Martial House Master has to treat him with a bit of respect.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The youth has courage. Now that Lin Ming has provoked Ouyang Dihua before he has grown, I’m afraid that Lin Ming will have dark days from here on out.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Don’t look down on Lin Ming. Just look at all the enemies Lin Ming has made; Zhang Cang, Zhu Yan, Zhang Guanyu… all have been defeated by Lin Ming. Zhang Cang and Zhu Yan are too weak, but leaving them aside, isn’t Zhang Guanyu at the peak, whether it is cultivation or individual strength?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe truth was that there was an enemy that no one dared to name out loud. This was the Tenth Prince, Yang Zhen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYang Zhen had been tightly and significantly suppressed by Lin Ming. He could only smile it front of Lin Ming, not caring about keeping any face. He only needed to look at those who cared about face, such as Zhang Cang, Zhu Yan, and Zhang Guanyu, to see that they were all finished. \u0026nbsp;The Tenth Prince Yang Zhen was wise, every day he could play ball with Lin Ming was an extra day.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany of those present shared a different view. Some worried over Lin Ming, and some, who liked to gloat over others’ misfortunes, looked forward to seeing Lin Ming be played to death by Ouyang Dihua.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was powerful, but, behind Ouyang Dihua was an elder of the Seven Profound Valleys. Such a character could easily send down a Seven Profound Decree that could even cause a nation to switch rulers, and change the name of the land. Even if Lin Ming reached the Pulse Condensation period, he would not dare to move against Ouyang Dihua, otherwise that would simply be courting death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn all the controversy, Bai Jingyun was silently biting her lips as she looked at Lin Ming with a very complex expression.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe still had half a year… the day on which her filial obligations to mourn the death of her father for three years would end, was in half a year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the mourning period had ended, that was the day Ouyang Dihua would propose marriage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBai Jingyun did not expect that her grandfather, who had to worry about the family interests, would have the courage to refuse this marriage.

Bai Jingyun had clearly seen Ouyang Dihua’s eyes when he looked at her, and those eyes were filled with greed and immorality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBai Jingyun had already resigned herself to her fate, but now, she saw that Lin Ming and Ouyang Dihua were enemies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis caused her heart to clench.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMaybe…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust maybe… there was a 1% possibility that Lin Ming could rescue her from the fiery pit…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the military field, Ouyang Dihua took one step at a time towards Lin Ming. Every time he took one step, his horrible aura would become one point stronger. His footsteps caused the hearts of those who looked to beat as if they were resonating with them. This feeling was very uncomfortable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Since I cannot move against you, then I will force you to submit!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Ouyang Dihua fiercely though this, the aura of his body suddenly erupted.

He was just missing one step before he could break through to the fourth layer. His imposing aura was much more perilous than Zhang Guanyu’s. With every step, all sorts of chaotic illusions and demons seemed to rush upwards like a swelling tide that covered Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThose standing around Ouyang Dihua were forced to retreat.

Even those martial artists at the Flesh Training and Viscera Training stages did not feel good, and were forced to revolve the true essence within their entire bodies to resist Ouyang Dihua’s oppressive presence. There were those whose cultivations were simply too weak, and, not giving any thought to face, simply ran away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Pulse Condensation Period martial artist from the Seven Profound Valleys was truly formidable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese elite nobles in the audience had only been brushed by this aura and yet they had suffered so miserably.
