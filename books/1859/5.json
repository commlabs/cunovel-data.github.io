{"id":81623,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eWe spend a quiet, comfortable evening and I can\u0027t help watching Emily for most of it. It\u0027s obvious she hasn\u0027t seen television in a while because she\u0027s mesmerized. We are watching some Cajun cooking show on public access, but to see it through her eyes, it\u0027s like we are watching the most fascinating show known to man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put a little mo\u0027 wine in here, maybe a little mo\u0027 wine fo\u0027 me,\" the host says in a Creole southern drawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my gosh! Ethan, he is so funny! \u0027I gar-un-tee\u0027!\" she laughs as she mimics the chef, and I can\u0027t help the smile that cracks across my face. She could let the world swallow her whole with the weight of her situation, but she doesn\u0027t. Instead she carries on, seemingly carefree, laughing at the talkative old cook with the gift of gab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glances over at me, still laughing at the TV. It\u0027s the moment I know I\u0027m making the right decision. I take a deep breath, ready to lay things on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on! He\u0027s going to tell a story about squirrel hunting! This\u0027ll be good!\" Emily says with enthusiasm. While I really need to get my thoughts out, I can\u0027t deny her this moment. It\u0027s so pure, so I decide to indulge her for the final five minutes of the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Cookin\u0027 Cajun finishes, Emily focuses her attention on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to talk about something?\" The light and sparkle in her eyes is amazing. She looks happy and carefree instead of nervous. She seems to assume the best of every situation. Given the circumstances, you\u0027d think she would be nervous, but instead, she acts as though we\u0027re going to talk about whether she\u0027ll make oatmeal or chocolate chips cookies next. I suddenly feel something I haven\u0027t felt in a very long time: content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I begin, though I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027m nervous, other than the fact she may say no. She may refuse my help. She may tell me to mind my own business, that she doesn\u0027t need anyone to look after her, but I have to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to stay here.\" Her mouth drops open, but no sound comes out. \"With me,\" I finish. I\u0027m not sure whether her speechlessness is a result of shock or horror. I decide to play it safe with more justification. \"You can\u0027t squat next door. It\u0027s not safe, it\u0027s illegal, and you don\u0027t need any hassles from the cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits for a moment with her eyes trained on her hands while her fingers twist with each other on her lap. Her hair is frizzy from the humidity, and despite having it pulled back, there are tiny tendrils sticking up forming an angelic halo around her face. After a few moments, she finally speaks. \"So, what do you want in return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? I\u0027m fully aware she has no money, so why would she think I would want her to pay-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not even finished with my own thought when I realize she\u0027s not talking about monetary payment. Nothing is ever free, and she thinks I want her in return for providing food and shelter. The thought strips me down to the core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shout unnecessarily, but I can\u0027t help it. I do not want that! She\u0027s hiding her face, but I can see her scrunching her eyes closed. I take a breath to calm down and explain myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I start again, much calmer than before. \"I don\u0027t want anything from you, Emily. I want to help you. I know how...\" I stop and take a deep breath. I need her to understand where I\u0027m coming from. \"I know how hard this situation can be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinches and snaps her head up to look me in the eye. \"You don\u0027t want...you know, then?\" She gestures between us to further her point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLie. \"No. The last thing I want is for you to be taken advantage of.\" While the thought of being with her physically is an attractive offer, I would never want it under that set of circumstances. I know how easy it is to become a target when you\u0027re young and in need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, why? Everyone wants something, Ethan. There has to be something you want from me. I mean, it\u0027s okay if you want... you know...\" Her cheeks flame red as she says this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, she\u0027s so naive she can\u0027t even say the word \"sex.\" It only solidifies my decision that I\u0027m doing the right thing, but she\u0027s right. People always want something in return, so I will have to give her a reason why I don\u0027t want anything from her. I have to be honest with her and let her know that I\u0027m all too familiar with her situation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-5.html","bookId":1859,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:16 PM"}
