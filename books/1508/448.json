The edge of the spiritual forest was a relatively safe location.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe moon was bright in the sky, the stars shined, and in the forest, the sounds of conversation drifted through the trees.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That damn Blood Demon, he really makes everyone uneasy. I don’t know he is, but he’s really messing with us. Every three or four days we have to change location.” The one who spoke was a black-armored man who held a spear in his hands.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis black armor and spear were common battlefield equipment given to soldiers of the South Sea Demon Region. The Blood Demon that the black-armored man spoke of was a mysterious killer that had haunted the South Sea Demon Region martial artists for the past few months; everyone panicked at his name. This person was vicious, savage, and every time he killed someone he would suck out all of their blood essence. This was why he was given the name Blood Demon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnother black-armored martial artist shook his head and said, “There’s nothing to complain about, this is simply what war is like. Our side’s Blood Bone, Viper, and Nightmare are also the same. They’ve killed the South Horizon Region martial artists to the point that they don’t dare to show their faces. Now most of them have withdrawn to the Wartime Alliance headquarters and are too scared to even come out.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSince the Blood Demon was so vicious, the Big Three of the South Sea Demon Region naturally wouldn’t idly sit by and let this happen. They also killed a massive amount of Wartime Alliance soldiers. Although the Wartime Alliance had a great number of martial artists, it was a very mixed bag of quality. The majority were second rank or third rank soldiers. Compared to the Big Three South Sea Demon Region masters, they were just cannon fodder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I wonder how strong Blood Bone, Viper, and Nightmare are compared to that Blood Demon?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who knows? Blood Demon is extremely strong, and also very mysterious. In fact, no one knows if he’s a single person or a squad. It would be nice if the sect could send a Revolving Core Elder to South Aurora Island to clear up this Blood Demon.” The black-armored martial artist said. The South Aurora Battlefield couldn’t be considered important, all it had was a medium-grade true essence stone vein deposit as well as a parcel of spiritual forest. South Aurora Island simply wasn’t important to the war situation, and even if it was taken it wouldn’t be much help, so why would a Revolving Core powerhouse come? Not just that, but finding this Blood Demon in so many thousands of miles was not an easy task.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hey, don’t count on those Revolving Core Elders to do anything. Who knows what those old men are doing. The battlefront has paused here at Blood Demon Island and South Aurora Island for almost half a year, and yet they haven’t advanced in the least. If this continues, life will just be wasted on the battlefield. Divine Phoenix Island and the South Sea Demon Region are much smarter.

He flourished his spear and rushed out just in time to see the bodies of his two brothers burst open, and two bloody symbols fly out from their bodies. It was clear that these bloody symbols had ripped apart his brothers’ bodies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Blood Demon!” The black-armored man’s eyes were filled with a crazy light, “Everyone below Xiantian, spread out!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe black-armored man issued this command that he thought was wise, however it had no meaning. As long as it was a peak Houtian or half-step Xiantian martial artist, as long as they were struck by this blood symbol it would be fatal!

As this shadow stood within the trees, half his face covered by darkness and the other have covered by the mercurial moonlight, he looked like a killing god.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTwelve Blood Drinking Seals flew back through the air, spinning around the edge of the halberd.

Not only did the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’ contain skills, but also a cultivation method. Otherwise, if one was only skilled in moves, they would at most be able to defeat martial artists at the same level.

In these two months, Lin Ming had rarely gone to battle with the Fire Ax Squad.
