Each of the six took place in a different region of the system, and in each case I made use of the astronomical facts-as they were then known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, a quarter-century later, Fawcett is bringing out the novels in new editions; but what a quarter-century it has been! More has been learned about the worlds of our Solar System hi this last quarter-century than in all the thousands of years that went before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLUCKY STARR AND THE RINGS OF SATURN was written in 1957, but in 1967, a French astronomer, Audouin Dollfus, discovered a tenth satellite of Saturn, one that was closer to the planet than any of the others, 22,000 miles closer to Saturn than Mimas is. This new satellite has been named Janus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were writing the book today, I would certainly mention that satellite and I might have used it instead of Mimas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, it was not until 1977 that astronomers discovered that Saturn was not the only ringed planet. Uranus, it turns out, also has rings. They are very thin rings and very faint ones-but they\u0027re there. I would surely have mentioned that in this book if I were writing it today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope my Gentle Readers enjoy the book anyway, as an adventure story, but please don\u0027t forget that the advance of science can outdate even the most conscientious science-fiction writer and that my astronomical descriptions are no longer accurate in all respects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac Asimov\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-rings-of-saturn-lucky-starr-6/page-1.html","bookId":1759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:35 AM"}
