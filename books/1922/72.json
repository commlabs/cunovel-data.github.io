{"id":63284,"no":72,"title":"Page 72","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I get panties?\" I asked, thinking about my drawer of sexy underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. There\u0027s a phone hanging on the wall in the kitchen. Hit speed dial one and tell the man who answers that I want him to pick up double my usual dinner order from Peter Luger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" I headed out to the living room and made the call; then I had to search for Gideon. I found him in his home office, a room I hadn\u0027t been in before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t get a good look at the space at first because the only lighting came from an angled picture light on the wall and a barrister\u0027s lamp on his polished wood desk. Plus my eyes were more interested in focusing on him. He looked utterly sensual and compelling sprawled in his big black leather chair. He held a tulip glass of some liquor that he warmed between his hands and the beauty of his flexing biceps sent tingles racing through me, as did the tight lacing of muscles on his abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze was on the wall illuminated by the picture light, which snagged my attention, too. I was startled when I saw the art - a huge collage of blown-up photos of him and me: the picture of our kiss on the street outside the gym...a shot of us from the press gauntlet at the advocacy dinner...a candid of the tender aftermath of our fight in Bryant Park...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe focal point was the image in the center that had been taken while I slept in my own bed, lit only by the candle I\u0027d left burning for him. It was an intimate voyeuristic shot, one that said more about the photographer than it did the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was deeply touched by the proof that he\u0027d been falling along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon gestured at the drink he\u0027d poured for me in advance and set on the edge of his desk. \"Have a seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI complied, curious. There was an edge to him that was new, a sense of purpose and calm determination paired with laser-precise focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat brought on his mood? And what did it mean for the rest of our evening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw the small photo collage frame lying on the desktop next to my drink and my worry faded. The frame was very similar to the one already on my desk, but this one held three photos of Gideon and me together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to take that to work,\" he said quietly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" For the first time in days, I was happy. I hugged the frame to my chest with one hand, and picked up my glass with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glittered as he watched me take a seat. \"You blow kisses at me all day from your picture on my desk. I think it\u0027s only fair that you be equally reminded of me. Of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled in a rush, my heartbeat not quite steady. \"I never forget about you or us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t let you if you tried.\" Gideon took a deep drink, his throat working on a swallow. \"I think I\u0027ve figured out where we made our first misstep, the one that\u0027s led to all the stumbles we\u0027ve had since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a drink of your Armagnac, angel. I think you\u0027ll need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a cautious sip of the liquor, feeling the instantaneous burn, followed by recognition that I liked the flavor. I took a bigger drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling his glass between his palms, Gideon took another drink and eyed me thoughtfully. \"Tell me which was hotter, Eva: sex in the limo when you were in charge or sex in the hotel when I was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted restlessly, unsure of where the conversation was leading. \"I thought you enjoyed what happened in the limo. While it was happening, I mean. Obviously not later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved it,\" he said with quiet conviction. \"The image of you in that red dress, moaning and telling me how good my c**k feels inside you, will haunt me as long as I live. If you\u0027d like to top me again in the future, I\u0027m definitely game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach tensed. The muscles in my shoulders began to knot. \"Gideon, I\u0027m starting to freak out a little. All this talk of safewords and topping...it feels like this conversation is leading somewhere I can\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking of bondage and pain. I\u0027m talking about a consensual power exchange.\" Gideon studied me intently. \"Would you like more brandy? You\u0027re very pale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\" I set the drained glass down. \"It sounds like you\u0027re telling me you\u0027re a Dominant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angel, you knew that already.\" His mouth curved in a soft, sexy smile. \"What I\u0027m telling you is that you\u0027re submissive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed to my feet in a rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" he warned in a dark purr. \"You\u0027re not running yet. We\u0027re not done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" Being under someone else\u0027s thumb - losing my right to say no! - was never going to happen again. \"You know what I went through. I need control as much as you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed on my feet, just to prove my point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widened and my insides melted. \"Do you have any idea how crazy I am about you?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy all right, if you think I\u0027m going to put up with being ordered around, especially sexually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Eva. You know I don\u0027t want to beat you, punish you, hurt you, demean you, or order you around like a pet. Those aren\u0027t needs either of us has.\" Straightening, Gideon leaned forward and placed his elbows on the desktop. \"You\u0027re the most important thing in my life. I treasure you. I want to protect you and make you feel safe. That\u0027s why we\u0027re talking about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod. How could he be so wonderful and so insane at the same time? \"I don\u0027t need to be dominated!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you need is someone to trust - No. Close your mouth, Eva. You\u0027ll wait until I\u0027m finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy protest spluttered into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve asked me to reacquaint your body with acts previously used to hurt and terrorize you. I can\u0027t tell you what your trust means to me or what it would do to me if I broke that trust. I can\u0027t risk it, Eva. We have to do this right.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-72.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
