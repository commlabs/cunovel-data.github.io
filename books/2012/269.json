Before she could say anything, however, there were shouts from the Assail ship, and she swung back to see the handmaid scrambling up the side. Shit, wish I’d seen that leap . The craft was wallowing at least six paces away. ‘Princess, what is that woman doing?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handmaid drew herself up and over the rail. The deck was an eye-hurting maze of black and white wood, like a shattered mosaic. Six more helmed, chain-clad marines stood near the main mast, now drawing heavy cutlasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Assail half-blood commander wore a heavy, jewelled cloak, the thick oiled wool dyed a deep blue. Torcs of gold collared her long neck, and her head was shaved, emphasizing the angled planes of her skull. She was unarmed, and she now faced the handmaid with a look of amused surprise, lifting a hand to stay her soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking round, the handmaid saw recent storm damage – much of the rigging had been torn away, and mounds of cordage and shattered stays littered the deck. There seemed to be less than a score of hands working on repairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Inform your captain,’ said the Assail half-blood, ‘that having entered territorial waters, she must abide by the laws of High Kolanse. I am Lesser Watered Intransigent, Inquisitor of the Southern Fleet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not much of a fleet,’ the handmaid observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Inquisitor blinked. ‘A sudden storm has temporarily scattered us. To resume my message to your captain, she and her crew – including all passengers – must accept adjudication.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By “adjudication” do you mean killing?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pale-skinned woman smiled, the expression seeming to fold the two sides of her face slightly inward. ‘The Proclamation of Restitution has been sanctioned. We continue the task.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And did this fate befall the Perish?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yours is not a Perish ship.’ She frowned. ‘I sense enmity from your vessel – and that fat little girl with the pipe, she is a mage, is she not? We shall adjudicate her first.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handmaid walked back to the rail and leaned over. ‘Highness,’ she called down, ‘they’re being a little cagey regarding the Perish. Might be you were right.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Anything else that might be important?’ Felash asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Highness. Only that they want to kill us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well. Carry on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handmaid turned round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lesser Watered spoke, ‘Reach not for your weapons. Kneel. For each and every one of you, the healing of the world begins with your death. Among all the reasons to die, is there one more worthy than this? Be thankful that we give meaning to your end. Kneel.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handmaid shook her head. ‘A Pure already tried all that. Caught me off guard … for a moment or two. My will is not yours to command.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved then, rather faster than they’d expected, her hands thrusting outward, striking the bodyguards in the chest. Both warriors were lifted from their feet. Over the rail, plummeting to the waters below. She ducked at that instant, evading the Lesser’s lashing attack, and kicked at the second joint on the woman’s left leg, folding it halfway between the knee and the ankle. Her attacker stumbled, and the handmaid slipped past her, spinning round and out to one side to meet the six marines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them others were coming up from below, she saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew her fighting knives. She needed bigger weapons. The marine closest to her wielded a nice pair of cutlasses. She would take those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShurq Elalle loosed a startled oath and then leaned forward to watch the two armoured guards plunge into the choppy waters between the ships. Both men vanished in a froth of bubbles. Turning to Felash, she asked, ‘Does she need help over there?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlucked brows lifted. ‘I certainly hope not!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of fighting – blades clashing, shouts and then screams – came from the deck of the other ship. ‘Princess, this handmaid of yours, where did she come from?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, now that is a mystery.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enlighten me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do we have the time? Well, I suppose we do.’ She puffed on her pipe, her face disappearing briefly behind a plume of smoke, and then said, ‘My mother’s account, this. There were seven of them. Six remain – the seventh, well, there was some kind of private challenge that, um, failed. No matter. Now, I will grant you, they appear young, but do not let that deceive you. My mother concluded that alchemies constituted a worthwhile investment in maintaining the vigour of her six eldest daughters’ handmaids. And we daughters are of course sworn to secrecy in all such matters, perpetuating the illusion that we have simply grown up with our loyal companions, and so on …’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-269.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
