Saal grabbed the Kig-Yar leader and dragged him back toward the windows and out of the direct line of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you two realize what you are doing?\" the Kig-Yar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaal cocked his head. \"We are kidnapping you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReth did not find it as amusing as Saal seemed to. \"There are hundreds of thousands of Unggoy out there, all who are at my command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are out there,\" Saal said. \"But you and I know they cannot all get in here.\" And Saal chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you plan on doing what then?\" Reth hissed. \"You are meddling in extraordinarily important affairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel ducked behind the doorframe as more Unggoy spilled out into the far side of the corridor. One stumbled when he saw Thel duck back around with his plasma rifle. \"Sangheili! Defend the Redoubt!\" it screamed, and the back of its methane tank exploded from another accurate shot. Flaming debris struck other Unggoy, who lost their cohesive charge down the corridor and scattered, trying to pat the flames away before they got burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should hold them for a bit,\" Thel muttered. But then to his surprise, the Unggoy turned back toward him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were some very determined Unggoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have something to fight for,\" Reth shouted. \"Sangheili, you don\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on. You must free me. I can save your lives. I swear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel watched the Unggoy charge. There was little love between the Kig-Yar and Sangheili -- Reth\u0027s kind resented the position Sangheili held in the Covenant. And the Sangheili regarded the Kig-Yar as little more than scavengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel suspected Reth was lying and would happily have them killed the moment they set their weapons down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Reth pressed on nonetheless. \"You are the Sangheili from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetribution\u0027s Thunder, am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was Zhar taking so long? Thel shot another handful of Unggoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore came up the elevators and stairs and ran forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a mistake. We should not have betrayed you to those Jiralhanae,\" Reth said in as soothing a voice as a Kig-Yar could. \"But we needed you to not interfere! Not after all the work we\u0027ve done so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel shook his head. \"What is done is done. You have made your choices. Now we are making ours.\" Way too many Unggoy were rushing up to the top floor, flooding over dead bodies in the hall. Thel knew they were going to continue until he ran out of the charge in his plasma rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go against the Hierarchs!\" Reth shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaal backhanded the Kig-Yar. \"We are on a direct mission for the Hierarchs. Do not dare blaspheme like that. As if you speak for the Hierarchs ...\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel saw out of the corner of his eye that the Kig-Yar looked stunned. \"Which Hierarch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Prophet of Regret himself,\" Saal proclaimed proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReth shook his head. \"Wrong Prophet,\" he muttered, the feathered spines on his head wavering in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong Prophet? Saal and Thel looked at each other, and then Saal shouted, \"Zhar is up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough a column of disturbed air rippled just outside the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blow the windows out!\" Thel ordered. He shut the doors and locked them against the Unggoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaal used a sticky grenade on the thick windows. The blue light pulsed, and then Thel grabbed Reth to shield him as the explosion shook the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlass shards flew out, and the thunder of engines filled the room, bringing the acrid clouds of methane mist with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel hoisted Reth onto his back. \"You scream, struggle, or move about, you will regret it dearly. Now take a deep breath while there\u0027s still some air!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed Saal out onto the lip of the window, looking at the slope of the repurposed ship stretching out before him. They didn\u0027t want to go that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlide off the edge, they\u0027d have a very long fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel pulled himself and the weight of the Kig-Yar up, using his hands and legs to crawl up onto the slope of metal above the windows. Saal scrambled up ahead, unencumbered, to the top of the ship, where the shuttle hovered, waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed one last tactic to gain them some time. Thel pulled out a pair of grenades and let them roll down toward the slope of the hull. As they dropped by his feet he kicked them in through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambled up after Saal as fast he could, the grenades\u0027 explosions blowing red flame and debris out of the windows underneath him as he ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unggoy pilot stood in the back of the shuttle, eyes wide in stunned surprise as he watched them run toward him. Zhar gently touched the top of the old Kig-Yar wreck with the shuttle and Saal and Thel leapt aboard. The tips of other grounded ships poked out of the thick, ruddy mists all around them like towers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it up!\" Saal shouted forward, and they accelerated away, the structure dwindling at the top of the falls, the crater lake falling into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter THIRTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHABITAT EL CUIDAD, INNER RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being left alone, Ignatio Delgado had still not managed to free himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was, trying to use a sliver of metal to pick the lock of a pair of handcuffs was a challenging proposition. And Delgado couldn\u0027t even get the sliver to reach the keyhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a loud sigh the one guard in the warehouse stood up and folded up whatever he\u0027d been watching and pocketed it. \"Alright, Delgado, things are settling down. Time to get you moved out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado nodded, filled with a sense of foreboding. This was it, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard noticed the look on his face. \"Come on, Delgado. It\u0027s not like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Delgado looked the heavily muscled man up and down. \"How is it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shrugged. \"All Bonifacio and the Security Council know is that the data keeps getting found out. Better to keep you on close watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado shook his head. \"Then why are you doing this? Why the hired muscle, the empty warehouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It keeps you under his eye. He doesn\u0027t trust you, Delgado. You\u0027re a wild card, man.\" Delgado was unshackled from the chain, then handcuffed to the man\u0027s right wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shove, Delgado was pushed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" Delgado asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your real name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owen\" asked, looking down at Delgado as he herded him outside to a waiting tube car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" Delgado asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen smiled. \"One of Bonifacio\u0027s working ships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado frowned. \"Working ships? He have a lot of broken ones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. \"Look.\" Owen leaned in close, almost whispering. \"Relax a little, Delgado. Bonifacio\u0027s going to be in a foul mood because his smuggler ship, it just got fried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen was laughing. \"The best-laid plans ... Someone really doesn\u0027t like Bonifacio. They fried his ship. It\u0027s structurally intact, but nothing inside it works; the data got wiped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado swallowed. The Spartans had struck again. \"So now Bonifacio needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tube car stopped after making its way between a handful of coupled asteroids. Owen opened the door, and Delgado quickly followed him to avoid being yanked along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Bonifacio stood near an airlock, along with a handful of Security Council members. Including Diego Esquival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen unlocked the handcuffs, and Delgado massaged his wrists. \"What\u0027s this all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the navigation data, Mr. Delgado?\" one of the suited Security Council members asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado stood still for a second. \"Safe. As we agreed on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego pursed his lips. \"Bonifacio presented evidence to the council that there are Earth-first elements within our population that have attacked any navigation data that might lead ships of any sort back to Earth or the Inner Colonies. The data you have needs to be transported to its final destination, where it will be better safeguarded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Final destination?\" Delgado looked around at them. \"What final destination? The Kig-Yar? Come on, you know where that will lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re moving it to the Exodus Project,\" said one of the councilmen, an older man with scars across his face. \"It\u0027s final. We\u0027ve all voted. So please, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado, give up the data. You\u0027ve served the Rubble well. It\u0027s time to hand it over now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is this Exodus Project?\" Delgado snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a big emergency plan,\" Diego said. \"We can\u0027t talk about the particulars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it needs nav data?\" Delgado looked at Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Diego nodded, and spread his arms. \"It really does, Ignatio. Please, trust me on this. Trust the Council as the Rubble\u0027s elected leaders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado looked at the other members. They didn\u0027t look like they meant him any ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was it the right choice, whatever they had in mind? Delgado took a deep breath. It wasn\u0027t his decision to make, was it? The Rubble had elected the entire Council for a reason. The Council had hired Delgado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no longer keeper of the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Delgado said. \"It\u0027s aboard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to key everything open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego laughed. \"In plain sight, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best place.\" For a quick moment, everything felt okay. Maybe even normal. Delgado relaxed slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation was shattered as Peter Bonifacio stepped forward. \"I\u0027ll take him over to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia, then meet the rest of you at Exodus. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia only has a light guard on it. It\u0027s an easy target. My guards aren\u0027t just Rubble Defense volunteers, they have actual fighting experience.\" There was accusation in his glare, and Delgado saw a few nod in agreement. It looked like Bonifacio had been knocking Delgado\u0027s ability, to keep the data safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego came forward. \"I go with you.\" He and Delgado shared a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonifacio shrugged. \"I\u0027d be delighted to have you aboard, Councilman, as well as anyone else who wants to come. Keep in mind, my ship\u0027s quarters are cramped. This way.\" He held out his hand, indicating that they should go first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis guards had already cycled through the airlock into the ship Bonifacio had waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a cramped ship, a converted tug of some sort. It had probably once grappled dirty asteroids and pushed them into new orbits to be harvested by the miners and their processing plants. Now it was Bonifacio\u0027s personal transport. Quick enough, Delgado thought, looking around the extended\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecockpit once they\u0027d come in through the airlock. But still a bit over the top. Who had a personal ship just for transport in the Rubble? It was part of Bonifacio\u0027s desire to preen and make a point of showing how special he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonifacio got inside, gave the order to leave, and turned to Delgado. In the darkly lit cockpit he looked birdlike, his eyes pools of beady darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone fried my ship, everything electrical was shorted, and several good men guarding it are dead. That costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear it,\" Delgado said, eyeing the three large guards now surrounding him in the tiny cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego chuckled, and Bonifacio turned to him. \"This amuses you? The future of the Rubble is laughable? I\u0027m working hard to make sure we have a future, despite your meddling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A future?\" Diego shook his head. \"You\u0027re full of shit, Bonifacio. You care about future profits, not the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" Bonifacio reached into his pocket, hands trembling slightly, face red. \"Were you all so high-and-mighty when the Covenant first came? Tell Delgado the real story, and how you all, in your democratic glory, turned to one person when it all came to a head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonifacio shook his head and pulled out a Sweet William. He pointed the cigar at Diego. \"They tell you how the Kig-Yar contact really happened? I\u0027ll bet not. Because it doesn\u0027t make those men look good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lit the cigar and drew in a long pull, then laughed, cigar smoke puffing out of his mouth. \"They crapped their pants when that first Kig-Yar ship swung by the Rubble, scanning us, checking everything out. Wanted to know what to do. Attack it, or try to pack up and run to some other part of the system? And if attack, how? But they were taking so long to deliberate, I did something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hailed it. And I offered to trade. Sent them a manifest of everything I could imagine we had in our storage areas. I explained we weren\u0027t UNSC, that we hated them. That we were rebels. Because, really, even other species have to know about trade, right, Delgado? Economics, that\u0027s universal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone wants to better themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the real first encounter?\" Delgado asked. \"So it\u0027s the second where their ship appeared and offered to trade and set up in the Rubble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A month later. Some sort of Kig-Yar big shot named Reth had a box that could translate their speech into ours. Like they\u0027ve been studying us,\" Diego said. \"And they wanted to trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonifacio nodded. \"We took guns off them to sell to our brothers, where we could smuggle them back to the colonies, in exchange for goods. The Kig-Yar, in turn, wanted Slipspace drives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slipspace drives?\" Delgado frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turns out the Kig-Yar are pretty low on the Covenant totem pole.\" Bonifacio smirked. \"They\u0027re not allowed to build drives for their own ships. Its engineering is all done by the ones they call Prophets. Closed boxes for the Kig-Yar. See, they\u0027re not the monolithic juggernaut the UNSC makes them out to be, this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant. They have divisions and inequalities. And where those exist, we have what you call a market, Mr. Delgado. Combine the engines with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarth\u0027s location, and the Rubble will do more for the Insurrection than any other place in history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what happens when the Kig-Yar slip up and we\u0027re all found out?\" Delgado asked. \"The Covenant will be back to glass us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We leave,\" Diego muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, exodus, exodus, exodus,\" Bonifacio waved his cigar around. \"Diego, we have spent so long building all this. And you want to run away from it?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-23.html","bookId":1638,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM"}
