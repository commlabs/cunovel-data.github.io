We melt into ONE at the touch of infinity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Raja Flattery, The Book of Ship\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM THE instant the Redoubt\u0027s first hatchway exploded, Jesus Lewis stayed within arm\u0027s length of his bodyguard, Illuyank. It was partly a conscious decision. Even in the worst of times, Illuyank inspired a certain confidence. He was a heavily muscled man, dark-skinned, with black wavy hair and a stone-cut face accented by three blue chevrons tattooed above his left eyebrow. Three chevrons - Illuyank had run outside around the Colony Perimeter three times, naked, armed only with his wits and endurance, \"running the P\" for a bet or a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTesting their luck, some called it. When the hatch blew, they all needed luck. Some of them were barely awake and had not yet eaten their first dayside meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clones got a lasgun!\" Illuyank shouted. His clear, dark eyes worked the area. \"Dangerous. They don\u0027t know how to use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men stood in a passage between the clones\u0027 quarters and a random huddle of survivors who waited behind them near a half-circle of hatches leading to the core of the Redoubt. Even in this moment of peril, Lewis knew how he must appear to the others. He was a short man, thin all the way - thin straw-colored hair, thin mouth, thin chin made even more so by a deep cleft, a thin nose, and oddly dark eyes which never seemed to reflect light in the thin compression of his lids. Beside him, Illuyank was everything Lewis was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth stared toward the core of the Redoubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a real question in their minds whether the core of the Redoubt remained secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing this, Lewis had deactivated the communications pellet buried in the flesh of his neck and refused to answer it even when insistent calls from Oakes tempted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo telling who might be able to listen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been some disquieting indications lately that their private communications channel might not be as private as he had hoped. By now, Oakes would have received word about the new Ceepee. Discussion of that and the possible breach of their private communications system would have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes would have to be patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first sign of trouble, Lewis had hit an emergency signal switch to alert Murdoch at Colony. There was no certainty, though, that the signal had gone through. He had not been allowed time for a retransmit-check. And the whole Redoubt had gone onto emergency power then. Lewis had no way of knowing which systems might be working and which not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damned clones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud whirr sounded from the direction of the clones\u0027 quarters. Illuyank flattened himself on the floor and the others were showered with shards of passage wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought they didn\u0027t know how to use that lasgun!\" Lewis shouted. He pointed at a gaping hole in the wall as Illuyank leaped up and spun him around toward the others at the hatch circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Downshaft!\" Illuyank called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the waiting group whirled the downshaft hatchdogs and opened the way into a passage lighted only by the blue flickering of emergency illumination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis sprinted blindly behind Illuyank, heard the others scrambling after them. Illuyank shouted back at him as he ran: \"They don\u0027t know how to use it and that\u0027s what makes it dangerous!\" Illuyank tucked and rolled across an open side passage as he spoke, firing a quick burst down the passage from his gusgun. \"They could hit anything anywhere!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis glanced down the open passage as he ran past, glimpsed a scattering of bodies blazing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt soon became apparent where Illuyank was leading them and Lewis admired the wisdom of it. They took a left turn into a new passage, then a right turn and found themselves in the Redoubt\u0027s unfinished back corridors, skirting the native rock of the cliffside into the small Facilities Room on the beach side. One plasma-glass window overlooked the sea, the courtyard and the corner where the clones\u0027 quarters joined the Redoubt itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of the followers dogged the hatch behind them. Lewis took quick stock of his personnel - fifteen people, only six of them from his personally chosen crew. The others, rated reliable by Murdoch, had not yet been tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlluyank had moved to the maze of controls at the cliff wall and was poring over the Redoubt\u0027s schematics etched into a master plate there. It occurred to Lewis then that Illuyank was the only survivor from Kingston\u0027s mission to this chunk of dirt and rock named Black Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this how it was with Kingston?\" Lewis asked. He forced his voice to an even calm while watching Illuyank trace a circuit with one stubby finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kingston cried and hid behind rocks while his people died. Runners got him. I cooked them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooked them out! Lewis shuddered at the euphemism. The grotesque image of Kingston\u0027s head crisped to char grinned across his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us what to do.\" Lewis was surprised at his control under this fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Illuyank looked directly at him for the first time. \"Good. Our weapons are these.\" He indicated the power switches and valve controls around them. \"We can control every circuit, gas and liquid from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis touched Illuyank\u0027s arm and pointed to a one-meter square panel beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Illuyank hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re blind otherwise,\" Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor answer, Illuyank tapped out a code on the console beneath the square. The blank panel slid back to reveal four small view-screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sensors,\" one of those behind them said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eyes and ears,\" Lewis said, still looking at Illuyank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark man\u0027s expression did not change, but he whispered to Lewis: \"We also will have to see and hear what we do to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis swallowed and heard a faint snap-snapping at the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re cutting in!\" a voice quavered behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis and Illuyank scanned the screens. One showed the rubble that had been the clones\u0027 quarters. I\u0027M HUNGRY NOW!, the new rallying cry of the clones, was smeared in yellow grease across one wall. The adjoining screen scanned the courtyard. A crowd of mutated humans - E-clones all - scoured the grounds for rocks and bits of glass, anything for a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep an eye on them\" Illuyank whispered. \"They can\u0027t hurt us with that stuff, but all that blood out there will bring demons. There are holes all over our perimeter. If demons hit, they\u0027ll catch that bunch first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis nodded. He could hear some of the others pressing close for a better view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, there was that snap-snapping at the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis glanced at Illuyank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re just pounding at us with rocks,\" Illuyank said. \"What we have to do is find that lasgun. Meanwhile, keep an eye on the courtyard. The bloo....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lower left-hand screen showed the clone mess hall, a shambles of security hatches broken open in the background, a turmoil of clones throughout the area. This screen suddenly went blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sensor\u0027s gone in the mess hall,\" Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Food will keep them busy there for a time,\" Illuyank said. He was busy searching through the Redoubt on the remaining screen. It showed a flash of the courtyard from a different angle, then a broken tangle of perimeter wall, cut to pieces by the lasgun and swarming with clones coming in from the outside where Lewis had ejected them, the action which had ignited this revolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to cull them somehow, Lewis told himself. The food will go only so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention to the screen showing the courtyard. Ye.... there was a lot of blood. It made him aware that he was badly cut himself. Celltape stopped his major bleeding, but small cuts began to ache as he thought of his condition. None of them was without injury. Even Illuyank bled slightly from a rock cut above his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Illuyank said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice coincided with a new thump and crackling agitation at the hatch. But the COA screen Illuyank had been using now showed the passage outside their hatch. It was filled with a mass of clone flesh: furred bodies, strange limbs, oddly shaped heads. At the hatch two of the strongest clones were trying to maneuver a plasteel cutter, but their actions were impeded by the press of others behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll get them in here for sure,\" someone said. \"We\u0027re cooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlluyank turned and barked orders, pointing, waving a hand until all fifteen were busy in the Facilities Roo...valve to control, a switch to throw; each had some particular responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis keyed for sound in the screen and a confused babble came over the speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlluyank signaled to a man at the remote valve controls across the room. \"Dump the brine tanks into level two! That\u0027ll flood the outer passage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man worked his controls, muttering as he followed the schematics at his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlluyank touched Lewis on the elbow, pointed to the screen which showed the courtyard. The clones there were looking away from the sensor, all of them at full alert, their attention on a broken segment of wall which led to the perimeter. Abruptly, almost as one organism, they dropped their rocks and glass weapons and ran screaming off-screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Runners,\" Illuyank muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis saw them then, a waving swarm of tiny pale worm shapes cresting the rubble. He could almost smell the burned acid and tasted acid in his throat. Automatically, he gave the orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seal off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t,\" a timid voice from the edge of the room began. \"Some of our people are still out there. If we seal of.... if w.... they\u0027ll al....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll all die,\" Lewis finished for him. \"And our perimeter\u0027s full of holes. Runners are in the courtyard. If we don\u0027t seal off we die, too. Seal off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed to a valve-control panel, punched the proper sequence. Lights above the panel showed that the indicated valve was closing. He could hear others around him obeying. Illuyank\u0027s voice intruded with a quiet warning: \"Check the surface shafts.\" This brought another bustle of activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis glanced at the courtyard screen. A clone stumbled back into the sensor\u0027s range, screaming and beating at his eyes with the blunt knobs which passed for his hands. As he moved into range, he fell and lay twisting on the ground. A blur of writhing shadows swept over him. The courtyard filled with fleeing clones and tiny, eel-like bodies. Behind Lewis, one of their group could be heard vomiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re in the passage,\" Illuyank said. He gestured at the sensor where the view outside their hatch showed brine rising in the passage with a swarming mass of Nerve Runners riding in on the wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shot a frantic glance at the hatch. What the sensor revealed was happening right out there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brine stopped short of the passage ceiling, but not before it had shorted out the plasteel cutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClones were thrashing in the water, Nerve Runners covering them, but here and there dead Runners could be seen on the brine\u0027s surface. And where the plasteel cutter had shorted out, a milky gray gas clouded the thin space over the water. Wherever the gas touched, Runners died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis felt his mind leaping from item to item. Item: brine. Item: electrical short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chlorine,\" he whispered. Then louder: \"Chlorine!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Illuyank was clearly puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis pointed at the screen. \"Chlorine kills Nerve Runners!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s chlorine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A gas created when you throw an electrical charge through sodium chloride brine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bu....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chlorine kills Runners!\" Lewis looked across the Facilities Room where the plaz-glass barrier showed a corner of clone area and the ocean beyond. \"Are the sea pumps still working?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man at the pump console checked his keyboard, then: \"Most of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sea water wherever we can put it,\" Lewis said. \"We need a large container where we can dump it from here and throw an electrical charge through it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water purification,\" Illuyank said. \"The purification plant. We can pump almost everywhere from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a bit,\" Lewis said. \"We want to attract as many Runners as we can; make them easier to wipe out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the screens, dragging it out, then: \"All right, let\u0027s hit them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, Illuyank scanned his schematics, throwing orders over his shoulder while the survivors in the Facilities Room obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis fixed his attention on the sensor screens. The outer passage was quiet no...few dead E-clones floating on the surface of the brine, many dead Runners among them. He tuned the mess-room screen to another sensor eye, found the exercise bay outside the clone labs. It was filled with a thrashing crowd of E-clones in absolute panic and, here and there among them, some of his own people caught outside when he had given the order to seal off. There were not many recognizable faces, but the colors of the uniforms could be identified. One by one, they died, their mouths frothing pink and their last stares turned upward toward the sensor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the last of them were dying, a milky cloud of gas had begun to sweep out of an open passage, drifting across the scene, blurring it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch their eyes,\" Illuyank said. \"If we don\u0027t get all the Runners, they\u0027ll go for the eyes first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll was quiet in the Facilities Room then as the survivors listened to their own precious breath, felt the comfort of their own live sweat and watched the eyes of the dead outside for some reflection of their own mortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis leaned against the lip of the console, feeling cold metal under his fingers. Other screens showed more of the milky gas billowing through the Redoubt. There were even sensor eyes still alive to show the area outside their perimeter, the gas drifting across the open ground there. Illuyank scanned from sensor to sensor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone behind Lewis heaved a shuddering sigh and Lewis echoed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chlorine,\" Illuyank muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be able to sterilize the Runner boils right out of existence now,\" Lewis said. \"If we\u0027d only know....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nasty way to learn,\" someone behind them said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd someone else said: \"It\u0027ll be a long wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting\u0027s that way,\" Illuyank said. \"Think how long you live if you\u0027re always waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an insightful comment, deeper than anything Lewis had ever expected from Illuyank. And it meant that Illuyank would have to be shifted to a tour of duty Colony side. He saw too much, deduced too much. That could not be permitted. First, though, they had to get out of here. But there was no way out except into the Runner-contaminated open areas of the Redoubt. The chlorine would make that possibl.... in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we get a message to Murdoch?\" Lewis asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emergency transmitter only,\" Illuyank said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him the emergency shut-down signal. No one comes in here until we\u0027ve cleaned up. It wouldn\u0027t do to have anyone see what\u0027s happened an....\" Lewis directed a loaded look at Illuyank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlluyank nodded, and provided Lewis with the perfect opening for what had to be done. \"Someone should go Colonyside, though, and see that they understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That had better be you,\" Lewis said. \"Make sure they don\u0027t try to explain anything to The Boss shipside. That\u0027s my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell them any more than you have to. An.... while you\u0027re there, try to circulate in the Colony - everything normal, routine.
