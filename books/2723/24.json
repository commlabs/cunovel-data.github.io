She\u0027s got better things to do than look at dusty old pictures.\" Susannah winked at me. \"Belly, you look fresh as a daisy. I love you in white with your tan. It sets you off like a picture frame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Susannah,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t all that dressed up, but I wasn\u0027t in shorts like the night of the bonfire. I was wearing a white sundress and flip-flops, and I\u0027d put my hair in braids while it was still wet. I knew I\u0027d probably take them out in about half an hour because they were so tight, but I didn\u0027t care. They were cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do look lovely. Where are you headed?\" my mother asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to a party,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother frowned and said, \"Are Conrad and Jeremiah going to this party too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not my bodyguards,\" I said, rolling my eyes. \"I didn\u0027t say they were,\" my mother said. Susannah waved me off and said, \"Have fun, Belly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e139\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" I said, shutting the door before my mother could ask me any more questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d hoped that Conrad and Jeremiah had just been kidding around, that they weren\u0027t really gonna try to come. But when I ran down the stairs to meet Cam\u0027s car, Jeremiah called out, \"Hey, Belly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Conrad were watching TV in the family room. I poked my head in the doorway. \"What?\" I snapped. \"I\u0027m kind of in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah turned his head toward me and winked lazily. \"See you soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad looked at me and said, \"What\u0027s with the perfume? It\u0027s giving me a headache. And why are you wearing all that makeup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t wearing that much makeup. I had some blush and mascara and a little lip gloss, that was it. It was just that he wasn\u0027t used to me wearing any. And I\u0027d sprayed my neck and wrists, that was all. Conrad sure hadn\u0027t minded Red Sox girl\u0027s perfume. He\u0027d loved her perfume. Still, I took one last look at myself in the mirror in the hallway--and I rubbed a little of the blush off, also the perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I slammed the door shut and ran down the driveway, where Cam was turning in. I\u0027d been watching from my bedroom window so I\u0027d know the exact moment he drove up, so he wouldn\u0027t have to come inside and meet my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e140\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped into Cam\u0027s car. \"Hi,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi. I would\u0027ve rung the doorbell,\" he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, it\u0027s better this way,\" I said, suddenly feeling very shy. How is it possible to talk to someone on the phone for hours and hours, to even swim with this person, and then feel like you don\u0027t know them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this guy Kinsey, he\u0027s kind of weird, but he\u0027s a good person,\" Cam told me as he backed out of the driveway. He was a good driver, careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasually I asked, \"Does he by any chance sell crystal meth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, not that I know of,\" he told me, smiling. His right cheek had a dimple in it that I hadn\u0027t noticed the other night. It was nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relaxed. Now that the crystal meth stuff was out of the way, there was only one more thing. I twisted the charm bracelet on my wrist over and over and said, \"So, you know those guys I was with at the bonfire? Jeremiah and Conrad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your fake brothers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I think they might be stopping by the party too. They know, um, Kinsey,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" he said. \"Cool. Maybe they\u0027ll see that I\u0027m not some kind of creep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t think you\u0027re a creep,\" I told him. \"Well, they kind of do, but they\u0027d think any guy I talk to is a creep, so it\u0027s nothing personal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e141\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must really care about you a lot to be so protective,\" he said. Did they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, not really. Well, Jeremiah does, but Conrad is all about duty. Or he used to be anyway. He should\u0027ve been one of those samurais.\" I glanced over at him. \"I\u0027m sorry. Is this boring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, keep talking,\" Cam said. \"How do you know about samurais?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucking my legs under my butt, I said, \"Ms. Baskerville\u0027s global studies class in ninth grade. We did a whole unit on Japan and Bushido. I was, like, obsessed with the idea of seppuku.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad\u0027s half-Japanese,\" he said. \"My grandmother lives there, so we go out and visit her once a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow\" I\u0027d never been to Japan, or anywhere in Asia for that matter. My mother\u0027s travels hadn\u0027t taken her there yet either, though I knew she wanted to go. \"Do you speak Japanese?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" he said, rubbing the top of his head. \"I get by okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whistled--my whistle was something I was proud of. My brother, Steven, had taught me. \"So you speak English, French, and Japanese? That\u0027s pretty amazing. You\u0027re like some kind of genius, huh,\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I speak Latin, too,\" he reminded me, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Latin\u0027s not spoken. It\u0027s a dead language,\" I said, just to be contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e142\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not dead. It\u0027s in every Western language.\" He sounded like my seventh-grade Latin teacher, Mr. Coney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we pulled up to this guy Kinsey\u0027s house, I kind of didn\u0027t want to get out of the car. I loved the feeling of talking and having somebody really listen to what I had to say. It was like a high or something. In this weird way, I felt powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe parked in the cul-de-sac--there were a ton of cars. Some were halfway on the lawn. Cam walked quickly. His legs were so long that I had to hurry to keep up. \"So how do you know this guy?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my supplier.\" He laughed at the expression on my face. \"You\u0027re really gullible, Flavia. His parents have a boat. I\u0027ve seen him down at the marina. He\u0027s a nice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked right in without knocking. The music was so loud I could hear it from the driveway. It was karaoke music--there was a girl singing \"Like a Virgin\" at the top of her lungs and rolling around on the ground, her mike getting twisted up in her jeans. There were ten or so people in the living room, drinking beer and passing around a songbook .\"Sing \u0027Livin\u0027 on a Prayer\u0027 next,\" some guy urged the girl on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of guys I didn\u0027t recognize were checking me out--I could feel their eyes on me, and I wondered if I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e143\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally had worn too much makeup. It was a new thing to have guys looking at me, much less asking me on dates. It felt equal parts amazing and scary. I spotted the girl from the bonfire, the one who liked Cam. She looked at us, and then she looked away, sneaking glances every once in a while. I felt bad for her; I knew how that felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also recognized our neighbor Jill, who spent weekends at Cousins--she waved at me, and it occurred to me that I\u0027d never seen her outside of the neighborhood, our front yards. She was sitting next to the guy from the video store, the one who worked on Tuesdays and wore his name tag upside down. I\u0027d never seen the lower half of his body before, he was always standing behind the counter. And then there was the waitress Katie from Jimmy\u0027s Crab Shack without her red-and-white striped uniform. These were people I\u0027d been seeing every summer for my whole life. So this is where they\u0027d been all this time. Out, at parties, while I\u0027d been left out, locked away in the summer house like Rapunzel, watching old movies with my mother and Susannah. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-24.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
