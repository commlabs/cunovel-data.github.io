Our shower took a little longer than expected, but it was our first morning as husband and wife, so we felt the need to celebrate. We ate the breakfast that I’d arranged and then took the limo to the airport. I hired another driver to take us because I sent Denny and his wife to Hawaii to celebrate their anniversary while Ellery and I were in Paris. We spent two weeks honeymooning in Paris. We saw all the sights, had sex in a lot of different places, and shopped until we both collapsed from exhaustion. Before we knew it, two weeks had flown by, and it was time to fly back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELLERY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor and I spent the past two months living our lives as a happily married couple. I couldn’t believe how quickly the time had passed since the day I said I do. He went to the office every day while I spent my time helping with various charities and painting. My work was becoming known, and people were beginning to want more of my paintings. I was living the perfect life with the perfect man, and I didn’t want anything more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor stepped out of the shower and into the bedroom as I sat in bed from not feeling well. “I thought you would’ve joined me in the shower,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not feeling well, Connor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the fear sweep across his face. “What’s wrong?” He asked as he sat on the bed and stroked my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly jumped up and flew into the bathroom to vomit. Connor followed in behind me and held my hair until I was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like someone has the flu,” he said. “Get back into bed, and I’ll have Claire bring you up some tea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed into bed as Connor pulled the covers over me. He finished getting dressed and kissed me goodbye. I was starting to feel better as Claire came up to check on me. I told her I was fine as I got up and took a shower. I had too much to do today, and being sick wasn’t an option. I received a text from Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you feeling, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine. I think it was something I ate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it was. Get some rest just in case it wasn’t. I have a meeting to go to. I love you, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, and stop worrying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent that whole week not feeling well and exhausted. I was beginning to get really scared, but I didn’t let Connor know. He had enough on his plate, dealing with the trial for the Chicago fire and the new building he bought in Los Angeles. I was lying on the couch when Peyton came over. She walked in and hovered over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong? Why are you laying there like that in the middle of the day?” she demanded to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed as I sat up. “I haven’t been feeling well the past week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elle, what do you mean? Have you seen a doctor yet?” she asked with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I thought it was the flu at first, but I’m so tired. I’m scared, Peyton; what if my cancer is back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say that, and don’t think that way. What does Connor have to say about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He really doesn’t know. He knew I wasn’t feeling well a few days ago, but I’ve told him I’m fine and that I had a virus. I don’t want to worry him. This is the last thing he needs on his mind right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to call your doctor, right now,” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will next week if I don’t feel better,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you not learned from your past mistakes, Ellery Black?” she scolded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled out her phone and started dialing. “Who are you calling?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m calling Connor and telling him to get your sorry ass to the doctor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the phone out of her hand and hit end. “Peyton, stop it; I’ll call Dr. Taub.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone rang in my hand and Connor’s name appeared. “Great, now he’s calling you back,” I said as I handed her the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Connor! Sorry I must have butt-dialed you. So, do you want to tell me how it felt being on my ass?” she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and rolled my eyes. I picked up my phone, called Dr. Taub, and spoke with him directly. He told me to go to the hospital for some blood work and wait. I told Peyton we’d have to take a cab because I didn’t want Denny knowing where I was going. I couldn’t risk him telling Connor. We hailed a cab and headed to the hospital. Connor called as we were in the cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, my love,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, babe, are you having a good day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m having a fantastic day; how about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My day is going well, but it’ll be even better after I take you to lunch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get nervous as I looked at Peyton and mouthed “shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, as much as I want to have lunch with you, I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m with Peyton, and we’re going shopping. She came over, and she’s feeling a little down, so I told her shopping will lift her spirits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is she down? Is everything ok with her and Henry?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah, it’s just her time of the month; you know how that goes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough said, Ellery. Have fun, and I’ll see you tonight. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, Connor, bye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton looked at me and started laughing. “You’re good,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived at the hospital, and I headed to the lab to have my blood drawn. The nurse told me that Dr. Taub gave strict instructions to have me come upstairs to his office and wait for the results. After my blood was drawn, we stopped at the Starbucks inside the hospital and grabbed some coffee before heading up to his office. I was a nervous wreck. I felt bad for lying to Connor, but I had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to worry him until I got some answers. We patiently waited in Dr. Taub’s waiting room until the nurse called us into his office. Peyton grabbed my hand as we sat in the two seats across from his desk. “Everything will be fine, Elle,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Taub walked in his office and sat in his chair. He looked at me and then opened his file. He looked at me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got your blood work back and everything came back normal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed with relief. “Thank god. Then why have I been so tired lately?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Taub looked at me and smiled. “You’re pregnant, Ellery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut the f**k up!” Peyton blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open as I sat there in shock. “Are you sure, Dr. Taub?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’m sure. According to these numbers, you’re about eight weeks along. You need to make an appointment as soon as possible with your OB/GYN and start preparing for a healthy pregnancy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton hugged me when we stepped outside the hospital. “I’m so happy for you and Connor. I know this is what you both wanted so badly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Connor’s going to be ecstatic; I can’t wait to see the look on his face when I tell him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to the penthouse and laid down for a nap. I put my hands on my stomach and smiled. I couldn’t believe there was a baby growing inside me. This was perfect timing. Connor’s birthday is in a few days and telling him he’s going to be a father will be the best present for him. I finally fell asleep when I felt warm lips traveling across my face. I opened my eyes as Connor was staring at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ok, baby? You’re starting to worry me with all these naps you’ve been taking lately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise you that I’m perfectly fine, and there’s no need to worry about me,” I smiled. I pulled him on top of me and we made love before dinner. It was the best way to distract him from my naps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Connor’s birthday, and I couldn’t wait to give him his gift and tell him the news. It was so hard to keep my pregnancy a secret from him. I woke him up the way any man would want to be woken up. He opened his eyes and smiled as he looked down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Happy Birthday, my love,” I smiled as I took him in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a very naughty girl, but thank you,” he moaned. I made sure that he was well taken care of, and that his day started off just right. I told him to stay put as I got up, walked to the dresser, and pulled a box from the drawer. I handed it to him and told him to open it. A grin graced his face as he took the watch he wanted out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love it, Ellery; thank you,” he said as he kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You better love it since it’s the one you picked out,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, is that so?” he laughed as he pinned me to the bed and started tickling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and squirmed as I tried to make him stop. He finally did stop but only after I told him I was going to pee in the bed. I looked at him as he laid there smiling at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have another present for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe, the watch was enough,” he said as he stroked my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I racked my brain, trying to figure out what to get the man who has everything in the world. Then suddenly, a gift, something you don’t already have, fell right into my lap,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, really? What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought the back of my hand to his face and stroked it up and down as I stared into his eyes. “I’m pregnant, Connor. You’re going to be a daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me as tears formed in his eyes. “Are you 100% sure, Elle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Connor, I had the blood work done, and Dr. Taub confirmed it; Happy Birthday, daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped up and grabbed me. “I can’t believe this. The doctor said it would take a year to conceive a child. How far along are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Taub said that I’m about eight weeks along. The way I calculated it, we got pregnant on our wedding night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor hugged me tight. “That explains why you haven’t been feeling well and taking so many naps. Thank you, baby; this is the best birthday that I’ve ever had,” he whispered as he kissed me. “I can’t believe I’m going to be a father.” We made love for a couple of hours and then headed to the beach house for Connor’s birthday party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCONNOR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the best birthday that I’ve ever had. We celebrated at the beach house with about 70 close friends and family members. I made the announcement about Ellery’s pregnancy, and the whole room beamed with excitement. I still couldn’t believe it myself, and every time I looked at her, she was glowing. Ellery had arranged it so the party was mainly outside between the patio and the beach. It was a beautiful summer evening. When the last of the guests left, Ellery turned and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m exhausted,” she said as she fell into my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for the wonderful party,” I said as I kissed her on top of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have I told you lately that I love you?” she smiled as she looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tell me every day over and over again,” I smiled back as I picked her up. I held her as she wrapped her legs around me and grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, and I will never let you go. We are forever, Mrs. Black, and nothing will ever change that.” I kissed her as I carried her into the house and upstairs to bed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-40.html","bookId":1820,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM"}
