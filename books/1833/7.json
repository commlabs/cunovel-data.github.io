She just knew he’d used company money to pay for the trip. The man couldn’t keep a dime in savings. Since they had merged their two companies and she had brought in their first multimillion-dollar account, he had been living high off the hog. He had absolutely no business sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony said it didn’t matter where it came from and suggested she take the vacation as an early birthday present. He firmly believed one should never look a gift horse in the mouth. He told her he hoped she would use the time to reflect on all the wonderful words of wisdom Dr. Prick had spoken about the sanctity of marriage. She knew Tony was hoping that, once she slowed down, as one was wont to do on a vacation, she would realize how she had wronged him with her accusations and she would know in her heart that she still loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie had her own agenda. While she was being “redone,” she would work on coming up with a killer commercial that would land her company another Clio. It had been too long since she’d received the last award, almost four years now, and she was becoming more and more anxious. Advertising was a cutthroat business, and her competition, based mostly in Manhattan, was fierce. The twenty-year-old set was taking over. Some executives wouldn’t even speak to a man or woman over the age of thirty, which was why Carrie had added three young, with-it, business majors to her staff. She called the Nintendo fanatics her babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was imperative that Carrie stay in the moment, every moment. In her work, it didn’t matter how many past achievements there had been. With all the new movers and shakers pushing their way into her circle of influence, Star Catcher had to be out there as much as possible. Hollywood was a fickle town. Those with the power were only interested in who was creating the buzz that day. If Carrie didn’t keep pushing her staff to grab bigger and bigger accounts, she would find herself in the has-been category overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe owed her first Clio to her niece. She’d begged Avery to step in when the temperamental teen actress she’d hired threw a tantrum and demanded double her fee at the last moment. The silly girl thought she had Star Catcher by the balls because of the time crunch, and if Avery hadn’t come to the set with Carrie that day, Carrie would have had to pay the little bitch. Avery had been mortified by what Carrie wanted her to do, but she had a good voice and a great body, and that was all that was required. The soap commercial was a resounding success, and Carrie, acting as Avery’s agent, could have gotten her at least a year’s work. Avery wasn’t interested, though. As soon as spring break was over, she went back to finish high school and then went on to college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer niece did continue to work with Carrie every summer, but she hated leaving the office to meet with company executives. Carrie couldn’t understand her reserve. Avery didn’t seem to know—or if she did know, she didn’t particularly care—that she was, as Tony often remarked, a knockout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with her niece was that she wasn’t the least bit superficial. She was sweet and wholesome and had a firm grasp on what was important in life, and what wasn’t. But what could Carrie expect? After all, she’d raised her to sort out such things. Ironic, Carrie thought, that she herself should end up working in a field consumed with the superficial. What a hypocrite she had turned out to be. When would she learn to practice what she had constantly preached to Avery? Maybe after she made another couple of million?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie had eventually become excited about the spa. Once she had made the decision to go, she called Avery and begged her niece to join her at Utopia for one week. She knew Avery was using part of her vacation to chaperone teenagers around D.C., and Carrie tried to guilt-trip her into giving her family equal time. Carrie was feeling confident that Avery would come for at least a few days, but knew she would have heart failure if she ever found out how much the stay would cost her aunt. Carrie didn’t have any qualms about paying the fee for Avery. She would do anything for her, anything at all. Probably because Avery never asked her for anything. Carrie didn’t know how her niece could live on the tiny salary she made, and though she offered her money every time she talked to her, Avery always declined. She was doing just fine, or so she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery kept her grounded, and in the back of her mind, she knew that her niece wouldn’t let her get swept up in the moment at Utopia and sign up for every treatment available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery was going to pitch a fit when she found out that Carrie was thinking about booking an appointment for liposuction. She smiled as she thought about the argument her niece would give. Avery would shake her head when she saw her workout clothes too. Everything matched and had designer labels. Oh, yes, Avery would roll her eyes, no doubt, and then launch into her favorite lecture about getting fit and healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, how she missed the brat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you smiling about, honey?” Tony asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarred back to the present, she realized both her husband and their marriage counselor were staring at her. She shrugged to cover her embarrassment. “I was thinking about all the things I need to think about.” That nonsense was the best she could come up with on the spur of the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Prick looked pleased enough to roll around in the mud with his inner child. He nodded agreement and then stood, indicating the session was finally over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony towered over her as he walked by her side to the waiting limo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure you don’t want me to ride to the airport with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you remember to bring the reservation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She pulled away from her husband when the driver opened the back door for her. “I still haven’t heard from Avery, and I’ve left three messages for her. I was hoping to talk to her before I left L.A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know how busy she is at work. She probably just hasn’t had time to call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what if there’s an emergency while I’m away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then she’ll call me or try to get you on your cell phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like the idea of her working with children. It’s too hard for her. She—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wouldn’t do it if she didn’t love it,” he pointed out. “You’ve got to stop worrying. Avery’s a big girl now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Check my e-mails when you get home,” she said then. “Maybe she sent me a message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’ll check and call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The parole hearing is the sixteenth. I wonder if Avery was notified yet. I just got my—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course she knows. Why are you worrying about that now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t miss,” she snapped. “I always go with Avery. Both of us speak before the board decides . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, you aren’t going to miss the hearing, and neither will Avery. It’s a month away, for Pete’s sake. You didn’t miss the last one, and you won’t miss this one. Now try to relax. I want you to enjoy yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Yes, okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t sounded sincere. Frowning he said, “You’re tense because you haven’t had any time off in such a long time. It’s just last-minute jitters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again, then tried to get into the car, but Tony grabbed her by the shoulders and kissed her. “I love you,” he whispered. “I’ve always loved you. From the moment we met. I want this marriage to work again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know,” she answered, her tone dismissive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second the car pulled away from the curb, Carrie reached for her laptop. She had just turned it on when her cell phone rang. Assuming that it was Tony calling to once again nag her about their marriage, she answered curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess what?” Avery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, sweetie. I thought you were Tony. Are you enjoying your vacation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet,” she answered. “I’m finishing up some last-minute details at the office. I had a big meeting with my new boss a couple of days ago, and I can’t wait to tell you about the case I helped solve. How about sharing a late dinner in Aspen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie screeched. “You’re going to join me? All my nagging and browbeating worked?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I say yes, then you’ll just get worse. Guilt worked this time, Carrie, but don’t think—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to the kids you were going to drag around Washington?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The trip got rescheduled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. So I win by default.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me to come or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I want you to come. I’ll call Utopia right away. Have you got your flight yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m looking at the computer screen right now. I can get a connecting flight in Denver, but I won’t get in until late,” she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now I’m excited. We’re going to have such fun. Let me know your arrival time. As soon as you’ve booked it, call me back. See you soon, Avery. Love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie’s frame of mind vastly improved. She disconnected; then she called Utopia. After that, she went to work. She made notes until the limo pulled up to the airport. The lines through security moved at a snail’s pace. Carrie, shifting the strap of her carry-on from one shoulder to the other, took a palm recorder from her purse and dictated instructions for her office staff. When the plane had taken off and she was comfortably seated in business class with a chilled glass of Chardonnay, she opened her laptop and went to work again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts kept going back to Avery. She could call her now, she decided, and find out what time her flight was. She reached for the phone hooked into the armrest, then changed her mind. Better to wait. If she used the plane phone, she’d have to shout to be heard over the drum of the engines and the static, and then the other passengers around her would hear every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she got off the plane in Aspen, she moved out of the main traffic stream and sat down to dig through her carry-on for her cell phone. She’d pulled everything out before she remembered she’d stuck the phone in her purse. It wasn’t like her to be so disorganized, she thought as she closed the carry-on. She happened to glance up and see the man holding a sign with her name on it. Another limo driver, she assumed, dressed in a dark navy business suit. He was quite distinguished looking and handsome, a younger version of Sean Connery. She quickly stood as she tucked the phone in the pocket of her blazer. Adjusting the collar of her blouse, she called out, “I’m Carolyn Salvetti.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was dazzling. “Good afternoon, Mrs. Salvetti.” He had a charming British accent. The name tag pinned to his lapel read “Mr. M. Edwards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you with Utopia? . . . The spa?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I am,” he said. “Do you have your reservation with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for her travel bag. “It’s right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don’t need to see it, Mrs. Salvetti. I was to make certain you had the papers with you. Shall we go get your luggage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt ridiculous, all but running in her Manolo Blahnik slingbacks, trying to keep pace with her long-legged escort. She slipped once, and if he hadn’t grabbed her arm to steady her, she would have fallen on her face. She’d meant to change her shoes before she got on the plane, but then she’d gotten caught up in work and had forgotten about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed a phone bank that reminded her she still needed to know Avery’s flight itinerary. Damn it, she’d told her to call as soon as she’d booked her flight. Carrie knew what had happened. Avery had gotten waylaid with work and then had to run to get everything done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was probably too late to catch her at work or at home. She was probably already at the airport or perhaps on the plane now. Still, Carrie wanted to try. Maybe Avery would check her phone messages when she got to Denver. Yes, she would call as soon as they reached the baggage claim area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will any other guests be going with us to the spa?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he said. “There are two other guests. They’re waiting in the lounge. As soon as I pick up your luggage, we’ll head out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have anyone scheduled for pickup this afternoon or this evening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, this is my last trip. Why do you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My niece, Avery Delaney, is joining me at the spa.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer comment so surprised him he stopped in the middle of the corridor. “You were expecting Miss Delaney to join you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn’t she said so? “Yes,” she said. “But she’s flying out of D.C. If you aren’t scheduled to come back and pick her up, the spa must be sending another escort.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued walking. “Yes, that must be so,” he said, sounding somewhat preoccupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have Avery’s flight information, but she might have called the spa to tell them so someone would pick her up. Could you call Utopia and find out? It would be lovely if we could wait for her. I do know she’s coming through Denver,” she thought to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be happy to call the spa,” he said. Glancing around, he nodded toward a line of empty chairs in front of a deserted gate. “Why don’t you have a seat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was placing her carry-on at her feet when she asked, “What does the ‘M’ stand for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your name. ‘Mr. M. Edwards.’ What does the ‘M’ stand for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw no reason to lie. “Monk. The ‘M’ stands for Monk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How delightfully different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I prefer that all clients call me Mr. Edwards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a stiff-neck, she thought. “Yes, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’ll excuse me . . .” He moved to the window as he pulled out his cell phone. Carrie grabbed her bag and went after him. She wanted to ask him to find out if there were any messages waiting for her at the spa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis back was to her as she approached. She tapped him on the shoulder. “Mr. Edwards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, he whirled around. “Hold on,” he said into the phone. Then, “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you ask the receptionist if I have any messages?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe repeated the question, waited a moment, and then shook his head. Carrie felt foolish standing there and so she went back to the chair and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t on the phone long, and when he returned to her side, he picked up her bag and apologized for the delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is another escort assigned to Miss Delaney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t we just wait?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killjoy-buchanan-renard-3/page-7.html","bookId":1833,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:17 PM"}
