He must be brought down first, and we must be assured that he can\u0027t possibly return. We must deal with criminals without becoming criminals ourselves. If we do not, then we and our children are lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnej read what MacIntosh had to say from the Orbiter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twisp, Project Goddess has bee... intercepted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intercepted?

He massaged away a headache gathering in his forehead. Today, more than others, he was feeling the weight of his second half-century.

You all know the dangers, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp, who had fished the open seas for most of his life, knew better than any of them the fates they had just decreed for thousands on and under the ocean.

Can we count on Shadowbox?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" Mona agreed, tapping her screen. \"Timing is the key, here. The people cannot help if they don\u0027t know how. They will believe Ben Ozette, they will worship Crista Galli. They must be given a plan now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My people are infiltrating now,\" Kaleb said. His voice was calm, confident, his father\u0027s strong chin set straight ahead. \"They will be about five thousand, well-mixed throughout the poor.

Maybe someone should ask the kelp what the hell it\u0027s up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoots and wings. But let the wings grow roots and the roots fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Juan Ramon Jimenez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella Bliss unpacked three crates of moss orchids and arranged them in threes along the short walkway to the foyer of the Wittle mansion. This job had come up only the night before, and Stella\u0027s moss orchids happened to be ready. She was a sculptress of flowers, and appreciated an audience for her art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella wore her new lavender puff-sleeve blouse and a crisp pair of matching work pants. The blouse favored her breasts, tender with her recent pregnancy, but she supposed this would be the last time she\u0027d be able to get into these pants for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella skirted the security guards and servants who found excuses to watch her. The limelight made her nervous, though her stature had thrust her into the limelight often since she was a child. Twelve hands tall, Stella turned heads wherever she went, even when she went in overalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella dressed like the flowers she raised. Doob told his parents that, at home, bees followed every step she took but they never stung. Her shaggy dark hair framed a tanned face with high cheekbones and blue-green eyes. Her lips were full, often pursed with concentration. She smiled a lot lately, and had taken to humming old tunes to the new human sleeping inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing plants and engineering them for food had been Stella\u0027s family\u0027s tradition for nine generations. Since the food shortages, production and research efforts went to food. Stella had never given up on flowers or the bees that made them possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe carried the tenth generation within her, a child that she knew by her dreams would grow to be a woman like herself. She knew this as her mother had known it, as all their mothers had known it for several centuries. It was a long tradition, difficult in these difficult times. These moss orchids were of Stella\u0027s own design and she was proud that today they would be seen by other artists, by musicians, those sculptors of air, by Pandoran gentry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella had heard that His Honor Alek Dexter was colorblind, so she selected a blend that pleased herself. Most of the blossoms were in the lavender range, though she couldn\u0027t resist showing off a half-dozen of her delicate pinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small-boned security guard with a big-boned swagger poked into each of her cartons with his lasgun and silently checked the moss beds with his knife. Stella had been scanned twice and body-searched by a matron when she entered the grounds. This was not the first time, and she supposed it wouldn\u0027t be the last. Stella had some strong opinions, but preferred to concentrate on her flowers. A cordon of security closed off the entire block, and another contingent guarded the building. This was the home of the chief executive officer of Merman Mercantile, someone considered by the Director to be a prime target for the Shadows. He was rumored to be one of three men in line for the Director\u0027s position should an unforeseen unpleasantness occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sweeping structure of molded stone and plasteel, this home showed no effects from the recent series of quakes that had devastated much of Kalaloch. Its border was secured by a two-meter-high wall of rock topped with shards of sharp metal and broken glass. It was hard for her to believe that The Line for this sector passed only a block away. No one who was setting up this reception seemed at all concerned about the sounds of screams and heavy vehicles less than a stone\u0027s throw behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grim-faced security sported a flesh flower behind his ear, one of the new sculpted skin designs that she found repulsive. His underarms blossomed huge sweat rings, something more than she would attribute to the muggy afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you find in that dirt,\" she asked him when he finished, \"deadly attack worms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard scowled, his glance flicking nervously from Stella to the smoky pall that collected under the gray cap of afternoon nimbus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m losing my sense of humor,\" he growled. \"Don\u0027t push it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you afraid that the mob will come in here and -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid of anything,\" he blurted, puffing his boyish chest against baggy fatigues. \"My job is to protect Mr. Dexter, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began the tender task of removing the plants from their containers and setting them in their beds beside the walk. This was the part she liked - handling the silky vines and blind roots, smelling the loam as she broke it open. At the end of the day, when she cleaned her short nails, she did it over one of her pots so that nothing was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must like flowers, you went through a lot of pain and trouble to get the one behind your ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was drunk,\" he said. \"If they could get them to smell good, it wouldn\u0027t be so bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll come up with something, you\u0027ll see. Smell these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held a lavender orchid up to him. He took it from her and put it to his nose, then allowed himself a smile. It pleased her that the tension in his face relaxed a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said, \"that would be nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this type of flower didn\u0027t have a scent until just a year ago. And it didn\u0027t blossom from moss until five years ago. I taught it how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flowers!\" The security snorted in a show of disdain, but didn\u0027t turn away. \"You can\u0027t eat flowers. You should grow something that people can eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" She put her hand to her mouth in mock surprise. \"They shoot you for growing food without a license. You don\u0027t need a license to grow flowers. Besides, your soul needs food, too. Flowers have a spiritual nutrition that you just can\u0027t measure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked less skeptical, but kept his guarded posture. She bit back the temptation to talk about her bees, because bees meant honey and fewer than a handful of people knew about her honey production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce her plants were bedded she misted them well and swept her clippings and stray dirt away from the walk. She felt a little nervous. She was stuck in town without transportation. Her neighbor, Billie, had given her a ride to the job first thing this morning. Her Cushette, though practically new, had burned out another something that meant it wouldn\u0027t start. She didn\u0027t like it in town, anyway. It wallowed in tight places and it always frustrated her. There was the tram into the central area with a transfer out but it was probably shut down because of the mobs. She didn\u0027t relish the idea of walking the ten klicks home without Doob to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stella, my dear, are you finished out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Wittle, the hostess, beckoned her from the front hatchway. She was a gray-haired, prim woman with an honest smile for everyone and a fair skin that could only be Merman-born. Though soft-spoken and delicate, Mrs. Wittle had singlehandedly saved a boatload of Pandora\u0027s finest art during that first series of quakes in \u002773. She had been a volunteer at the museum desk down under when the collapse came and commandeered an old delivery sub. Instead of saving herself, she loaded artwork into the sub even as the seams of the museum dome split, sending streams of waterspray powerful enough to slice a human in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mrs. Wittle. Do you like them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elderly woman glanced down at the walk and her eyebrows raised ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely,\" she said, and sighed. \"They were right about you, my dear. But now I have a problem and perhaps you can help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of the help that we were counting on haven\u0027t shown up toda... the troubles, you know. Could you stay awhile longer and greet our guests at the door? I have the guest list here, and name tags are on the table just inside the hatch. Of course, you are welcome to stay as my guest and enjoy the reception. Would you do that for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella had strong feelings about rich people, and they were strong negative feelings. A hundred meters away the starving poor lined up for hours to buy limited rations with their hard-earned pay. Servants of the rich handed over cards stamped \"Exception\" at the high-security back door loading dock and filled their vans with an abundance of food. Stella had worked parties like this before to be able to take home leftovers. The pay meant nothing, she had always earned more than her ration card allowed her to buy. She had never been able to figure out the red tape process for getting a ration card stamped \"Exception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut today her Cushette was not running and she had no safe way home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, \"I can stay. But I\u0027m not dresse... and I\u0027ll need a ride home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Wittle brightened and took her by the elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know what a worry you\u0027ve lifted, dear. Of course we can arrange a ride for you, you just leave that to me. Now, let\u0027s have a look at my daughter\u0027s wardrobe. She had some wonderful things that should fit you nicely. There\u0027s an elegant black dress that will look splendid on you, though I\u0027m sure that anything would look splendid on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella blushed at the compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said. \"She won\u0027t mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Wittle\u0027s face darkened for an unguarded moment, then she set her chin forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my dear, I\u0027m afraid not,\" she said. \"She was killed in that terrible scene at the college last season. Terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027... I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she had her own mind,\" Mrs. Wittle said, \"and she insisted on using it.\" Then, in a whisper, she added, \"I was so proud of her. I\u0027ll tell you the story someday, this is not the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dress was slinky and black. The fit in the bust was uncomfortably tight, though it seemed that any pressure at all hurt her breasts lately. The neckline plunged a bit, too, showing her off as she hadn\u0027t been shown off before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish Doob could see me in this,\" she said, turning in front of a pair of mirrors. \"He\u0027d love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll just have to keep it, my dear,\" Mrs. Wittle said. Tears welled in her eyes but nothing spilled. \"In fact, I wish you\u0027d look through these clothes and take anything you can use. It\u0027s not right that they just hang here, they\u0027re not paintings, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella protested but Mrs. Wittle prepared a carton full of her daughter\u0027s clothes, then escorted Stella to her position at the small table beside the entry way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guest of honor, Alek Dexter, arrived tugging his shirtsleeves flush with the jacket cuffs and cursing the muggy afternoon. Stella pinned his name tag to his left breast and smoothed the fabric out of habit. Instead of joining the rest of the guests, he lingered beside her and unabashedly appraised her cleavage. She caught his gaze and held it until he looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been in meetings all day,\" he mumbled. \"After this shindig that the distributors put together I have to speak at a Progress Club dinner in two hours and then meet with the Director at a cocktail party at eight. No wonder I\u0027m always out of breath and can\u0027t lose weight. You look beautiful, my dear -\" he squinted at her name tag and moved closer to her chest, \"- Stella. Stella Bliss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook hands and she found his palm very sweaty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think these bigshots sweat in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sheen gathered at his forehead and upper lip and he dabbed at it with a handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Honorable Alek Dexter motioned to his driver, who lounged nearby in the cool breeze of the entry way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll need another shirt,\" he said, his voice lowered. \"Powder blue will do for tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Streets are blocked,\" his driver said. \"Couldn\u0027t make it back in time to fetch you for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice sounded sullen to Stella and she suspected from the tightening of his jaw that if there was one thing Alek Dexter did not allow in his presence it was sullenness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then buy one,\" he snapped. \"Shops are open until curfew, and the market\u0027s only a few blocks away.\" He waved his hand in dismissal. \"Take it out of petty cash. Change your attitude or change jobs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hatchway behind the driver framed a small street scene capped with a tumultuous sky. Two guards faced the street with their backs to him. A third tilted his head at the sound of three tones that came from the messenger on his belt. He picked it up, spoke into it, then hurried inside. His face seemed to pale more with each of the five steps that brought him to His Honor\u0027s side. Their conversation was brief and whispered, but Stella heard every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Code Brutus standby warning, sir. Do you want to secure here or at the compound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Alek Dexter said, and he turned his face away as though he\u0027d been slapped. He, like Mr. Wittle, was a possible successor to the Director. He rubbed his forehead while a trackful of security emptied itself out front. His face was as pale as his guard\u0027s. He watched the security squad fan out from the track and take up positions outside. A half-dozen armed men covered with grime and streaming sweat shouldered by him and stationed themselves about the reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These ours?\" he asked his guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard shrugged, his lasgun gripped white-knuckle tight in his shaking hands. \"Don\u0027t know, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph,\" he grunted. \"Guess it\u0027s hard to know what side they\u0027re on if we don\u0027t know what side we\u0027re on. Just a warning, you say? Flattery\u0027s no...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, a warning. Flattery issued it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll wait here,\" Dexter said. \"If we\u0027re going to find ourselves stuck somewhere, I\u0027d prefer it to be with this lovely young woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed, took Stella\u0027s hand and kissed it. Then he strolled inside to the hostess and her guests, passing the long table set with an array of the most beautiful fruits and seafoods that Stella had ever seen. The centerpiece was a meter-high chunk of ice carved to represent a leaping porpoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fighting sounded closer, and the security quietly closed the double hatch. Stella was more than a little afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot once had Dexter glanced at her orchids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be conscious, you must surmount illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Prudence Lon Weygand, M.D., number five, original crew member, Voidship Earthling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe series of explosions dropped by Flattery\u0027s Skyhawks from the surface wounded the green kelp in sector eight, killed tens of thousands of fishes and a pod of bottlenose porpoises and roiled up enough sediment to clog submersible filters for a fifty-click radius. A huge stand of blue kelp neighboring sector eight retracted all of its fronds instinctively and clamped itself as tight around its central lagoon as possible. In this configuration, its leaves were packed so tight that it could barely breathe. Feeding was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue kelp, when fully deployed, reached a diameter of nearly one hundred kilometers. Its outer fringes bordered domestic kelp projects for nearly 280 degrees of its circumference; the rest faced open ocean and some of it was growing daily at a visible rate. For its own safety, it kept out of contact with the domestic kelps. These were slaves to the humans, bound to the electric whip, this much the blue gathered from the dying shards that drifted its way. There would be many such shards soon. Kelp death always followed these explosions. Other deaths followed, too, at times feeding the blue kelp into an incredible spurt of growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis day something else drifted in on the currents. Something like an aura, a fragrance, something that kept the kelp from hugging itself too tight, too long. Something stirred this blue kelp deep within itself, setting its genetic memories tingling. Nothing would quite come to the fore. Soon, the blue could no longer help itself and it opened its fronds wide in hopes of a good strong whiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeed men, then ask of them virtue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurbulence from the blasts hadn\u0027t settled yet when the Flying Fish pitched, helpless, to the surface. Rico\u0027s eyes teared instantly in the sudden glare of afternoon sun that jammed the cockpit. He groped for his sunglasses and tried to blink away the afterglow. To starboard, he saw a long gray line that must be the coast. To port, two or three kilometers away, the surface seethed with a mean white froth as far as he could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA puddle of seawater widened into a pool beneath Elvira\u0027s command couch. Her nosebleed was slowing and she shook her head, trying to clear the concussion that had hit her with the first of the depth-charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnybody but Elvira would\u0027ve been scrat bait out there, Rico thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow she\u0027d made it back into the engine-room airlock by herself, though stunned and quivering from the blast. There were many other blasts, too many to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That goddamn Flattery\u0027s answer to everything is to blow it up,\" he grumbled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-20.html","bookId":2172,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:39:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:39:12 PM"}
