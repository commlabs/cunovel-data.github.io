In a flustered and exasperated manner, he said, “You… you little thing, what kind of nonsense are you spouting?! When have I ever thought about hooking up with your mom?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, he was immediately knocked down by Snow again. “A man who can’t even admit that he has no courage inside, how can someone like that hook up with my mom?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLafite’s entire face was red. He released a great roar, and then moved as fast as lightning, clawing towards the can. However, two blades brandished about with even greater speed, fiercely slicing at Lafite’s hands! Lafite’s hands immediately became tougher than steel, to the extent where there was even a faint layer of white light covering them, inserting them downwards with tremendous force!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Snow’s blades moved across Lafite’s skin, a string of sparks was unexpectedly produced! The power exerted on those blades was great, making even Lafite’s hand suddenly deviate. Even though the direction of attack didn’t change that much, Snow’s compound eyes suddenly lit up, and then it opened its mouth to bite towards Lafite’s hand! Even though Lafite didn’t fear the blades, he clearly felt restraining fear towards Snow’s mouth, his hand that was about to touch the meat couldn’t help but pull back. However, when Snow was just about to take a large bite out of the meat, its head was struck by Lafite’s finger, making it involuntarily slide back half a meter. Its six legs that were nailed to the table directly tore open the iron sheet, dragging out six deep grooves, one able to see how fierce Lafite’s attack was. In terms of power, this strike from Lafite could smash open a hole in a tank’s armor, yet Snow didn’t even show signs of dizziness. After a shriek, its limbs exerted force, body rushing up with a flash, blades frantically brandishing about, immediately exchanging several hundred strikes with Lafite! As the battle continued, Snow decided it might as well begin to shift horizontally at high speed, from time to time using its sharp limps and unstoppable mouthparts to attack, temporarily actually being evenly matched with Lafite.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLafite suddenly released a snort, taking a step back, his eyes staring fiercely at Snow. Two fine cuts were added to his fingers, clearly difficult for him to deal with Snow’s blades and limbs with limited strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“If you have the guts, then don’t use weapons!” Lafite shouted like a child.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSnow proudly brandished its blades. “Look closely, silver hair!

Curtis already stuffed his ears, but the conversation’s penetrative force still made its way into his ears. Out of helplessness, he could only mutter, “Lovestruck and narcissistic men really are just like children.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Shut up Black Steel! There’s no way I’m lovestruck! Helen can only be mine!” The flustered and exasperated Lafite turned around and roared, but due to a bit of carelessness, a few more injuries were cut open on his hand by Snow. Snow’s speed was inconceivably fast, so if Lafite revealed even the slightest opening, he would immediately receive a few more cuts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You should say this directly to my mom’s face! She will directly cut you.” Snow’s intelligence was even greater than its fighting strength, long discovering that the power of its words was even greater than its blades. As a result, while frantically attacking, its mouth didn’t stop at all. “Mom is yours? If she was, then where am I from? If you let my father hear this sentence, he’ll definitely kill you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Snow!” Curtis frowned, loudly shouting.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter saying this, even Snow felt that her attacks this time might have crossed some type of line. Lafite suddenly took a few steps back, his aura completely withdrawing, restraining all of his anger, anxiety, and flusteredness, becoming incomparably cool-headed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSnow’s body trembled, its body suddenly leaning down. Its stomach and back area began to vibrate at an extremely high frequency; this was its true combat state. It already sensed Lafite’s true killing intent and anger, its powerful sensation towards danger making its instincts revive, carrying out complete combat preparations. Moreover, Lafite’s power and killing intent were just that oppressive, to the extent where it couldn’t control itself, about to unleash a full powered attack first!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurtis suddenly stood up, blocking between Snow and Lafite, shouting with an heavy voice, “Lafite!

He stretched out his head, stared at Snow, and then said coldly, “Who is your father?

If you want to fight with him, then you have to step over me here first!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Lafite!” When he saw Lafite’s silver hair starting to burn, Curtis’ voice was already like thunder.

She suddenly stood up, and then when she rushed out from the room, she grabbed a pistol along the way, even though she knew that this gun was nothing more than a toy, unable to display any effects.
