I decide then that I will leave and prove a point; that despite the fact that he is telling the truth, I don’t have to listen to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly rising from the chair, he reaches over the table and seizes my wrist. Bringing my hand to the table, he traps it there beneath his. “Listen, I’m not much of a people person, so sometimes I say things that come off as…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you being an asshole.” I’m angry, irritated, as well as extremely hot and bothered by his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s one way to put it.” He smiles, but then it fades into a frown. “But, if you’ll let me, I swear to God, I’ll be nice. In fact, I promise I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at his hand on my arm and his fingers cup around my wrist. “People make empty promises all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never promise anything unless I mean it.” He loosens his grip and shifts the position of his hand so it’s extended over the table. “So, I’m promising you that I’ll be nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mull it over and then put my hand in his, feeling as though I’m betraying my self-worth, but it’s worth it just to get some peace for the rest of my time here. As soon as our skin comes into contact, it’s like my mind has been sucked into a pressurized bottle and my brain torrents with vivid images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex presses his hand to mine and there is a river of blood streaming down his forearm. “I promise I’ll never let anything happen to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forever?” I ask, my hand trembling against his as warm blood spills down my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles. “I promise.” He leans over the small box situated between us and the candles burn luminously from inside the dirt cave. “And I never promise anything unless I mean it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I look into his eyes, I only see truth and when he kisses me, pressing his lips to mine, devouring me, tasting me and feeling me with his free hand; I know that he’s all I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp, jerking my hand away as my heart squeezes inside my chest. “Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe calmly draws his hand away and rests it on the table. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah…” I take a deep breath, my pulse frantically pounding against the outpouring of adrenaline in my body. I search his eyes, looking for a sign that he experienced the same thing. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.” He reaches toward a stack of books on the table. “Maybe we should get to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is happening to me? These things… these images… what are they? I press down everything I’m feeling, the perplexity, fear, the longing, and I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ask you one more question?” he asks as I flick the cap off my pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, distracted by my thoughts. “Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you really get the scar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at the thin line running across my palm. “I have no idea… I can’t remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t seem alarmed by my answer, instead, he appears satisfied. He begins highlighting notes with a bright yellow marker and I do the same. Finally, after searching through an entire stack of books and finding nothing, I decide to go look for more in the Astronomy Section and see if I can find anything on Gamma-ray burst. Alex doesn’t ask where I’m going because he’s caught up in flirting with Blondie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m squatting down searching the slim selection of books on the bottom row, when someone walks up behind me. Electricity gyrates through me and I know its Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finding anything useful?” Alex asks, flopping down on the floor next to me with his back up against the shelf. “Because the stack on the table Aislin dug up is practically useless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide a book out from the shelf and shake my head. “The selection here’s crap. We might have to go to the library across town.” I turn around and sit down on the floor. “They have a better selection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or we could just bail on the project all together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you even in the class?” I open the book, turn around, and sit down on the floor. “If you don’t like the subject. It’s not even required.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grins. “An easy A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that easy,” I assure him as I skim through the chapter titles. “Take this project, which is turning out to be a pain in the ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why are you taking the class?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just love the stars, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure that’s it?” he questions with assumption in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to stay calm, but the fact that he’s assuming stuff about me makes me uneasy. What if he knows about my weird connection with the stars—how would he know? “No, that’s it. Just a love for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips part and there\u0027s a strange look on his face as he leans in. “I think I need to…” The blond-haired girl comes strutting up the aisle, swinging her hips, and he trails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, looks like you have a stalker,” I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile takes over his face. “Jealous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers drift to the back of my neck, which is free from the prickle and any new emotions. “I can one-hundred percent assure you that I’m not jealous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finds me perplexing as he studies me, but then the blond girl stops in front of us, and all his attention goes to her and her cleavage bursting from her top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I forgot to give you my number,” she says and holds out a torn piece of notebook paper with a number scribbled on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex reads it over and the girl waits with her bottom lip in her teeth and her arms crossed. When he doesn’t say anything, she asks, “So you’re going to call me, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex’s eyes scale up her body to her face. “Absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles and then shoots me a dirty look before walking away. When she disappears around the corner of the aisle, Alex balls up the paper and chucks it into the shelves across from us. I give him a funny look and he simply shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asks. “I’m not interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you just told her you would call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs again and then absorbs himself in a book. “Don’t pretend you’re not glad I just threw that away,” he says without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my finger down the page, trying to act uninterested, but there’s no use trying to deny it. He laughs softly under his breath and then silence settles between us as we read through pages and pages of book after book. Somehow Alex begins to shift toward me and I don’t notice until there’s only a whisper of air between our bodies. I should ask him to scoot over, but I don’t really want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoots over more until his shoulder magnetizes to mine. I freeze as my skin ignites and combusts like a flare, sending my body into a shuddering fit. Alex stiffens, but doesn’t move. I slant my head toward him our eyes locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once upon a time there was a princess,” a small boy smiles as he walks through the grass with a little girl. “And she was the most beautiful princess in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was she smart?” the girl asks, spinning in circles with her hands out to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was the smartest girl in the world,” the boy says and grabs her hand to stop her from spinning. “And the strongest, but she didn’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink the image of the children away, move back from Alex, and inhale sharply. What is that? And why has it only ever happened with Alex?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Alex’s eyes examine me over like he’s hunting for broken pieces hidden inside me. “You look pale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI allow my hair to create a veil between us as my head tips forward. “I’m fine. I just have a headache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, turn the page, and lean to the side to get away from the sweltering heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex releases out a slow breath, then tosses the book on the shelf and gets to his feet. “I think I’m going to bail out early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t look at him. “Okay.” Yes, gorgeous, beautiful guy, bail out. Bail out now. Run away from me before you find out just how crazy I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts to walk away, but dithers at the end of the aisle. “You’re absolutely sure you’re okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaves me alone with a stack of books. I sit there reading through them, trying to pretend like I’m fine. That nothing is wrong. That I’m completely normal. But I’m only lying to myself. Things are far from normal—they aren’t even close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLofty trees enclose around me. It’s dark. The moon is an orb that makes the mountains look like rolling shadows and the snow is a sheet of crystal. A light radiates brightly in the distance as I hike through the forest, heading deeper into the trees, moving for it, my mind begging me to get closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I step through the last of the bushes and out into the open, the light glows resolutely, like the stars above my head. I want to touch it–need to touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t touch it,” a deep voice that I know very well rises over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around to face it. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s resting against a tree with his arms folded and he’s dressed in dark jeans and a long-sleeve, black shirt. The radiance of the moon illuminates his face, making his eyes sparkle. “Because you don’t want to. Trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re standing out in the middle of the woods at night,” I reply. “That doesn’t scream trustworthy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn amused smile tugs at his lips as he stands up straight. “I followed you out here.” He walks toward me, narrowing the gap between us. “I thought I told you to wait inside the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance behind me at the light in the center of the snow, which has faded into a weak glimmer. “What is that?” Right as I say it, the light suffocates out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex stops inches away from me and the warmth of his breath brushes my chilled cheeks. “Gemma, you shouldn’t be wandering around out in the woods by yourself. It’s dangerous.” He leans in a little as he says it and our lips almost touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just a forest,” I say, breathless, and then joke, “I’m pretty sure all the bears are in hibernation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets out a soft laugh. “That’s not what I’m talking about.” He places a hand on my upper arm and lets out a sigh. “We should go back to the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move forward and graze my lips across his. “What if I don’t want to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection of our mouths causes a zap of static to erupt and I let out a soft moan. His body tenses, but his warm tongue willingly enters my mouth. He tastes like mint and it melts me on the inside as his hands slip up the sides of my neck to my cheeks and then up to my hair. He pulls at the roots, tipping my head back so he can search my mouth more thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You feel so good,” he murmurs against my lips as his hands slide around to my back and he pulls me closer. “So fucking good.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-promises-shattered-promises-1/page-6.html","bookId":1976,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:09 AM"}
