She straightway ascended to ask Jove to restore him; but before this could be done a Sculptor and a Critic passed that way and espied him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“This is a very bad Apollo,” said the Sculptor: “the chest is too narrow, and one arm is at least a half-inch shorter than the other.
