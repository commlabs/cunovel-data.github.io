She sometimes overcooked it, and that would ruin everything. This dinner was special—she was cooking for Bobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she’d been married for more than two weeks, it was the first meal she’d put together for her husband. Bobby was flying in from someplace in Russia following an important match. She’d had no idea the demands on his time would be this constant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he was faithful about phoning each and every day, and often more than that, Bobby hadn’t contacted her when he’d finished this match. As far as Teri could figure, Bobby was on a plane. He’d caught a flight immediately after the competition and was landing in Seattle at five. James was with him and would drive him from Sea-Tac to Cedar Cove—to their home. Yes, they had a real home now, at 74 Seaside Avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin days of her return from Las Vegas, Teri had purchased the house. Bobby insisted she move out of her apartment and into a place big enough for both of them. He’d written the check, and she’d moved in so quickly that her head was still spinning. She’d learned that when Bobby Polgar wanted something done, it got done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d given her a credit card, which she’d used to buy new furniture from a high-class Seattle shop, including a leather sofa, the price of which shocked her, and a solid-wood dining suite. And then there was the bed….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEager to show her husband the house and cook for him, Teri had decided to make one of her favorite meals. The macaroni-and-cheese dish was a hit whenever she brought it to the Christmas potluck at work. She had a couple of variations on it, too. Sometimes she added cooked taco meat, which was just hamburger and taco seasonings. Occasionally she threw in some chopped tomatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri wanted Bobby to like her cooking. When he’d taken her out for dinner, or—more frequently—ordered room service, they’d always had fancy food, lobster and such. She thought he’d enjoy some more basic fare. Her kind of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed strange but they’d been apart longer than they’d been married. She needed her husband, missed being with him and, yes, sleeping with him. Although the truth was, neither of them seemed too interested in sleep. She smiled, recalling how much Bobby seemed to enjoy the marriage bed. Well, it’d mostly been hotel beds, but that wasn’t the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeering out the window, she saw the stretch limo pull up in front of the house. Too excited to wait a second longer, Teri dashed out the door. Bobby hadn’t even taken two steps toward her when she hurled herself into his arms. The impact nearly knocked him off his feet. If not for the fact that the vehicle was directly behind him, Bobby would’ve keeled straight over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri spread eager kisses across his face, setting his glasses askew. She quickly realized he wasn’t nearly as enthusiastic as he normally was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bobby?” she asked, leaning back to get a good look at him. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer right away. In fact, it was James who explained in hushed tones. “You didn’t hear?” he asked. “Bobby lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, those things happened. He couldn’t possibly win every time. You win some and you lose some; that was her philosophy of life. In Bobby’s case, he won more often than he lost because he was so darned good at what he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t like to lose, Miss Teri,” James explained further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one enjoys losing,” she said calmly. “Does this mean our entire visit is ruined?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t lose often,” James continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby didn’t even seem to be listening. James dragged his suitcase into the house and placed it just inside the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid he’s taken the defeat hard,” James said in a low voice as he walked past her on his return to the limo. “He needs a bit of TLC, and he’ll be fine. I’ll be back to pick him up in two days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling her husband gently by the hand, Teri led him into the house. “Let me give you a tour,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be in some kind of trance. “Bobby, are you listening?” She waved her fingers in front of his face with no result. Instead he walked over to the chessboard she’d set up on a small oak table and sat down. She’d studied a diagram to position the pieces correctly. Without a word, he started moving them around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri could see it would do no good to interrupt him with a little thing like…life. His concentration was so complete that he didn’t seem to be aware of where he was or that she was with him. Rather than pouting or making a fuss, Teri dished up a bowl of her specialty macaroni and cheese, squirted on some ketchup and sat cross-legged on the carpet beside him to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, Bobby glanced up, apparently shocked to find her there. “Teri?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Bobby. Welcome home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down on the sofa next to him and brushed his hair aside. “I heard,” she said tenderly. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like to lose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo kidding. “Did you figure out what went wrong?” she asked, looking over the chessboard and the pieces he had scattered about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer question resulted in a furrowed brow, as if he wasn’t sure how to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind, I’ll get you a dish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could wait,” he said, and his eyes held hers for the longest moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri might not have been married long but she knew that look. “Perhaps you’d like to see the rest of the house,” she suggested. “Shall we begin with the master bedroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since he’d arrived, Bobby smiled. He trotted down the hallway behind her and into the bedroom. Then he shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, Teri lay next to him in bed, sighing with contentment. Bobby held her close. “Losing doesn’t seem so bad when I hold you,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. I’m glad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hungry now,” he said and, as if to prove his point, his stomach growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be,” she said, kissing his jaw. “That was quite a workout I gave you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby smiled again, and Teri wondered how many people in this world had actually seen her husband do that. Not many, she suspected. She climbed out of bed and got her robe, slipping her arms into the sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like the house?” she asked, tying her sash. She’d felt a bit anxious about that, since she’d made the decision without Bobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up and grinned. “Very much. Especially the bedroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri swatted his shoulder playfully. “Come on, husband of mine, and I’ll serve you my specialty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head to one side, and gazed up at her, his expression intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bobby?” She wasn’t sure what he was thinking when he stared at her like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep frown wrinkled his brow and the perplexed look gradually turned into one of pleasure—and wonderment. “I love you,” he said simply. “I really love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned over and kissed him softly on the lips. “I love you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir time together was brief, too brief to suit Teri. They had three nights and two full days. Every evening she cooked for him. He enjoyed her macaroni and cheese, and her chili pie, another dish she’d invented, and her broccoli quiche, which she’d made using a recipe she’d cut out from the Chronicle. They listened to music and she taught him how to play Yahtzee and strip poker. He preferred the poker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked the fact that he didn’t yet know anyone in Cedar Cove. She’d taken Saturday off, so they had the whole weekend, during which they saw only each other—no friends or neighbors. Teri didn’t even answer her phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for the five days they’d spent on their honeymoon, they’d had almost no time together. Those days in Vegas weren’t a true indication of what life with Bobby would be like. Now that he was home, she’d been surprised by how little he actually slept. He’d told her once that he spent a lot of time thinking, and that had been no exaggeration. He required four hours or less of sleep a night. Often she found him sitting in the living room in front of the chessboard, studying it intently, working out moves in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes he seemed to forget she was with him. Terri didn’t take offense at his lack of attention. Because when he did remember, he made her feel more cherished and loved than she’d ever felt in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he said he loved her, he meant it. Loving someone seemed to be a new experience for Bobby, and it was important to him that she know how strong his feelings were. Every day they were together he bought her gifts, ordering them by phone or Internet, and no doubt paying a premium for quick delivery. These weren’t minor gifts, either. The first day it was a diamond tennis bracelet and a tennis racket to go with it. Teri had never played tennis in her life. Bobby, however, believed the two were supposed to go together and she wasn’t about to disillusion him. The following day it was a wall-mounted plasma-screen television with satellite hookup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen James arrived, Teri had to swallow the words to ask her husband to stay a few extra days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby held her and then kissed her. She kissed him back. “When will I see you again?” she asked, thinking any more than a few hours would be too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained his travel schedule, the upcoming matches. His answer was lengthy, technical and confusing. She looked to James for a translation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can last a week,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby smiled and hugged her a final time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take care of him,” she told James, her hand lingering on her husband’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will.” He opened the car door for Bobby, who reluctantly climbed in the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolding her arms, Teri stepped away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did a great job,” the chauffeur said under his breath as he walked around the limo. “I’ve only known Bobby to lose one other match in all the years I’ve worked for him. Afterward, he sank into a depression that lasted for months.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be all right now,” she assured the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames touched the rim of his cap. “You’re good for him, Miss Teri.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she didn’t tell James was that Bobby was good for her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette had waited for this moment ever since she’d heard Cal was back from Wyoming. After a week, he’d phoned and asked if they could meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had restrained herself from calling him, and the fact that he’d taken so long to get in touch only compounded the pain. Hoping to put them both at ease, she’d suggested the waterfront park. It was neutral territory, and in the early afternoon, there were few occupants besides the seagulls. On Thursday evenings during the summer, the park held Concerts on the Cove, with free entertainment ranging from rock-and-roll groups to folk singers and swing bands. Linnette hadn’t yet attended a single one, although she knew her parents enjoyed the outings. It didn’t strike her as something that would appeal to her father, but he went, primarily to please her mother. It was their once-a-week summer date. If it wasn’t so ironic, it would be laughable. Her married parents dated more often than she did. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/6-rainier-drive-cedar-cove-6/page-47.html","bookId":1947,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM"}
