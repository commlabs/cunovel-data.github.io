This was the first time he’d come home to his territory. Earth to sky and every person, tree, and rock in between belonged to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria appeared at his side. “Is that the compound?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry shifted the bow and quiver on his back, covering his surprise. On their return, she’d paid him no more attention than she had Reef, who wouldn’t look at her, or Gren and Twig, who couldn’t stop staring. They’d slept across the fire from each other at night, and had hardly spoken during the days. When they had spoken, their exchanges had felt brief and cold. He hated pretending around her, but if it helped her feel comfortable coming back with him, he’d go along with it. For now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right there,” he said, nodding. Rain had threatened all day, and now a light drizzle began to fall. He wished the clouds would part to show the sun or the Aether—any light at all—but the sky had been overcast for days. “My father had it built in a circle—easier to defend. We have wooden walls that draw closed between the houses during raids. The highest structure … See the roof over there?” He pointed. “That’s the cookhouse. The heart of the tribe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry paused as Twig and Gren passed them. He’d sent Reef ahead that morning to make an announcement to the Tides, letting everyone know that Aria was under his protection as an ally. He wanted her arrival to go as smoothly as possible. With Twig and Gren pulling ahead, he let himself step closer to her and nodded toward the burnt stretch of land to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An Aether storm tore right through those woods in the winter. It took out part of our best farmland.” A small shudder rolled through his shoulders as her temper hit him. Bright green, a scent like mint. She was alert and a little skitty with nerves. He’d forgotten what it felt like to be rendered to another person, to not only scent their tempers but feel them himself. Aria didn’t know this bond existed between them. He hadn’t told her in the fall, having thought then that he’d never see her again, but he’d do it soon, when he got her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The damage could’ve been worse, though,” he continued. “We kept the fires from spreading, and the compound wasn’t hit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her as she studied the horizon. The Tide Valley wasn’t a large territory, but it was fertile, near the sea, and well positioned for defense. Could she see that? It was good land when the Aether left it alone. He didn’t know how much longer that would be. Another year? Two, at the most, before it became nothing but scorched earth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s much prettier than I imagined,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out his breath, relieved. “Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria looked at him, her eyes smiling. “Yeah.” She turned away, and Perry wondered if they’d been standing too close. Couldn’t they talk if they were pretending to be allies? Was a smile too much? Then he saw what she’d heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillow charged toward them at full speed on the dirt path, Flea galloping at her side. The dog thundered up first, laying back his ears and baring his teeth at Aria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right,” Perry said. “He’s friendly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stood her ground and rolled on the balls of her feet, ready to move quickly. “He doesn’t look it,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar had told him she’d become a skilled fighter in the past months. Perry saw the difference now. She looked stronger, quicker. More comfortable with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTearing his eyes away from her, he knelt. “Here, Flea. Give her some space.” Flea inched forward and sniffed Aria’s boots, his tail wagging slowly, before he pranced over. Perry scratched his wiry coat, a patchwork of brown and black fur. “He’s Willow’s dog. You’ll never see them apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I guess this is Willow,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry straightened in time to see Willow blow past Gren and Twig with a hasty greeting; then she jumped into his arms the same way she’d done since she was three. At thirteen she was getting too big for that, but it made him laugh, so Willow kept doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told me you’d only be a few days,” she said as soon as Perry set her down. She was in her usual outfit—dusty pants, dusty boots, dusty shirt, and red strips of fabric braided through her dark hair, made from pieces of the skirt her mother had sewn for her over the winter but that she’d taken apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry smiled. “It was only a few days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Felt like forever,” Willow said, and then she peered at Aria, her dark brown eyes suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’d first been cast out of Reverie, Aria had been hard to miss as a Dweller. She’d spoken in sharp, clipped sounds, her skin had been pale as milk, and her scent had been rancy and off. Those differences had faded away. She was noticeable for another reason now—the same reason Twig and Gren had stared at her for the past two days when she wasn’t looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roar told me a Dweller was coming,” Willow said finally. “He said I’d like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope he’s right,” Aria said, petting Flea on the head. The dog now sat against her leg, panting happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillow lifted her chin. “Well, Flea likes you, so maybe I will too.” She looked up at Perry, frowning, and he scented her temper. Usually it was a bright citrus scent, but now a dark tinge blurred into the edges of his vision, telling him something wasn’t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happened, Will?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I know is Bear and Wylan have been waiting for you, and they don’t look happy. I thought you’d want to know.” Willow’s narrow shoulders lifted in a shrug; then she sped off, with Flea loping beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry made for the compound, wondering what he’d find. Bear, a wall of a man with a gentle heart and hands permanently stained from working the earth, was lead on anything related to farming. Slight and surly, Wylan was the Tides’ head fisherman. The two bickered constantly about where the Tides’ resources belonged, in a never-ending battle between earth and sea. Perry hoped that it was nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria strode beside him with confidence as they passed through the main gates and stepped into the clearing at the center of the compound, but he scented the cool tone of her fear. He saw his home through her eyes then—a circle of cottages made of wood and stone and weathered by the salt air—and wondered again what she was thinking. It was nowhere as comfortable as Marron’s, and there’d be no comparison at all to what she was used to in the Pods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d arrived just before supper—unfortunate timing. Dozens of people milled around, waiting for the call to eat. Others stood at their windows and crowded their doors, watching with wide eyes. One of Gray’s boys pointed, while the other giggled at his side. Brooke rose from a bench in front of her house, looking from him to Aria and back. In a guilty flash, Perry remembered a conversation he’d had with her over the winter. He’d told Brooke they couldn’t be together because he had too much on his mind. That too much had been Aria—the girl who, at that time, he thought he’d never see again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, Bear and Wylan stood talking with Reef. They looked over, falling silent. Some instinct kept Perry moving toward his house. He’d deal with them soon enough. He didn’t see the one person whose help he could use right now: Roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry stopped before his door and nudged aside a basket of kindling with his foot. He looked at Aria standing beside him and felt like he should say something. Welcome? You’ll be safe here? Everything seemed too formal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s small,” he said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside, cringing as he saw blankets scattered across the floor and dirty mugs on the table. Clothes lay tossed in a pile in the corner, and a stack of books along the far wall had toppled over. The sea was half an hour away, but there was a dusting of sand on the floorboards beneath his feet. He supposed it could’ve looked worse for a house shared by half a dozen men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Six sleep here,” he explained. “I met them after you …” He couldn’t say left. He didn’t know why, but he couldn’t say the word. “They’re my guard now. Marked, all of them. You’ve met Reef, Twig, and Gren already. The rest are brothers: Hyde, Hayden, and Straggler. Seers, the three of them. Strag’s name is actually Haven, but … you’ll see. It suits him.” He rubbed his chin, forcing himself to shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a candle or a lamp?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did he notice the dimness. To him, the room’s lines were cut in sharp relief. To Aria—or anyone else—they’d be lost. He was always aware of being a Scire, but he forgot about his vision until times like this. He was a Seer, but the real power of his eyes was the keenness of his sight in darkness. Aria had once called it a mutation—an effect of the Aether that had warped his Sense more than others’. He thought of it more as a curse, a reminder of the Seer mother who’d died bringing him to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry opened the shutters, letting in the murky afternoon light. Outside, the clearing buzzed with gossip as news of Aria’s arrival spread. Nothing he could do about it. He crossed his arms, his stomach clenching, as he watched her absorb the space. He couldn’t believe she was there, in his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria came to the window beside him and studied Talon’s collection of carved falcons, which rested on the sill. Perry knew he needed to see Bear and Wylan, but he couldn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat. “Talon and I did those. His are the good ones. Mine is the one that looks like a turtle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked it up and turned it in her hand. Her gray eyes were warm as she looked up and said, “It’s my favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s gaze moved to her lips. They were alone. This was as close as they’d stood since she’d last been in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set the carving down and stepped away. “You’re sure I can stay here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. You can have the room.” From where he stood, he could see the edge of his brother’s bed, covered with a faded red blanket. He’d rather she not stay in there, but saw no better choice. “I sleep up there,” he said, tipping his head to the loft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria dropped her satchel against the wall and glanced at the front door, smiling at a sound beyond the reach of his ears. A second later, Roar blew into the house in a dark flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finally!” he bellowed. He wrapped Aria into a hug, lifting her off the ground. “What took you two so long? Don’t answer that.” He glanced at Perry. “I think I know.” He set her down and then clasped Perry’s hand. “Good you’re back, Per.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did I miss?” Perry asked, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Roar could answer, Wylan, Bear, and Reef arrived, crowding in as the house fell into a thick silence. They stood for a long moment, all eyes fixed on the only stranger among them. The tempers in the room sharpened, heating up and bleeding red into Perry’s vision. They didn’t want her there. He’d known they’d react this way, but his hands curled into fists anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Aria,” he said, fighting the urge to step toward her. “She’s half Dweller, as Reef’s told you. She’ll be helping us find the Still Blue, in exchange for shelter. While she’s here, she’ll be Marked as an Audile.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-3.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
