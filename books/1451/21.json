Especially in this critical moment, when the new authority of the workers and peasants is in process of consolidation, it is impossible to leave it in the hands of the enemy, at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs and machine-guns. This is why temporary and extraordinary measures have been adopted for the purpose of stopping the flow of filth and calumny in which the yellow and green press would be glad to drown the young victory of the people.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative measures against the press will be suspended; full liberty will be given it within the limits of responsibility before the law, in accordance with the broadest and most progressive regulations….\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bearing in mind, however, the fact that any restrictions of the freedom of the press, even in critical moments, are admissible only within the bounds of necessity, the Council of People’s Commissars decrees as follows:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1. The following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure: (a) Those inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government; (b) Those creating confusion by obviously and deliberately perverting the news; (c) Those inciting to acts of a criminal character punishable by the laws.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 2. The temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press shall be carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the Council of People’s Commissars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 3. The present decree is of a temporary nature, and will be revoked by a special ukaz when normal conditions of public life are re-established.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e President of the Council of People’s Commissars,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e VLADIMIR ULIANOV (LENIN).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On Workers’ Militia\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1. All Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies shall form a Workers’ Militia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 2. This Workers’ Militia shall be entirely at the orders of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 3. Military and civil authorities must render every assistance in arming the workers and in supplying them with technical equipment, even to the extent of requisitioning arms belonging to the War Department of the Government.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 4. This decree shall be promulgated by telegraph. Petrograd, November 10, 1917.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e People’s Commissar of the Interior\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A. I. RYKOV.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This decree encouraged the formation of companies of Red Guards all over Russia, which became the most valuable arm of the Soviet Government in the ensuing civil war.\n\u003cbr\u003e 2.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Strike Fund\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fund for the striking Government employees and bank clerks was subscribed by banks and business houses of Petrograd and other cities, and also by foreign corporations doing business in Russia. All who consented to strike against the Bolsheviki were paid full wages, and in some cases their pay was increased. It was the realisation of the strike fund contributors that the Bolsheviki were firmly in power, followed by their refusal to pay strike benefits, which finally broke the strike.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1364/40909.html","bookId":1451,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:29:46 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:29:46 AM"}
