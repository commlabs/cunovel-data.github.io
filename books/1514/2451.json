Back then, Little Marten was undoubtedly the most dazzling figure amongst his generation. At that time, Hao Jiuyou was merely a timid youth who followed behind him. Hence, no one expected that a hundred years later, this once unassuming young man, would become the greatest competitor to Little Marten for the position of tribe leader successor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, big brother Ah Diao.

However, the icy cold glint within his eyes intensified. He withdrew his fingers before his body rose directly into the sky.
