This might be Oren Tenning lying in this bed, but the Ten part of him was completely gone. And it had been the Ten part I’d fallen in love with. My perfect Ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered and squeezed Noel’s hand harder. He glanced down at me, his eyes lit with the same worry. His Ten, his best friend, was also gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason introduced himself next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you call me Buttercup.” Reese waved at him with a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “We shared an art class last year, and had some good times annoying the hell out of each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren blinked back a confused frown, probably trying to figure out how annoying each other could be considered good times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve probably known you the shortest amount of time,” Asher said. “My first name’s Asher, but you usually call me by my last, which is Hart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed so bizarre that we had to introduce ourselves to him. I wanted to escape this room, I wanted to escape this moment. Oren couldn’t forget us. He just couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like I nicknamed a lot of people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You definitely do the nickname thing,” Quinn said. “My first name’s Quinn, but you’ve always called me Ham. And Noel is usually Gam to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren nodded and glanced up at me before turning his gaze to Noel. “So, what did I nickname your wife?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Sympathy rushed through Noel’s gaze as he glanced at me. “No. This is actually my sister. Caroline.” He paused briefly, as if waiting to see if that name meant anything to him, but he didn’t even flinch, which totally made me flinch inside. “My wife Aspen’s at home with my younger brothers. But you call her Shakespeare, because she’s an English teacher.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Sorry.” Oren glanced at me, apologizing for mistaking me as Noel’s wife. He started to look away again, but then did a double take. Recognition lit his gaze, and I held my breath, yearning, praying he remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think everyone else in the room leaned in as well, holding a collective breath as they hoped for the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at me. “You were the nurse in here yesterday, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a pained breath and pulled back, trying not to lose it. Noel squeezed my elbow hard, so I blinked rapidly and nodded. “Y-yes. That was me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked between me and Noel before murmuring, “Oh. Okay, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t going to make it. I needed to curl into a ball and weep somewhere. Soon. I caught Zoey’s eyes and her face dissolved into misery. She had to bury her face in Quinn’s shoulder to hide her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my chin to hold strong, but I don’t know how I made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a breaking point for everyone, it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should probably let you rest,” Asher murmured, looking as sad as I’d ever seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Oren, on the other hand, appeared relieved to see us go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel tugged me against him hard, knowing how close to the edge I was. We all glanced toward the door, but then Eva muttered, “Damn it. I know you don’t remember me, but I’m going to hug you goodbye, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh...” Oren pulled back, his eyes going wide as she stalked toward him with a determined arch in her eyebrows. Then he said, “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched enviously as Eva wrapped her arms around him and hugged him. He even hugged her back with one arm. Then she stamped a quick kiss to his cheek. I longed so hard to go to him, too, to melt into his arms and just hold the love of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReese glanced at me, winked, and then darted away from Mason. “Well, I want a hug, too, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, she hugged him, and he let her, giving her another one-armed hug back. When she pulled away, she looked directly at me. “Next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey reached out and nudged me forward. I stumbled, but caught my feet and lifted my gaze. Oren watched me, letting me step toward him without protest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-173.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
