A foreigner, the skin of his forearms a swirl of arcane tattoos, the rest of his upper body wrapped in a roughly woven cape, the hood hiding his features. Barbaric, wary, the glitter of eyes taking it all in, pausing halfway down to hawk and spit over the side, a gesture that startled the Errant and, it seemed, most of those standing on the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later another foreigner rose into view, pausing at the top of the gangway. The Errant’s breath caught, a sudden chill flowing through him, as if Hood himself had arrived, his cold breath whispering across the back of the god’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbyss take me, all that waits within him. The foment none other here can see, could even guess at. Dear son of Gothos and that overgrown hag, the stain of Azath blood is about you like a cloud. This was more than a curse-all that afflicted this fell warrior. Deliberate skeins were woven about him, the threads of some elaborate, ancient, and deadly ritual. And he knew their flavour. The Nameless Ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo soldiers from Triban Gnol’s Palace Guard moved to await the Jhag as he slowly walked down to the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant’s heart was thudding hard in his chest. They have delivered a champion, a challenger to the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jhag stepped onto solid ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the buildings beyond the harbour front, birds rose suddenly, hundreds, then thousands, voicing a chorus of shrieks, and beneath the Errant’s feet the stones shifted with a heavy, groaning sound. Something large collapsed far into the city, beyond Quillas Canal, and distant screams followed. The Errant stepped out from the wall and saw the bloom of a dust cloud rising behind the caterwauling, panicked pigeons, rooks, gulls and starlings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subterranean groaning then ceased and a heavy silence settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium’s tusked mouth revealed the faintest of smiles, as if pleased with the earth’s welcome, and the Errant could not be sure-at this distance-if that smile was truly as childlike as it seemed, or if it was in fact ironic or, indeed, bitter. He repressed the urge to draw closer seeking an answer to that question, reminding himself that he did not want Icarium’s attention. Not now, not ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomad Sengar, what your son will face…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no wonder, he suddenly realized, that all that was to come was obscured in a maelstrom of chaos. They have brought Icarium… into the heart of my power.,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the delegation and other Letherii nearby, it was clear that no particular connection had been made between Icarium’s first touch on solid ground and the minor earthquake rumbling through Letheras-yet such stirrings were virtually unknown for this region, and while the terror among the birds and the bawling of various beasts of burden continued unabated, already the consternation of those within the Errant’s sight was diminishing. Foolish mortals, so quick to disregard unease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the river beyond, the water slowly lost its shivering agitation and the gulls further but began to settle once again amidst yet more ships angling towards shore. Yet somewhere in the city, a building had toppled, probably some venerable ancient edifice, its foundations weakened by groundwater, its mortar crumbled and supports rotted through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would have been casualties-Icarium’s first, but most assuredly not his last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill cursing, Taralack Veed turned to Yan Tovis. ‘Unsettled lands-Burn does not rest easy here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Atri-Preda shrugged to hide her queasy shock. ‘To the north of here, along the Reach Mountains, the ground shakes often. The same can be said for the north side of the ranges to the far south, the other side of the Draconean Sea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the glimmer of bared teeth in the hood’s shadow. ‘But not in Letheras, yes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ve not heard of such before, but that means little,’ she replied. ‘This city is not my home. Not where I was born. Not where I grew up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed edged closer, facing away from Icarium, who stood listening to the two palace guards as they instructed him in what was to come. ‘You fool,’ he hissed at her. ‘Burn’s flesh flinched, Twilight. Flinched-because of him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gral cocked his head, and she could feel his contempt. ‘What happens now?’ he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now? Very little. There are secure residences, for you and your champion. As for when the Emperor chooses to face his challengers, that is up to him. Sometimes, he is impatient and the clash occurs immediately. Other times, he waits, often for weeks. But I will tell you what will begin immediately.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The burial urn for Icarium, and his place in the cemetery where resides every challenger Rhulad has faced.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-83.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
