He had cast a number of divinations and was doing his damnedest to follow them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of your spells are working,\" Quenthel asked, \"are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun didn\u0027t bother looking at her but continued along the corridor hoping he would stumble on something that might getthem on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting . . . contradictory information,\" he shot back, \"but at least I\u0027m doing something. You said you\u0027ve been here before-why aren\u0027t you taking us right to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel didn\u0027t answer, and they shared a look that served as an agreement not to continue bickering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s as if the farther we go into this spider fortress, the stranger our surroundings become,\" Danifae said. \"There were no right angles anywhere when we first walked in, but now there are. They seemed to appear the moment I got comfortable wandering the corridors without them. Still, we have seen nothing alive, haven\u0027t been harried by a single guardian, and for all intents and purposes we have the run of the place. What does it mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Lolth wanted us to come,\" Quenthel replied, shooting a contemptuous glance at Danifae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun and Valas exchanged a look that told each other they\u0027d reached very different conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard paused in a section of corridor that had widened out to well over twenty feet. The ceiling was low, the darkness comfortably dense, and the smell of rot fortunately not as overwhelming as it had been most of the time. He cast another spell and concentrated on his surroundings, searching for signs of life. He could sense dead spots through which his magic couldn\u0027t penetrate-walls perhaps lined with lead or some other particularly dense substance. Still, far at the edge of the limits of his perception, Pharaun could make out signs of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A light wash,\" he whispered to himself, \"but it\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Quenthel asked. \"What\u0027s there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard opened his eyes and smiled at Quenthel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something alive in here with us after all,\" he said, \"but the sign is strange-diffuse and distant as if the creature is either very far away, only barely alive, cloaked in magic that protects it from divination, or some combination of those things. I can\u0027t get a . . . Mistress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel dropped to her knees, and Pharaun instinctively backed away. The air was charged, and the Master of Sorcere\u0027s skin tingled, but whatever was happening had a much more profound effect on the two females.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel dropped to her hands, her face coming dangerous inches from smashing into the cold, rusted steel of the ruined spider fortress. Her muscles jerked and spasmed, and her face was twisted into either a rictus of agonized pain or a grin of some kind of feral pleasure- Pharaun couldn\u0027t tell which.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae fell to the floor as well, but she was facing up. Her back arched, and soon she was touching the floor only from one tiny spot on her head and the tips of her toes. Pharaun couldn\u0027t help admiring the curve of her body, marred as it was by the same petty wounds-cuts, abrasions, welts, and bruises-that they\u0027d all accumulated along the way. Not sure he wasn\u0027t seeing only what he wanted to see, Pharaun thought Danifae\u0027s expression was one of total pleasure, complete physical abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext it was Jeggred\u0027s turn to fall. The draegloth dropped to one knee, his three remaining hands reaching out to grab blindly at the walls. He ripped jagged rents in one steel partition. Brown dust covered his fur, clinging to it in clumps until it looked like the half-demon was rusting the same as the spider fortress. Jeggred screamed so loudly Pharaun had to clamp his hands over his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the draegloth\u0027s scream faded into panting-desperate gasps for air-Pharaun looked at Valas. The scout seemed entirely unaffected, and Pharaun himself felt no burning desire to writhe around on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever it is,\" Pharaun said to the scout, \"it only seems to be affecting the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought at first that he was going to say \"the females,\" then he realized that it was affecting the priestesses and the one creature among them born of Lolth\u0027s peculiar hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ended as abruptly as it began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred, who had been the one least affected by the sudden rapture, was the first to stand and begin to brush himself off. His face-normally difficult to read-gave Pharaun nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" the wizard asked, but the draegloth ignored him. \"Jeggred?\" Quenthel sat back on her haunches and held her hands up to her face. Her eyes scoured her rust-dusted hands as if searching for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae took longer to recover, rolling into a fetal position on the unforgiving rusted steel floor and making a noise Pharaun at first thought was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mistress?\" Valas asked, crouching to get to Quenthel\u0027s eye level but not stepping any closer than the half dozen paces that already separated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel didn\u0027t speak, didn\u0027t even give any indication that she had heard Valas. Pharaun didn\u0027t bother asking what happened. He was beginning to understand what he\u0027d witnessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel began to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she moved her lips in a mute pantomime, then she whispered at the edge of hearing, then she chanted a litany in an ancient tongue not even Pharaun recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued for a minute or so then stopped. Pharaun\u0027s eyes played over her, and he watched as all the cuts and bruises, scrapes and welts faded away, leaving her skin a perfect, almost glowing black. She even seemed to gain back some of the weight she\u0027d lost. Her hair appeared cleaner, softer, and even her piwafwi and armor shone with renewed life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel Baenre stood and looked down at Danifae, who had uncurled herself to sit with her back to the wall, smiling as she whispered a prayer of her own that sealed her cuts, made her bruises disappear, and brought the twinkle back into her big, expressive eyes. A tear traced a path down one of her perfect ebony cheeks, and she didn\u0027t bother to wipe it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun looked back at the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, who stood tall and still in the darkness of the spider fortress, seeming to glow. Her eyes were closed and her lipswere moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one fluid, graceful motion Danifaeswept up to her feet, her perfect white teeth shining in the gloom as she grinned from ear to ear. Pharaun found himself returning that smile. Jeggred rolled up onto his feet but in the same movement sank down to his knees in front of Danifae and Quenthel. The draegloth was breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are alive, and they\u0027re here,\" Quenthel whispered. She looked at Pharaun and more clearly said, \"They are behind walls that shield them from your spells, and they are further protected from most divinations, but they are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Valas asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sense them too,\" Danifae said. She put a hand on Jeggred\u0027s wild mane and absently stroked it back into place. \"I think I could find them. I think they\u0027re actually waiting for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Pharaun said, stepping closer to Danifae-until a fierce growl from Jeggred stopped him. The young priestess patted the half-demon\u0027s head, and he calmed quickly. \"Did what I think happened actually happen? Did she . . . ?\" \"Lolth has returned to us,\" Quenthel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has,\" Danifae agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared as if she wanted to say more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something else?\" Pharaun asked. \"Is that it? Is our journey at an end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mistress?\" Jeggred said, looking directly into Danifae\u0027s eyes. \"What did the voice say? I couldn\u0027t quite ... it was too far away to ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae ran her fingers through his fur and said, \"The voice said-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yor\u0027thae,\" Quenthel finished for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yor\u0027thae. . . .\" Danifae whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"High Drow?\" Valas asked, correctly identifying the language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means, \u0027Chosen One,\u0027 \" Pharaun explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One . . .\" Quenthel whispered, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Danifae mutely mouthed the word, \"Yor\u0027thae.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel used her eyes to get Pharaun\u0027s attention then said, \"Our journey is far from over, Master of Sorcere. Lolthhas not only returned but she has asked me to come to her, has invited me to be her chosen vessel. This is why she brought me back, all those years ago. This is why she dragged me from the Abyss and back to Menzoberranzan. I was meant to come here, now, and to be her ... to be Yor\u0027thae.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep in the heart of the First House, in a room protected from everything worth protecting a room from, Triel Baenre watched her brother fight for the life of Menzoberranzan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was losing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see what was happening in the Bazaar, every detail of it, through a magic mirror, a crystal ball, a scrying pool, and half a dozen other similar items, most of which had been created by Gromph himself. She paced back and forth across the polished marble floor, looking from scene to scene, angle to angle, as the transformed lichdrow made a mess of the heart of her city. Wilara Baenre stood in one corner, her eyes darting from one scrying device to another, her arms crossed in front of her, her fingers drumming against her shoulders with barely contained frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The archmage will prevail, Matron Mother,\" Wilara said, not for the first time that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he?\" Triel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time she\u0027d replied to one of Wilara\u0027s hollow reassurances, and it took the attending priestess by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he will,\" Wilara answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel waited for more, but it became obvious that Wilara had nothing else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not entirely certain that this is a fight he can win,\" Triel said, as much to herself as to Wilara. \"If we\u0027re all being tested and this is Gromph\u0027s test, he will pass or fail on his own. If he fails, he deserves to die.\" \"Is there nothing we can do to help him?\" asked Wilara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are soldiers and other mages,\" the attending priestess went on. \"All of whom are required elsewhere. The duergar still press, even if the tanarukks are turning away,\" said Triel. \"The siege of Agrach Dyrr goes on unabated . . . but, yes, there are always more soldiers, always more mages, and there is Bregan D\u0027aerthe and other mercenaries. If the lich kills Gromph I certainly won\u0027t let him rampage through the rest of Menzoberranzan turning our citizens to stone and smashing the architecture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not send those forces in now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel shrugged again and considered the question. She had no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Triel said finally. \"Maybe I\u0027m waiting for a sign from-\" She was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel fell to the floor, her body going limp, her head spinning, her mind exploding in a cacophony of sound and shadow, voices and screams. Tears welled up in her eyes so she could only barely see Wilara lying in a similar confused, twitching, limp state on the floor across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Matron Mother of House Baenre felt every emotion she\u0027d ever known simultaneously and at their sharpest and most intense. She hated and loved, feared and cherished, laughed and cried. She knew the endless expanse of the limitless multiverse and saw in crystal detail the square inch of marble floor right in front of her eye. She was in her scrying chamber and in the Demonweb Pits, in her mother\u0027s womb and in the smoldering Bazaar, in the deepest Underdark and flying through the blazing skies of the World Above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, and one feeling after another fell away, each a layer of confusion and insanity. Pieces of her mind began to function again, then pieces of her body. It took either a few minutes or a few years-Triel couldn\u0027t be sure how long-for her to realize what had happened and sort through the sensation that had been so familiar all her life, then was gone, then returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the fickle grace of the Queen of the Demonweb Pits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel didn\u0027t try to stand at first but lay there and stretched, luxuriating in the wash of power, exulting in the return of Lolth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph knew of so manyways to kill someone, he\u0027d forgotten more than most drow ever heard of. There were spells that would kill with a touch, kill with a word, kill with a thought, and Gromph searched his mind for precisely the right one as he ran to both avoid the rampaging gigant and keep it contained in the ruined Bazaar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore the skull sapphire that gave him even more choices and afforded him protection from negative energy-like Nimor\u0027s enervating breath. In his memory he stored a few more, and in time Gromph settled on one spell, with some input from Nauzhror and the small circle of Sorcere necromancers. The archmage gathered the Weave energy within him and brought the words and gestures of the incantation to mind. However, in order to cast the spell-and it was a powerful spell indeed-the archmage would have to stop running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the first time that the battle with Dyrr came down to timing. Would he have enough time to cast the spell before the gigant rolled over him? We can help you choose your moment, Nauzhror said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, Gromph answered, but there are always. . . variables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage stopped running, turned, and began his casting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gigant looked down at him, bathing Gromph in the light from its mad blue eyes. Gromph was sure he had time. The animated, petrified drow were too far away and moving too slowly to be of any concern, and the gigant had been slapping its tail around the Bazaar at random, as if Dyrr had little control over his new body. Gromph trusted in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne set of trigger words from completing the spell, the enormous black tail of the blackstone gigant rolled over him. Gromph felt the words stop in his throat and felt his joints stiffen then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel stood and looked from scrying device to scrying device, trying to sort out what she was hearing. The magically transmitted voices of a hundred mages, priestesses, and warriors filled the air in an incoherent tangle of confusion and undisguised bliss. The doors of the scrying chamber burst open, and a priestess whom Triel recognized but whose name she couldn\u0027t instantly recall staggered into the room. Tears streamed down her black cheeks, and her mouth worked in silent, incoherent attempts to put into words what she, Triel, Wilara, and every other servant of the Queen of the Demonweb Pits all across the endless expanse of the multiverse had experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron mother\u0027s attention fell on one image: Gromph, petrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had lost. The lich, in its freakish monster form, had turned the Archmage of Menzoberranzan to stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel felt her jaw tighten then she stood for a moment, letting the anger wash through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a sign?\" she asked the Spider Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth didn\u0027t answer, but Triel knew she could if she wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a sign,\" the matron mother whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel pressed her fingertips together, bent her neck in a slight bow, and willed herself to the Bazaar. There was a momentary feeling of upside down weightlessness, a black void, then she was standing in a deep crack in the stone floor of her city\u0027s marketplace. The blackstone gigant reared up high above her, apparently having sensed her passage through the dimensions from House Baenre to the Bazaar. The creature opened its mouth to roar at her, but Triel spoke a few words, and it froze. The great, thrashing tail came to a sudden stop. It was as if time itself had taken a moment\u0027s pause. Smoke still rose around her, and the animated stone drow lumbered on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has gone on long enough, lich,\" Triel said, \"all of it. I will have no more dead drow, no more of my city ruined, no more challenges to my power or to the power of Lolth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel doubted the lichdrow could understand her. He seemed to have been subsumed by his adopted form, but she said it to everyone she knew was listening in, from House Baenre, Arach-Tinilith, Sorcere, and perhaps beyond the city into the command tents of her enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called directly upon Lolth, beseeching the restored goddess for her most potent spell, asking for nothing less than a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth didn\u0027t answer in a drow\u0027s voice as she had in the past. There were no words, only a feeling, a swelling of power, a rush of blood in the matron mother\u0027s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel sank to her knees amid a scattering of rough gravel and broken glass and pressed her forehead to the cool ground. She didn\u0027t express her desires in words. She didn\u0027t have to. What she was working was a wave of emotion, of feeling, of pure fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terror of Lolth herself blasted out in all directions at once, in an expanding circle of fear with Triel at its center. All across the City of Spiders, drow stopped in their tracks, fell to their knees, or lay prone. Some leaned against walls or collapsed on stairs, but all of them knew the purest fear, the fear of a goddess, the fear of the eternal, the fear of chaos, the fear of darkness, the fear of the unknown, the fear of the certain, the fear of treason, and a thousand other horrors that brought the city to a full stop. The blackstone gigant trembled and broke apart. Triel, still kneeling below it, didn\u0027t dodge the falling black boulders, the pieces of the titanic construct, which disappeared before they hit the ground. Within seconds all that was left of the rampaging creature was the lichdrow, stunned, reeling, kneeling on the crumbling floor of the Bazaar a few paces in front of the matron mother. The animated statues stopped moving and stood frozen in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wave of fear moved onward, past the walls of the city\u0027s vault and into the crowded approaches to the Underdark beyond. It passed through the duergar lines, overtook the retreating tanarukks, and blindsided the scattered illithid spies. It affected all of them in different ways, but it affected all of them. By the time it was done-and it didn\u0027t take long-there was no question, anywhere, that Lolth was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel stood and surveyed the damage. She looked down at Dyrr and knew she could simply step over to him and kill him with a thought-or at least a dagger blade across his undead throat-but she didn\u0027t. Killing the lich was someone else\u0027s job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron mother stepped to the rigid, calcified form of her brother. The expression frozen on his face was one of anger. Triel smiled at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Gromph,\" she said. \"You couldn\u0027t do it alone after all, could you? There are limits to your power as there are limits to mine, but together ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel embraced the petrified form of her brother, wrapping her arms around his back as she whispered a prayer to Lolth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth came first, then softness, then a breath, then movement, and Gromph\u0027s knees collapsed. Triel held him up, and he grasped her around the waist, his head lolling on her shoulder as he drew in a series of ragged, phlegmy breaths. When his legs came back under him, Triel released him and stepped back. Their eyes met, and Gromph opened his mouth to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Triel said, stopping him. She glanced at the quickly recovering Dyrr, and her brother\u0027s eyes followed hers. \"Finish what you started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to speak again, but Triel turned her back on him. She could hear his feet shifting on the loose gravel and glass, and she knew he was facing his enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriel walked away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-27.html","bookId":2163,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:06 PM"}
