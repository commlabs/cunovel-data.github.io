The old man never spoke about his age, but everyone knew it to be over seventy-five. Yet his mind was keen, and if he had finally allowed himself to be made Director-Emeritus of Research with Bogert as acting Director, it did not prevent him from appearing in his office daily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How close are they to the Hyperatomic Drive?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she replied irritably, \"I didn\u0027t ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. I wish they\u0027d hurry. Because if they don\u0027t, Consolidated might beat them to it, and beat us to it as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consolidated. What have they got to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027re not the only ones with calculating machines. Ours may be positronic, but that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re better. Robertson is calling a big meeting about it tomorrow. He\u0027s been waiting for you to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobertson of U. S. Robot amp; Mechanical Men Corporation, son of the founder, pointed his lean nose at his general manager and his Adam\u0027s apple jumped as he said, \"You start now. Let\u0027s get this straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general manager did so with alacrity, \"Here\u0027s the deal now, chief. Consolidated Robots approached us a month ago with a funny sort of proposition. They brought about five tons of figures, equations, all that sort of stuff. It was a problem, see, and they wanted an answer from The Brain. The terms were as follows-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ticked them off on thick fingers: \"A hundred thousand for us if there is no solution and we can tell them the missing factors. Two hundred thousand if there is a solution, plus costs of construction of the machine involved, plus quarter interest in all profits derived therefrom. The problem concerns the development of an interstellar engine-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobertson frowned and his lean figure stiffened, \"Despite the fact that they have a thinking machine of their own. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what makes the whole proposition a foul ball, chief? Levver, take it from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbe Levver looked up from the far end of the conference table and smoothed his stubbled chin with a faint rasping sound. He smiled:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s this way, sir. Consolidated had a thinking machine. It\u0027s broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Robertson half rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Broken! It\u0027s kaput. Nobody knows why, but I got hold of some pretty interesting guesses\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;like, for instance, that they asked it to give them an interstellar engine with the same set of information they came to us with, and that it cracked their machine wide open. It\u0027s scrap\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;just scrap now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get it, chief?\" The general manager was wildly jubilant. \"You get it? There isn\u0027t any industrial research group of any size that isn\u0027t trying to develop a space-warp engine, and Consolidated and U. S. Robots have the lead on the field with our super robot-brains. Now that they\u0027ve managed to foul theirs up, we have a clear field. That\u0027s the nub, the... uh... motivation. It will take them six years at least to build another and they\u0027re sunk, unless they can break ours, too, with the same problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president of U. S. Robots bulged his eyes, \"Why, the dirty rats-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on, chief. There\u0027s more to this.\" He pointed a finger with a wide sweep, \"Lanning, take it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Alfred Lanning viewed the proceedings with faint scorn\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;his usual reaction to the doings of the vastly better-paid business and sales divisions. His unbelievable gray eyebrows hunched low and his voice was dry:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From a scientific standpoint the situation, while not entirely clear, is subject to intelligent analysis. The question of interstellar travel under present conditions of physical theory is... uh... vague. The matter is wide open\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and the information given by Consolidated to its thinking machine, assuming these we have to be the same, was similarly wide open. Our mathematical department has given it a thorough analysis, and it seems Consolidated has included everything. Its material for submission contains all known developments of Franciacci\u0027s space-warp theory, and, apparently, all pertinent astrophysical and electronic data. It\u0027s quite a mouthful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobertson followed anxiously. He interrupted, \"Too much for The Brain to handle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanning shook his head decisively, \"No. There are no known limits to The Brain\u0027s capacity. It\u0027s a different matter. It\u0027s a question of the Robotic Laws. The Brain, for instance, could never supply a solution to a problem set to it if that solution, would involve the death or injury of humans. As far as it would be concerned, a problem with only such a solution would be insoluble. If such a problem is combined with an extremely urgent demand that it be answered, it is just possible that The Brain, only a robot after all, would be presented with a dilemma, where it could neither answer nor refuse to answer. Something of the sort must have happened to Consolidated\u0027s machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, but the general manager urged on, \"Go ahead, Dr. Tanning. Explain it the way you explained it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanning set his lips and raised his eyebrows in the direction of Dr. Susan Calvin who lifted her eyes from her precisely folded hands for the first time. Her voice was low and colorless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The nature of a robot reaction to a dilemma is startling,\" she began. \"Robot psychology is far from perfect\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as a specialist, I can assure you of that but it can be discussed in qualitative terms, because with all the complications introduced into a robot\u0027s positronic brain, it is built by humans and is therefore built according to human values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now a human caught in an impossibility often responds by a retreat from reality: by entry into a world of delusion, or by taking to drink, going off into hysteria, or jumping off a bridge. It all comes to the same thing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a refusal or inability to face the situation squarely. And so, the robot, a dilemma at its mildest will disorder half its relays; and at its worst it will burn out every positronic brain path past repair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" said Robertson, who didn\u0027t. \"Now what about this information Consolidated\u0027s wishing on us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It undoubtedly involves,\" said Dr. Calvin, \"a problem of a forbidden sort. But The Brain is considerably different from Consolidated\u0027s robot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, chief. That\u0027s right.\" The general manager was energetically interruptive. \"I want you to get this, because it\u0027s the whole point of the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Calvin\u0027s eyes glittered behind the spectacles, and she continued patiently, \"You see, sir, Consolidated\u0027s machines, their Super-Thinker among them, are built without personality. They go in for functionalism, you know\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they have to, without U. S. Robot\u0027s basic patents for the emotional brain paths. Their Thinker is merely a calculating machine on a grand scale, and a dilemma ruins it instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However, The Brain, our own machine, has a personality\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a child\u0027s personality. It is a supremely deductive brain, but it resembles an idiot savant. It doesn\u0027t really understand what it does\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it just does it. And because it is really a child, it is more resilient. Life isn\u0027t so serious, you might say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robopsychologist continued: \"Here is what we\u0027re going to do. We have divided all of Consolidated\u0027s information into logical units. We are going to feed the units to The Brain singly and cautiously. When the factor enters\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the one that creates the dilemma\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Brain\u0027s child personality will hesitate. Its sense of judgment is not mature. There will be a perceptible interval before it will recognize a dilemma as such. And in that interval, it will reject the unit automatically\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;before its brainpaths can be set in motion and ruined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobertson\u0027s Adam\u0027s apple squirmed, \"Are you sure, now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Calvin masked impatience, \"It doesn\u0027t make much sense, I admit, in lay language; but there is no conceivable use in presenting the mathematics of this. I assure you, it is as I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general manager was in the breach instantly and fluently, \"So here\u0027s the situation, chief. If we take the deal, we can put it through like this. The Brain will tell us which unit of information involves the dilemma. From there, we can figure why the dilemma. Isn\u0027t that right, Dr. Bogert? There you are, chief, and Dr. Bogert is the best mathematician you\u0027ll find anywhere. We give Consolidated a \u0027No Solution\u0027 answer, with the reason, and collect a hundred thousand. They\u0027re left with a broken machine; we\u0027re left with a whole one. In a year, two maybe, we\u0027ll have a space-warp engine or a hyper-atomic motor some people call it. Whatever you name it, it will be the biggest thing in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobertson chuckled and reached out, \"Let\u0027s see the contract. I\u0027ll sign it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Susan Calvin entered the fantastically guarded vault that held The Brain, one of the current shift of technicians had just asked it: \"If one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days, how many eggs will nine chickens lay in nine days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brain had just answered, \"Fifty-four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the technician had just said to another, \"See, you dope!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Calvin coughed and there was a sudden impossible flurry of directionless energy. The psychologist motioned briefly, and she was alone with The Brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brain was a two-foot globe merely\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one which contained within it a thoroughly conditioned helium atmosphere, a volume of space completely vibration-absent and radiation-free\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and within that was that unheard-of complexity of positronic brain-paths that was The Brain. The rest of the room was crowded with the attachments that were the intermediaries between The Brain and the outside world\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;its voice, its arms, its sense organs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Calvin said softly, \"How are you, Brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brain\u0027s voice was high-pitched and enthusiastic, \"Swell, Miss Susan. You\u0027re going to ask me something. I can tell. You always have a book in your hand when you\u0027re going to ask me something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Calvin smiled mildly, \"Well, you\u0027re right, but not just yet. This is going to be a question. It will be so complicated we\u0027re going to give it to you in writing. But not just yet; I think I\u0027ll talk to you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I don\u0027t mind talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Brain, in a little while, Dr. Lanning and Dr. Bogert will be here with this complicated question. We\u0027ll give it to you a very little at a time and very slowly, because we want you to be careful. We\u0027re going to ask you to build something, if you can, out of the information, but I\u0027m going to warn you now that the solution might involve... uh... damage to human beings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gosh!\" The exclamation was hushed, drawn-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you watch for that. When we come to a sheet which means damage, even maybe death, don\u0027t get excited. You see, Brain, in this case, we don\u0027t mind\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not even about death; we don\u0027t mind at all. So when you come to that sheet, just stop, give it back\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and that\u0027ll be all. You understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. By golly, the death of humans! Oh, my!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Brain, I hear Dr. Lanning and Dr. Bogert coming. They\u0027ll tell you what the problem is all about and then we\u0027ll start. Be a good boy, now-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly the sheets were fed in. After each one came the interval of the queerly whispery chuckling noise that was The Brain in action. Then the silence that meant readiness for another sheet. It was a matter of hours\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;during which the equivalent of something like seventeen fat volumes of mathematical physics were fed into The Brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the process went on, frowns appeared and deepened. Lanning muttered ferociously under his breath. Bogert first gazed speculatively at his fingernails, and then bit at them in abstracted fashion. It was when the last of the thick pile of sheets disappeared that Calvin, white-faced, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanning barely got the words out, \"It can\u0027t be. Is it\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brain?\" Susan Calvin was trembling. \"Do you hear me, Brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" came the abstracted rejoinder. \"Do you want me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The solution-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that! I can do it. I\u0027ll build you a whole ship, just as easy\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;if you let me have the robots. A nice ship, it\u0027ll take two months maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no difficulty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It took long to figure,\" said The Brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Calvin backed away. The color had not returned to her thin cheeks. She motioned the others away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her office, she said, \"I can\u0027t understand it. The information, as given, must involve a dilemma\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;probably involves death. If something has gone wrong-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogert said quietly, \"The machine talks and makes sense. It can\u0027t be a dilemma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the psychologist replied urgently, \"There are dilemmas and dilemmas. There are different forms of escape. Suppose The Brain is only mildly caught; just badly enough, say, to be suffering from the delusion that he can solve the problem, when he can\u0027t. Or suppose it\u0027s teetering on the brink of something really bad, so that any small push shoves it over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose,\" said Lanning, \"there is no dilemma. Suppose Consolidated\u0027s machine broke down over a different question, or broke down for purely mechanical reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But even so,\" insisted Calvin, \"we couldn\u0027t take chances. Listen, from now on, no one is to as much as breathe to The Brain. I\u0027m taking over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" sighed Lanning, \"take over, then. And meanwhile we\u0027ll let The Brain build its ship. And if it does build it, we\u0027ll have to test it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ruminating, \"We\u0027ll need our top field men for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Donovan brushed down his red hair with a violent motion of his hand and a total indifference to the fact that the unruly mass sprang to attention again immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Call the turn now, Greg. They say the ship is finished. They don\u0027t know what it is, but it\u0027s finished. Let\u0027s go, Greg. Let\u0027s grab the controls right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said wearily, \"Cut it, Mike. There\u0027s a peculiar overripe flavor to your humor at its freshest, and the confined atmosphere here isn\u0027t helping it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, listen,\" Donovan took another ineffectual swipe at his hair, \"I\u0027m not worried so much about our cast-iron genius and his tin ship. There\u0027s the matter of my lost leave. And the monotony! There\u0027s nothing here but whiskers and figures\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the wrong kind of figures. Oh, why do they give us these jobs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" replied Powell, gently, \"we\u0027re no loss, if they lose us. O.K., relax!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Doc Lanning\u0027s coming this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanning was coming, his gray eyebrows as lavish as ever, his aged figure unbent as yet and full of life. He walked silently up the ramp with the two men and out into the open field, where, obeying no human master, silent robots were building a ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong tense. Had built a ship!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Lanning said, \"The robots have stopped. Not one has moved today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s completed then? Definitely?\" asked Powell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now how can I tell?\" Lanning was peevish, and his eyebrows curled down in an eye-hiding frown. \"It seems done. There are no spare pieces about, and the interior is down to a gleaming finish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in, then out. I\u0027m no space-pilot. Either of you two know much about engine theory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan looked at Powell, who looked at Donovan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan said, \"I\u0027ve got my license, sir, but at last reading it didn\u0027t say anything about hyper-engines or warp-navigation. Just the usual child\u0027s play in three dimensions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlfred Lanning looked up with sharp disapproval and snorted the length of his prominent nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said frigidly, \"Well, we have our engine men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell caught at his elbow as he walked away, \"Sir, is the ship still restricted ground?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old director hesitated, then rubbed the bridge of his nose, \"I suppose not. For you two anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan looked after him as he left and muttered a short, expressive phrase at his back. He turned to Powell, \"I\u0027d like to give him a literary description of himself, Greg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose you come along, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the ship was finished, as finished as a ship ever was; that could be told in a single eye-blinking glance. No martinet in the system could have put as much spit-and-polish into a surface as those robots had. The walls were of a gleaming silvery finish that retained no fingerprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no angles; walls, floors, and ceiling faded gently into each other and in the cold, metallic glittering of the hidden lights, one was surrounded by six chilly reflections of one\u0027s bewildered self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main corridor was a narrow tunnel that led in a hard, clatter-footed stretch along a line of rooms of no interdistinguishing features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said, \"I suppose furniture is built into the wall. Or maybe we\u0027re not supposed to sit or sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the last room, the one nearest the nose, that the monotony broke. A curving window of non-reflecting glass was the first break in the universal metal, and below it was a single large dial, with a single motionless needle hard against the zero mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan said, \"Look at that!\" and pointed to the single word on the finely-marked scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt said, \"Parsecs\" and the tiny figure at the right end of the curving, graduated meter said \"1,000,000.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two chairs; heavy, wide-flaring, uncushioned. Powell seated himself gingerly, and found it molded to the body\u0027s curves, and comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said, \"What do you think of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my money, The Brain has brain-fever. Let\u0027s get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you don\u0027t want to look it over a bit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have looked it over. I came, I saw, I\u0027m through!\" Donovan\u0027s red hair bristled into separate wires, \"Greg, let\u0027s get out of here. I quit my job five seconds ago, and this is a restricted area for non-personnel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell smiled in an oily self-satisfied manner and smoothed his mustache, \"O.K., Mike, turn off that adrenalin tap you\u0027ve got draining into your bloodstream. I was worried, too, but no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more, huh? How come, no more? Increased your insurance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, this ship can\u0027t fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027ve been through the entire ship, haven\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take my word for it, we have. Did you see any pilot room except for this one port and the one gauge here in parsecs? Did you see any controls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you see any engines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy Joe, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then! Let\u0027s break the news to Lanning, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cursed their way through the featureless corridors and finally hit-and-missed their way into the short passage to the air lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan stiffened, \"Did you lock this thing, Greg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I never touched it. Yank the lever, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lever never budged, though Donovan\u0027s face twisted appallingly with exertion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said, \"I didn\u0027t see any emergency exits. If something\u0027s gone wrong here, they\u0027ll have to melt us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and we\u0027ve got to wait until they find out that some fool has locked us in here,\" added Donovan, frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get back to the room with the port. It\u0027s the only place from which we might attract attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that last room, the port was no longer blue and full of sky. It was black, and hard yellow pin-point stars spelled space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a dull, double thud, as two bodies collapsed separately into two chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlfred Lanning met Dr. Calvin just outside his office. He lit a nervous cigar and motioned her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Well, Susan, we\u0027ve come pretty far, and Robertson\u0027s getting jumpy. What are you doing with The Brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Calvin spread her hands, \"It\u0027s no use getting impatient. The Brain is worth more than anything we forfeit on this deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve been questioning it for two months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe psychologist\u0027s voice was flat, but somehow dangerous, \"You would rather run this yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you know what I meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I suppose I do,\" Dr. Calvin rubbed her hands nervously. \"It isn\u0027t easy. I\u0027ve been pampering it and probing it gently, and I haven\u0027t gotten anywhere yet. Its\u0027 reactions aren\u0027t normal. Its answers\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they\u0027re queer, somehow. But nothing I can put my finger on yet. And you see, until we know what\u0027s wrong, we must just tiptoe our way through. I can never tell what simple question or remark will just... push him over... and then\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Well, and then we\u0027ll have on our hands a completely useless Brain. Do you want to face that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it can\u0027t break the First Law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have thought so, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not even sure of that?\" Lanning was profoundly shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I can\u0027t be sure of anything, Alfred-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alarm system raised its fearful clangor with a horrifying suddenness. Lanning clicked on communications with an almost paralytic spasm. The breathless words froze him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Susan... you heard that... the ship\u0027s gone. I sent those two field men inside half an hour ago. You\u0027ll have to see The Brain again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Calvin said with enforced calm, \"Brain, what happened to the ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brain said happily, \"The ship I built, Miss Susan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. What has happened to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, nothing at all. The two men that were supposed to test it were inside, and we were all set. So I sent it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Well, that\u0027s nice.\" The psychologist felt some difficulty in breathing. \"Do you think they\u0027ll be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right as anything, Miss Susan. I\u0027ve taken care of it all. It\u0027s a bee-yootiful ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Brain, it is beautiful, but you think they have enough food, don\u0027t you? They\u0027ll be comfortable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenty of food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This business might be a shock to them, Brain. Unexpected, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brain tossed it off, \"They\u0027ll be all right. It ought to be interesting for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just interesting,\" said The Brain, slyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan,\" whispered Lanning in a fuming whisper, \"ask him if death comes into it. Ask him what the dangers are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Calvin\u0027s expression contorted with fury, \"Keep quiet!\" In a shaken voice, she said to The Brain, \"We can communicate with the ship, can\u0027t we Brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they can hear you if you call by radio. I\u0027ve taken care of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. That\u0027s all for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce outside, Lanning lashed out ragingly, \"Great Galaxy, Susan, if this gets out, it will ruin all of us. We\u0027ve got to get those men back. Why didn\u0027t you ask it if there was danger of death\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;straight out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" said Calvin, with a weary frustration, \"that\u0027s just what I can\u0027t mention. If it\u0027s got a case of dilemma, it\u0027s about death. Anything that would bring it up badly might knock it completely out. Will we be better off then? Now, look, it said we could communicate with them. Let\u0027s do so, get their location, and bring them back. They probably can\u0027t use the controls themselves; The Brain is probably handling them remotely. Come!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quite a while before Powell shook himself together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike,\" he said, out of cold lips, \"did you feel an acceleration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan\u0027s eyes were blank, \"Huh? No... no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the redhead\u0027s fists clenched and he was out of his seat with sudden frenzied energy and up against the cold, wide-curving glass. There was nothing to see\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, \"Greg, they must have started the machine while we were inside. Greg, it\u0027s a put-up job; they fixed it up with the robot to jerry us into being the try-out boys, in case we were thinking of backing out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said, \"What are you talking about? What\u0027s the good of sending us out if we don\u0027t know how to run the machine? How are we supposed to bring it back? No, this ship left by itself, and without any apparent acceleration.\" He rose, and walked the floor slowly. The metal walls dinned back the clangor of his steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said tonelessly, \"Mike, this is the most confusing situation we\u0027ve ever been up against.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" said Donovan, bitterly, \"is news to me. I was just beginning to have a very swell time, when you told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell ignored that. \"No acceleration\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which means the ship works on a principle different from any known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different from any we know, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different from any known. There are no engines within reach of manual control. Maybe they\u0027re built into the walls. Maybe that\u0027s why they\u0027re thick as they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you mumbling about?\" demanded Donovan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not listen? I\u0027m saying that whatever powers this ship is enclosed, and evidently not meant to be handled. The ship is running by remote control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Brain\u0027s control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you think we\u0027ll stay out here till The Brain brings us back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be. If so, let\u0027s wait quietly. The Brain is a robot. It\u0027s got to follow the First Law. It can\u0027t hurt a human being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan sat down slowly, \"You figure that?\" Carefully, he flattened his hair, \"Listen, this junk about the space-warp knocked out Consolidated\u0027s robot, and the longhairs said it was because interstellar travel killed humans. Which robot are you going to trust? Ours had the same data, I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell was yanking madly at his mustache, \"Don\u0027t pretend you don\u0027t know your robotics, Mike. Before it\u0027s physically possible in any way for a robot to even make a start to breaking the First Law, so many things have to break down that it would be a ruined mess of scrap ten times over. There\u0027s some simple explanation to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sure, sure. Just have the butler call me in the morning. It\u0027s all just too, too simple for me to bother about before my beauty nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Jupiter, Mike, what are you complaining about so far? The Brain is taking care of us. This place is warm. It\u0027s got light. It\u0027s got air. There wasn\u0027t even enough of an acceleration jar to muss your hair if it were smooth enough to be mussable in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Greg, you must\u0027ve taken lessons. No one could put Pollyanna that far out of the running without. What do we eat? What do we drink? Where are we? How do we get back? And in case of accident, to what exit and in what spacesuit do we run, not walk? I haven\u0027t even seen a bathroom in the place, or those little conveniences that go along with bathrooms. Sure, we\u0027re being taken care of\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that interrupted Donovan\u0027s tirade was not Powell\u0027s. It was nobody\u0027s. It was there, hanging in open air\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;stentorian and petrifying in its effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"GREGORY POWELL! MICHAEL DONOVAN! GREGORY POWELL! MICHAEL DONOVAN! PLEASE REPORT YOUR PRESENT POSITIONS. IF YOUR SHIP ANSWERS CONTROLS, PLEASE RETURN TO BASE. GREGORY POWELL! MICHAEL DONOVAN! -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message was repetitious, mechanical, broken by regular, untiring intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan said, \"Where\u0027s it coming from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Powell\u0027s voice was an intense whisper, \"Where do the lights come from? Where does anything come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, how are we going to answer?\" They had to speak in the intervals between the loudly echoing, repeating message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls were bare\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as bare and as unbroken as smooth, curving metal can be. Powell said, \"Shout an answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did. They shouted, in turns, and together, \"Position unknown! Ship out of control! Condition desperate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir voices rose and cracked. The short businesslike sentences became interlarded and adulterated with screaming and emphatic profanity, but the cold, calling voice repeated and repeated and repeated unwearyingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t hear us,\" gasped Donovan. \"There\u0027s no sending mechanism. Just a receiver.\" His eyes focused blindly at a random spot on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly the din of the outside voice softened and receded. They called again when it was a whisper, and they called again, hoarsely, when there was silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething like fifteen minutes later, Powell said lifelessly, \"Let\u0027s go through the ship again. There must be something to eat somewheres.\" He did not sound hopeful. It was almost an admission of defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey divided in the corridor to the right and left. They could follow one another by the hard footsteps resounding, and they met occasionally in the corridor, where they would glare at each other and pass on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell\u0027s search ended suddenly and as it did, he heard Donovan\u0027s glad voice rise boomingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Greg,\" it howled, \"The ship has got plumbing. How did we miss it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was some five minutes later that he found Powell by hit-and-miss. He was saying, \"Still no shower baths, though,\" but it got choked off in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Food,\" he gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall had dropped away, leaving a curved gap with two shelves. The upper shelf was loaded with unlabeled cans of a bewildering variety of sizes and shapes. The enameled cans on the lower shelf were uniform and Donovan felt a cold draft about his ankles. The lower half was refrigerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How... how-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t there, before,\" said Powell, curtly. \"That wall section dropped out of sight as I came in the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was eating. The can was the preheating type with enclosed spoon and the warm odor of baked beans filled the room. \"Grab a can, Mike!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan hesitated, \"What\u0027s the menu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I know! Are you finicky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but all I eat on ships are beans. Something else would be first choice.\" His hand hovered and selected a shining elliptical can whose flatness seemed reminiscent of salmon or similar delicacy. It opened at the proper pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beans!\" howled Donovan, and reached for another. Powell hauled at the slack of his pants. \"Better eat that, sonny boy. Supplies are limited and we may be here a long, long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan drew back sulkily, \"Is that all we have? Beans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s on the lower shelf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just milk?\" Donovan cried in outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meal of beans and milk was carried through in silence, and as they left, the strip of hidden wall rose up and formed an unbroken surface once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell sighed, \"Everything automatic. Everything just so. Never felt so helpless in my life. Where\u0027s your plumbing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right there. And that wasn\u0027t among those present when we first looked, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later they were back in the glassed-in room, staring at each other from opposing seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell looked gloomily at the one gauge in the room. It still said \"parsecs,\" the figures still ended in \"1,000,000\" and the indicating needle was still pressed hard against the zero mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the innermost offices of the U. S. Robot amp; Mechanical Men Corp. Alfred Lanning was saying wearily, \"They won\u0027t answer. We\u0027ve tried every wavelength, public, private, coded, straight, even this subether stuff they have now. And The Brain still won\u0027t say anything?\" He shot this at Dr. Calvin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t amplify on the matter, Alfred,\" she said, emphatically. \"It says they can hear us... and when I try to press it, it becomes... well, it becomes sullen.

It admits it controls the ship itself entirely. It is definitely optimistic about their safety, but without details. I don\u0027t dare press it. However, the center of disturbance seems to be about the interstellar jump itself. The Brain definitely laughed when I brought up the subject. There are other indications, but that is the closest it\u0027s come to an open abnormality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the others, \"I refer to hysteria. I dropped the subject immediately, and I hope I did no harm, but it gave me a lead. I can handle hysteria. Give me twelve hours! If I can bring it back to normal, it will bring back the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogert seemed suddenly stricken. \"The interstellar jump!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" The cry was double from Calvin and Lanning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The figures for the engine The Brain gave us.

He said brusquely to Calvin, \"You take care of your end, Susan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, Bogert was talking eagerly, \"I tell you, Lanning, that\u0027s it. The interstellar jump is not instantaneous not as long as the speed of light is finite. Life can\u0027t exist... matter and energy as such can\u0027t exist in the space warp. I don\u0027t know what it would be like\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but that\u0027s it. That\u0027s what killed Consolidated\u0027s robot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan felt as haggard as he looked. \"Only five days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only five days. I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan looked about him wretchedly. The stars through the glass were familiar but infinitely indifferent. The walls were cold to the touch; the lights, which had recently flared up again, were unfeelingly bright; the needle on the gauge pointed stubbornly to zero; and Donovan could not get rid of the taste of beans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, morosely, \"I need a bath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell looked up briefly, and said, \"So do I. You needn\u0027t feel self-conscious. But unless you want to bathe in milk and do without drinking\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do without drinking eventually, anyway. Greg, where does this interstellar travel come in?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me. Maybe we just keep on going. We\u0027d get there, eventually. At least the dust of our skeletons would\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but isn\u0027t our death the whole point of The Brain\u0027s original breakdown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan spoke with his back to the other, \"Greg, I\u0027ve been thinking. It\u0027s pretty bad. There\u0027s not much to do\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;except walk around or talk to yourself. You know those stories about guys marooned in space. They go nuts long before they starve. I don\u0027t know, Greg, but ever since the lights went on, I feel funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence, then Powell\u0027s voice came thin and small, \"So do I. What\u0027s it like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redheaded figure turned, \"Feel funny inside. There\u0027s a pounding in me with everything tense. It\u0027s hard to breathe.

Do you feel vibration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down for a minute and listen. You don\u0027t hear it, but you feel it\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as if something\u0027s throbbing somewheres and it\u0027s throbbing the whole ship, and you, too, along with it. Listen-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah... yeah. What do you think it is, Greg? You don\u0027t suppose it\u0027s us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be.\" Powell stroked his mustache slowly. \"But it might be the ship\u0027s engines. It might be getting ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the interstellar jump. It may be coming and the devil knows what it\u0027s like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan pondered. Then he said, savagely, \"If it does, let it. But I wish we could fight. It\u0027s humiliating to have to wait for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, perhaps, Powell looked at his hand on the metal chair-arm and said with frozen calm, \"Feel the wall, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan did, and said, \"You can feel it shake, Greg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the stars seemed blurred. From somewhere came the vague impression of a huge machine gathering power with the walls, storing up energy for a mighty leap, throbbing its way up the scales of strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came with a suddenness and a stab of pain. Powell stiffened, and half-jerked from his chair. His sight caught Donovan and blanked out while Donovan\u0027s thin shout whimpered and died in his ears. Something writhed within him and struggled against a growing blanket of ice, that thickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething broke loose and whirled in a blaze of flickering light and pain. It fell\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and whirled and fell headlong into silence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a world of no motion and no sensation. A world of dim, unsensing consciousness; a consciousness of darkness and of silence and of formless struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of all a consciousness of eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a tiny white thread of ego\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;cold and afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the words came, unctuous and sonorous, thundering over him in a foam of sound:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your coffin fit differently lately?

It all exploded into a rainbow of sound that dripped its fragments onto an aching brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell was in the chair, again. He felt himself shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan\u0027s eyes were opening into two large popping bowls of glazed blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greg,\" he whispered in what was almost a sob. \"Were you dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... felt dead.\" He did not recognize his own croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan was obviously making a bad failure of his attempt to stand up, \"Are we alive now? Or is there more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... feel alive.\" It was the same hoarseness. Powell said cautiously, \"Did you... hear anything, when... when you were dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan paused, and then very slowly nodded his head, \"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Did you hear about coffins... and females singing... and the lines forming to get into Hell?

It was weak, but it was blue-white\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and the gleaming pea that was the distant source of light was not Old Sol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Powell pointed a trembling finger at the single gauge. The needle stood stiff and proud at the hairline whose figure read 300,000 parsecs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said, \"Mike if it\u0027s true, we must be out of the Galaxy altogether.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan said, \"Blazed Greg!

If it takes us back the way it brought us here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan stopped halfway up and sat back heavily into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell went on, \"We\u0027ll have to... die again, Mike\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" sighed Donovan, \"if we have to, we have to. At least it isn\u0027t permanent, not very permanent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Calvin was speaking slowly now. For six hours she had been slowly prodding The Brain\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for six fruitless hours. She was weary of repetitions, weary of circumlocutions, weary of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Brain, there\u0027s just one more thing. You must make a special effort to answer simply. Have you been entirely clear about the interstellar jump?

Golly, it isn\u0027t any trick through the warp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And on the other side, what will they see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stars and stuff. What do you suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next question slipped out, \"They\u0027ll be alive, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the interstellar jump won\u0027t hurt them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze as The Brain maintained silence.

The Brain said, \"Do I have to answer? About the jump, I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you don\u0027t want to. But it would be interesting\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I mean if you wanted to.\" Susan Calvin tried to be bright about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw-w-w. You spoil everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the psychologist jumped up suddenly, with a look of flaming insight on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my,\" she gasped. \"Oh, my.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she felt the tension of hours and days released in a burst. It was later that she told Lanning, \"I tell you it\u0027s all right. No, you must leave me alone, now. The ship will be back safely, with the men, and I want to rest. I will rest. Now go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship returned to Earth as silently, as unjarringly as it had left. It dropped precisely into place and the main lock gaped open. The two men who walked out felt their way carefully and scratched their rough and scrubbily-stubbled chins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, slowly and purposefully, the one with red hair knelt down and planted upon the concrete of the runway a firm, loud kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waved aside the crowd that was gathering and made gestures of denial at the eager couple that had piled out of the down-swooping ambulance with a stretcher between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregory Powell said, \"Where\u0027s the nearest shower?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were led away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were gathered, all of them, about a table. It was a full staff meeting of the brains of U. S. Robot amp; Mechanical Men Corp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly and climactically, Powell and Donovan finished a graphic and resounding story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Calvin broke the silence that followed. In the few days that had elapsed she had recovered her icy, somewhat acid, calm\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but still a trace of embarrassment broke through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strictly speaking,\" she said, \"this was my fault\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;all of it. When we first presented this problem to The Brain, as I hope some of you remember, I went to great lengths to impress upon it the importance of rejecting any item of information capable of creating a dilemma. In doing so I said something like \u0027Don\u0027t get excited about the death of humans. We don\u0027t mind it at all. Just give the sheet back and forget it.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm-m-m,\" said Lanning. \"What follows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The obvious. When that item entered its calculations which yielded the equation controlling the length of minimum interval for the interstellar jump\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it meant death for humans. That\u0027s where Consolidated\u0027s machine broke down completely. But I had depressed the importance of death to The Brain\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not entirely, for the First Law can never be broken\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but just sufficiently so that The Brain could take a second look at the equation. Sufficiently to give it time to realize that after the interval was passed through, the men would return to life\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;just as the matter and energy of the ship itself would return to being. This so-called \u0027death,\u0027 in other words, was a strictly temporary phenomenon. You see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked about her. They were all listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went on, \"So he accepted the item, but not without a certain jar. Even with death temporary and its importance depressed, it was enough to unbalance him very gently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought it out calmly, \"He developed a sense of humor\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s an escape, you see, a method of partial escape from reality. He became a practical joker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell and Donovan were on their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" cried Powell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan was considerably more colorful about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so,\" said Calvin. \"He took care of you, and kept you safe, but you couldn\u0027t handle any controls, because they weren\u0027t for you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;just for the humorous Brain. We could reach you by radio, but you couldn\u0027t answer. You had plenty of food, but all of it beans and milk. Then you died, so to speak, and were reborn, but the period of your death was made... well... interesting. I wish I knew how he did it. It was The Brain\u0027s prize joke, but he meant no harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No harm!\" gasped Donovan. \"Oh, if that cute little tyke only had a neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanning raised a quieting hand, \"All right, it\u0027s been a mess, but it\u0027s all over. What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Bogert, quietly, \"obviously it\u0027s up to us to improve the space-warp engine. There must be some way of getting around that interval of jump. If there is, we\u0027re the only organization left with a grand-scale super-robot, so we\u0027re bound to find it if anyone can. And then\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;U. S.

They landed U. S. Robots into quite a mess. It wasn\u0027t as bad a mess as they expected and it turned out well, but their intentions weren\u0027t pious.
