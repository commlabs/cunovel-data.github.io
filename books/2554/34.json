{"id":111891,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\u003cp\u003eHank stood at the window of his second-floor bedroom and thought about birds. A big, double-hung window. The room sported two of them. Thick, old-fashioned glass with faint ripples through it. But one large bird or a bunch of smaller, determined birds might break through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had birds on the brain because he\u0027d had that dream again and it was worse than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d expected to dream about Szeto and his Eurotrash enforcers with bullets through their heads. Those three dead bodies tangled on the floor, all staring eyes and punctured foreheads and blood, so much blood ... he couldn\u0027t get the image out of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe death and blood didn\u0027t bother him in the least - really, who gave a shit about Szeto and company? What did bother him was knowing that the guy he\u0027d been looking for all these months had done it. Killed all three - single-handed. Hank was glad now that he\u0027d never found him. Still couldn\u0027t figure out how he\u0027d got free. But the guy was back on the streets now, and he knew Hank had gone out to find some tools to mess him up, so it was a good chance he\u0027d be coming for Hank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad enough, but then the new Kicker Man dream. Not completely new - it started like the others with the K-Man being attacked in the dark by birds or something like birds, unable to fight them off, and finally knocked down and repeatedly buzzed. But it hadn\u0027t stopped there. The birds had left the Kicker Man laid out on the ground. As soon as they flew off, worms slid out of the ground and crawled all over the K-Man ... eating him. They didn\u0027t quit till they\u0027d devoured his diamond-shaped head, leaving behind a decapitated stick figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank didn\u0027t need any gypsy to interpret that dream. The K-Man was Kickerdom, and Hank was its head. Someone wanted Hank\u0027s head. And that someone could only be the guy known as Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Hank Thompson\u0027s head was staying right where it was, and the rest of Hank Thompson was staying right here. Neither that Jack guy nor anyone else was going to scare him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank was going to take steps. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-34.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
