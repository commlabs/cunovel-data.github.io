The South Sea Demon Region, Black Flood Dragon Clan, and the Great Zen Temple all had middle Revolving Core masters protecting their juniors. As for those Life Destruction powerhouses, they had already long since rushed towards the Demon God Imperial Palace. The special rules that governed this world may not necessarily have been able to suppress those strange old fellows.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe other disciples were mostly at the Xiantian realm.

However, as he pulled out the vine, the vine had already penetrated deep into the little brother’s body and taken root. Flesh and organs were pulled out with the vine. The little brother gave a pitiful, feeble cry. His face whitened and his life was on the verge of collapse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“These vines fear fire!” A Divine Phoenix Island disciple suddenly shouted.

He pressed his hands out flat, and a wave of searing fire burned down from the heavens. As the vines met these waves, they began to rapidly wither away.

However, these rules weren’t able to completely suppress these Life Destruction powerhouses; it was only that their flying speed was severely restricted.

As they entered deeper into this broken world, the laws that suppressed them became increasingly intense. And now, these late Revolving Core powerhouses no longer had the ability to fly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe female Elder among the three watched as the 20 plus beams of light in the air became increasingly blurry as they moved into the distance.
