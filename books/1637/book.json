It is the year 2524.\u0026nbsp; Harvest is a peaceful, prosperous farming colony on the very edge of human-controlled space.\u0026nbsp; But we have trespassed on holy ground--strayed into the path of an aggressive alien empire known as the Covenant.\u0026nbsp; What begins as a chance encounter between an alien privateer and a human freighter catapults mankind into a struggle for its very existence. But humanity is also locked in a bitter civil war known as the Insurrection.\u0026nbsp; So the survival of Harvest\u0027s citizens falls to a squad of battle-weary UNSC Marines and their inexperienced colonial militia trainees.\u0026nbsp; In this unlikely group of heroes, one stands above the rest...a young Marine staff sergeant named Avery Johnson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-contact-harvest-halo-5.jpg","author":"Joseph Staten","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/halo-contact-harvest-halo-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:57 PM"}
