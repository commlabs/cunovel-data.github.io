I called her number again and got the machine again, and asked her a couple of times to pick up if she was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t, and when five minutes went by without a call from her or anyone else, I decided that something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure how rational that was. I don\u0027t know how much of it derived from circumstance and how much from a combination of the dream and Michael\u0027s phone call. But I was sure something was wrong, and that I\u0027d damn well better do something about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Wentworth, and for a change I got him at his desk. \"Scudder,\" I said. \"I just wanted to know if you\u0027ve got men on Kristin Hollander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The order went in,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the order went in. What I wanted to know- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" he said, and went away. I stood there, shifting my weight from foot to foot, and he came back and said the order was still awaiting approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to say something but I\u0027d have been talking to myself. He was no longer on the line. I got a dial tone and tried Kristin one more time, but before the machine could pick up I cradled the receiver and got the hell out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a cab right away. The driver may have been the only cabby in the city to brake for yellow lights, so it took a little longer getting there than it might have, but I made myself sit back and take it easy. By the time we turned into Seventy-fourth Street I\u0027d cooled down enough to realize I was overreacting. We pulled up and I paid off my cabby and went up and rang her bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take her long, although it probably seemed longer than it was. Then I heard the cover of the peephole snick back, and I said my name, just in case age and anxiety had rendered me unrecognizable. And then she opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a great rush of relief, and at the same time felt like an alarmist and a damned fool. I was on the point of apologizing- I\u0027m not sure what for- but she beat me to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"You were afraid something happened to me, weren\u0027t you? That\u0027s why you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" she said, and sagged against me. She was sobbing, and I held her for a moment, then took hold of her by her upper arms and set her upright. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said again. \"Just give me a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and disappeared through a doorway, and when she came back a minute or two later the tears were gone and she\u0027d regained her composure. \"I did something I wasn\u0027t supposed to do,\" she said. \"Peter called, it must have been the third or fourth time, and he talked right through the machine to me. It\u0027s as if we were having this conversation, except he was doing all the talking, and I hadn\u0027t picked up the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you did pick up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t help it,\" she said. \"I tried to walk away but I couldn\u0027t, it would have been like hanging up on a person, except somehow worse. I don\u0027t know, it doesn\u0027t make any sense, but I picked up the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was going on and on about destiny, and how he wanted to be there for me, how all of them wanted to be there for me, and I just couldn\u0027t take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destiny,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I knew the only way to end this was to end it, so I told him to forget about destiny and forget about me, because I had to make a life for myself, and the life I had in mind didn\u0027t have room for him in it.\" She frowned. \"That sounds terribly cold and cruel, doesn\u0027t it? If anybody talked to me like that I\u0027d probably want to stick my head in the oven. But that\u0027s not how he took it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he was really grateful to me for telling the truth about how I felt. He said it helped cut through a lot of illusions. He said it was liberating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he meant it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know Peter. If he didn\u0027t mean it, he wouldn\u0027t say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the conversation took a long time, she said, and that must have been when I was getting the endless busy signals. Then when she got off the phone she felt exhausted, and decided she wanted to sit in the tub with last month\u0027s Vanity Fair and just wallow in somebody else\u0027s misery. She was just ready to get into the tub when the phone started to ring, and she thought it might be Peter, and she didn\u0027t want to talk to him again, and if it wasn\u0027t Peter it was probably some reporter, and whoever it was she wasn\u0027t supposed to answer it, so she just got in the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while she was soaking and reading about the murder of a Connecticut socialite, still unsolved after thirty years, the phone rang again. And again she let the machine get it, and stayed right where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then I got out and got dressed and came down here and played the messages,\" she said, \"and they were both from you, and you sounded really upset, and I grabbed the phone and called your number, but all I did was get your machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d left the house by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re here, and you made the trip for nothing, and I\u0027m really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it. I was as much to blame as you, and it got me out of the house, and that\u0027s not the worst thing that ever happened to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a bad dream last night,\" I said, \"about one of my sons. It was groundless, and everything\u0027s fine, but sometimes you can\u0027t really shake off that sort of thing without a change of scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said, a little awkwardly. \"Well, you were wonderful to come rushing over, but fortunately I\u0027m fine, and, uh, actually I was going through some papers upstairs. And I know you\u0027ve got things to do, and, well…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" I said. \"I\u0027d better be going. It\u0027s just that I\u0027m a little leery of leaving you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I promise not to answer the phone? Unless it\u0027s you, in which case I promise to answer right away? Remember, I\u0027ve got a couple of guardian angels posted outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My police protection,\" she said. \"I still haven\u0027t been able to spot them, but it\u0027s good to know they\u0027re there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I let her go on believing that? And what if she waltzed out the front door, confident her guards were there to protect her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I spoke to Wentworth. He hasn\u0027t been able to get authorization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought it was just a formality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess some precincts are more formal than others,\" I said, \"and some precinct commanders, or whatever deadhead\u0027s in charge up there. May I use your phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said, and grinned suddenly. \"I can\u0027t, but you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have four numbers for Ballou, and at that hour I wasn\u0027t at all confident he\u0027d be at any of them. But he picked up the phone at the third one I tried. I told him what I wanted in about five sentences, and all he wanted to know was the address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend of mine,\" I told her. \"He\u0027ll stay here in the house with you, and God help anybody who tries to get through the door.\" And I told her a little about my friend Mick Ballou, and watched her eyes widen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were sitting in the kitchen, waiting for him to ring the doorbell, when she said, \"Oh, I almost forgot. At least I managed to do something right when I talked to Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you cooled his ardor for keeps, I\u0027d say you did a lot of things right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides that. I found out his name.\" My confusion must have shown in my face, because she said, \"No, not Peter\u0027s name. Remember you wanted to know the man we saw for couple counseling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said Peter called him Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all called him Doc. I asked Peter what Doc\u0027s name was, and he couldn\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t remember. Doc played a much bigger role in Peter\u0027s life than in mine. Anyway, it turns out his name is Adam, and I swear I never knew that. I just remember him being introduced as Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did you say Dr. Nadler\u0027s first name was? Sheldon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seymour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was close. But not Adam, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"You said they all called him Doc. All his patients?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Peter and his friends. Maybe his other patients, too, but I don\u0027t know about them, just Peter and the four artists we were going to be sharing a house with in Williamsburg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all knew Adam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were all patients of his. I think they all met each other in group therapy, or something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Peter was talking about destiny,\" she said, \"and everything else he was saying, you could tell he was just parroting something he got from Adam. That was another reason I was sort of relieved when we broke up. Adam was good for Peter, I guess he was good for all of them, but I could picture the five of them all turning into little Adam Breit clones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam Breit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe him, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, gosh,\" she said. \"I only met him at the counseling sessions, and Peter and I spent most of our time looking at each other. Or not looking at each other. Let\u0027s see. He\u0027s about your height, and maybe a little slimmer, and, well, sort of ordinary-looking. This isn\u0027t helping much, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to use the phone again,\" I said, and went and picked it up. I found the number I wanted in my notebook, and dialed it, and caught her in. I said, \"It\u0027s Matthew Scudder again, Mrs. Watling. About the name of that therapist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it hasn\u0027t come to me,\" she said. \"I\u0027m so ashamed of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cheerful, optimistic name, you said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I can\u0027t- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t in court, no one was going to accuse me of leading the witness. I said, \"Could it have been Adam Breit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure? I don\u0027t want to- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s it! I couldn\u0027t swear to the Adam part, but the Breit part is absolutely right. Bright and sunny, bright and cheerful, bright as day, bright as a new copper penny. I don\u0027t know why that name wouldn\u0027t come to me. It seems so obvious now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thanked her and told her I\u0027d let her know how things worked out. Then I took a chair and we waited for Mick Ballou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmile in place, he emerges from the little room, saying, \"Bye-bye, see you soon,\" as he draws the door shut. He nods and smiles his way past the expressionless Korean minding the desk, and keeps the smile on his face until he is down the stairs and out of the building. He walks quickly to the corner, turns, and maintains a brisk pace, but not so brisk as to draw attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo great need to hurry. No one will open her door, not right away. They\u0027ll wait for her to come out on her own. And, when they do lose patience and knock, and open the door when the knock goes unanswered, all they\u0027ll see is an empty room. She must have come out unnoticed, they\u0027ll think, and gone to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, of course, someone will open the metal wardrobe, where he stuffed her body, along with her slippers and her red-orange dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one notices him, and in return he notices no one; waiting for the light at Columbus Avenue, he\u0027s so involved in his own thoughts that it changes twice before he remembers to cross the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s had a revelation, and he has to get it written down. It may have some scientific merit, but that\u0027s almost beside the point. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-41.html","bookId":2333,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM"}
