Lin Ming’s methods were truly as Charming had said. He had swept out all the other trial challengers in order to reduce the difficulty of the game so that he could pass it himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis method seemed completely farcical because not only was every trial challenger who entered extremely strong, but finding them in the vast game world wasn’t easy either.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYet Lin Ming had accomplished this, and his actions were neat and merciless.

There were only 12 trial challengers to begin with, and the other three badges were from the prey that some other trial challengers had killed. Now, their hard work had benefited Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s time to hunt… this is when the true game begins.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming licked his lips. In this dimensional realm there were all sorts of creatures. By killing them he could obtain skull badges.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe closed his eyes and let his sense spread outwards.

The grass and waters were bright and calm, without any waves at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming fell down towards the surface of the swamp.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust when Lin Ming was 40-50 feet from the water’s surface, the placid water surface suddenly exploded. A 100 foot long alligator rushed out at an unbelievable speed, causing thousands of jins of water and mud to shoot up. The alligator’s jaws were wide open, large enough to swallow a house. It bit down at Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKacha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe alligator’s jaws snapped together, swallowing Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, before it could fully swallow Lin Ming, the alligator’s head exploded.

Lin Ming had used the grandmist space to protect himself, and when he attacked with the Thunder and Fire Laws, he hadn’t been injured at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA shining skull badge fell into Lin Ming’s hand. This was the reward for hunting down the alligator.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this game world, there were only hunters and prey. Whoever was stronger was the hunter and whoever was weaker was the prey.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“These prey are really weak at the start.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked at the headless alligator corpse that was twitching beneath him. He flung out a fireball and burnt it to ashes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, the headless alligator completely vanished, turning into a stream of pure energy that flowed into the swamp.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So that’s how it is. All of the beasts in this world are energy beings. They aren’t illusions or material beings, but puppets made of energy. Perhaps the origin energy runes we paid to enter this trial are used to maintain the activation of the array formation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was thinking like this, his figure flashed as he flew to the next prey.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnder his incomparably powerful divine sense, none of these beasts could hide from his eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere wasn’t a single prey that was able to contend with Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s badge count slowly increased.

This lizard was a tad more formidable than the monsters before but it was essentially the same.

This was in order to test a trial challenger’s talent and not their absolute strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA lucky one-star Asura could already pass this checkpoint, let alone Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter hunting down 50 prey, the strength of the prey rose to yet another level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“They’re getting stronger.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe creatures grew increasingly strong. However, to Lin Ming, this difference was only killing them in five moves instead of three. He still easily exterminated them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis number of badges had now reached 60.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnother two hours later, he had reached 64!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is easy…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming took a brief rest as he readied himself to kill the 65\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eth\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e monster.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf he continued at this speed he would soon have killed 100 prey. However, he had a feeling that before he killed the final one, there would be some event that occurred.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was pondering this, the scenery around him suddenly changed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe power of space wildly flew around him, dizzying and mystifying. The grasslands vanished as Lin Ming suddenly arrived in a spacious wilderness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd at the same time, a pale red array formation appeared beneath Lin Ming’s feet. The runes flickered and shimmered. These runes were similar to the most common god runes of the Asura Road.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm… this is… an array formation?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs this thought flashed through Lin Ming’s mind, there was a series of clanking sounds as golden-armored warriors began to appear in front of Lin Ming. These warriors wore thick suits of golden armor. Their faces could not be seen, but their aura was filled with a thick killing intent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Puppets?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming paused.

Each warrior stepped atop an array symbol. In total, there were 36 warriors.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e36 warriors?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked down at the skull badges in his hand.

Whether it was the previous prey or other trial challengers, all of them can only be considered an appetizer. No matter if I killed them with ease or with great difficulty it still wouldn’t affect the final result, because in this Hunter Game I was destined to meet these 36 golden-armored warriors at the final checkpoint. No matter how many trial challengers enter this Hunter Game, the game will control the number of skull badges, making it so that only one person is able to face these last 36 golden-armored warriors, otherwise it would have been impossible to collect 64 badges to begin with. This is the final battle here.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thought.

He did not underestimate these new enemies. The divine god that created the Asura Road had reached an unimaginable level of martial arts cultivation. If this person were to establish a trial then the conditions for passing it must be extremely high! Even though Lin Ming was considered the number one talent of his race, he still wouldn’t underestimate anything here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?
