{"id":66902,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eChapter Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Sanchez directing me, we drove slowly through a quiet residential neighborhood filled with small suburban houses. It was late evening, about 7:00 p.m. We were about nine blocks from Disneyland. Hard to believe there was going to be a royal ass kicking down the road from the happiest place on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we drove, Jesus walked me through it. \"Charlene and I were walking home through Hill Park. It\u0027s a shortcut from school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like you walking through Hill Park,\" said Sanchez. \"That park\u0027s trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus and I ignored Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlene is...?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My girlfriend. At least one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two, but I keep two or three on the side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For emergencies?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was watching the kid through my rearview mirror. Jesus\u0027 face was turned, staring blankly out the side window. He was so little. Hard to imagine the kid being so tough. But he was. Somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"So you and Charlene are walking home through the park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we are surrounded by twelve guys. Most are on bikes. Some on skateboards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I told Charlene to beat it, and she did. They let her go, of course. They were after me, not her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were they after you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing I did, at least nothing I could help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of their girls took a liking to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I hear. Like I can keep track.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez shook his head, and pointed me down a side street. I turned the steering wheel. The Mustang rolled along smoothly, the engine throbbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they surround you, what happened next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them all to go ahead and kick my ass, but someday I was going to hunt each of them down one at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTough kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four of them took off running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they were scared of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez spoke up. \"They threw a rock at him, hit him in the mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Sanchez. He was staring straight ahead. His jawline was rigid. A vein pulsed in his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He who is without sin,\" I said, \"cast the first stone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus said, \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez shook his head. \"Ignore him. Go on, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rock hit me in the mouth, knocked out my front tooth. Split my lips open - lips that were made for kissing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez shook his head. \"I created a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I charged the one who threw it. Kid named Doyle. Jumped on top of him and started wailing on him. After that, things are just a big blur of fists and feet and blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They knocked him out,\" said Sanchez. \"His girl, whichever one she was, called 911. He was still unconscious when the police came. So were two of the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked in the rearview mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I don\u0027t really remember what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus was sitting in the middle of the bench seat, looking out the right window. He was unconsciously poking his tongue through the gap in his incisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez told me to stop in front of a smallish house with no porch light on. There was a chainlink fence around the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s this?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian. It was his girl who started this mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I turn twelve next month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re eleven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m old for my age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy are you ever. Need any help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, but now he was looking eagerly toward the small dark house. I looked, too. Not much was going on. There was some faint light coming from the back of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez said, \"I cased the house last week. The kid came home alone around this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cased?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have murderers to find?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian hangs out with his friends at this time,\" said Jesus. \"They have a gang. Pick on kids in school, harass teachers. They get suspended all the time, smoke cigarettes, sometimes even dope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here he comes,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down the street. A kid was coming towards us on a bike. Big kid. Much bigger than Jesus. And he was smoking. I could see the glowing tip of a cigarette. He passed under a streetlamp and I had a good look at his face. Wide cheekbones. Big head. The kid looked like a bully. Self-satisfied, content, mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled up next to the chain link fence across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car door banged open behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus was out, running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy flicked his cigarette away, stepped off the bike, and reached for the latch on the chain link fence. And turned his head just as a small dark figure tackled him hard to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI instinctively went for my door, but Sanchez put his hand on my shoulder. \"No. Jesus wants to do this on his own.\" Sanchez was frowning. He didn\u0027t like this either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other kid has him by about twenty pounds.\" And since these were just kids, twenty pounds was a significant advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus fights big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just enough leftover light from a nearby streetlight to see what was going on. Jesus had tackled the kid onto a grassy parkway. Now they were rolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropped over a curb and into the gutter. As this was southern California, the gutter was dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other kid, the bigger kid, landed on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jesus promptly reached up, grabbed a handful of the kid\u0027s hair, and yanked him off to the side. The kid screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost cheered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, I discovered, did not fight fairly. And in street fighting - and when you are younger and smaller, that was the only way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were rolling again, out into the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no cars coming, luckily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid better not get dirty,\" said Sanchez, shaking his head. \"We\u0027re supposed to be out getting ice cream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus might have other things on his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Hay-zeus, dammit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not,\" said Sanchez. \"For one thing, it\u0027s a completely different language. And considering you date a world renowned anthropologist, you show a surprising lack of cultural and religious sensitivity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The word you want is ethnocentric.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking one\u0027s culture is superior to others,\" I said. \"Most people in most cultures suffer from it. I, however, do not suffer from it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I happen to disagree,\" said Sanchez. \"You are one hell of an ethnocentric motherfucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts and the sound of smacking flesh reached our open windows. It was hard to tell who was doing the smacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your kid winning?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell, but it\u0027s a good bet. I told him not to kick his ass too bad. I didn\u0027t want his knuckles scuffed. His mother would have my head if she knew what we were doing. We\u0027re supposed to be getting ice cream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne kid staggered to his feet, while the other lay in the middle of the street in the fetal position. Luckily, no cars were coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid on his feet was smallish. Dark hair. Good looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSon of a bitch, I thought. He did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus surveyed the street, ignoring the moaning kid, spotted the bike. He staggered over to it, then dragged it over to a trash can by its front tire, sparks flying from where one of the peddles contacted the asphalt. He picked the bike up, and deposited it inside the trashcan, and closed the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very thorough,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus staggered over, pulled open the door and collapsed inside. I could smell his sweat and something else. Maybe blood, maybe bike grease. Outside, a couple of porchlights turned on, including the one we were parked in front of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone feel like ice cream?\" I asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mummy-case-jim-knighthorse-2/page-9.html","bookId":2352,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:49 AM"}
