This talent was high enough to stand evenly with an Empyrean descendant! Moreover, Lin Ming had not grown up in an Empyrean Heavenly Palace. Without the resources, inheritances, and teachers available at an Empyrean Heavenly Palace, he was at an enormous disadvantage, yet he had managed to accomplish what he did.

But, Lin Ming used his true strength to inform each and every one of them that regardless of how poor their background, their resources, their masters, or their inheritances were, they too could still reach the standard of an Empyrean descendant!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, Lin Ming seemed to be the only existence on the Divine Seal Altar, a hero that ruled over the world, standing arrogantly amongst society!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming actually won… he comprehended a fifth level Law Concept, and also has a transcendent divine might…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithin Vast Universe Heavenly Palace, Vast Cosmos was lost in thought for a moment. He took a light breath, observing everything happening around him. Then, he discovered that out of the many World Kings present, a black-clothed man was looking at him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis man’s eyes were deep and ghostly, his pupils red. He had a faint smile on his face, but for some reason, when he looked at Vast Cosmos, Vast Cosmos felt his mind jump. “Tian Mingzi, what is it?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Nothing much, haha…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi remained smiling as before, as if nothing was able to disturb his congenial mood. His descendant Nether Limitless had been suppressed by Lin Ming in terms of both talent and strength. Even so, in the face of such a situation, his ability to remain serene and smiling was not something that an ordinary World King would possess.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor many World Kings, the older they became, the more they cared about honor and face. They had nothing left to fight for, and it was nearly impossible for them to change who was already ranked weaker and stronger. Thus, they would place their energy on the struggles of the junior disciples. This was how things were. When neighbors met, they would often compete with their children’s achievements.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNormally, if the descendant of a World King were to be completely rolled over by someone else, they would be angrier than Huo Violentstone. But Tian Mingzi wasn’t moved at all. He still talked and happily laughed with those around him as before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm…” Vast Cosmos’s eyebrows jumped up. “Did Tian Mingzi realize something strange with the force field that Lin Ming used just now? Or was he trying to find some clue from my expression?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of these suspicions flashed through Vast Cosmos’s heart. For those at his level of strength, it was easy to figure out many things from how they reacted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The force field that Lin Ming used reminds me of someone… although I have never encountered him before, I have actually listened to Honorable Master speak of him. Honorable Master holds an extremely high admiration towards this person. According to Honorable Master’s description, the force field that Lin Ming used has some similarities to that person’s own unique ability!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I must report this matter to Honorable Master and have him decide for himself.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of these thoughts rapidly passed through Vast Cosmos’s mind. Even so, he maintained a stony expression, not allowing anyone to know what he was thinking.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a pity! Nephew Limitless was so close; he lost by a single move.” Wide Universe World King stroked his beard, a regretful look in his eyes as if Nether Limitless had been his own disciple.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm… Nephew Limitless has simultaneously obtained high comprehensions in the Space and Time Laws as well as the Water Laws. By spreading his energy between three Laws, he can’t compare to Lin Ming focusing on a single Law. Otherwise, with Nephew Limitless’s talent, he should have been able to enter the fifth level Concept. If that happened, then this would be a completely different scene altogether. It would be hard to tell just who the winner would have been.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnother World King powerhouse echoed, clearly looking for another reason to explain Nether Limitless’s defeat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fact, in their opinion, who cared if Lin Ming’s talent reached that of an Empyrean descendant? The current Tian Mingzi had a talent that surpassed most Empyrean descendants!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis future achievements would truly be incomparably terrifying, so what was the loss of a single Nether Limitless to Tian Mingzi? Thus, all of these World Kings praised and flattered Tian Mingzi in order to form better relations with him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi thought little of it. He only said, “Everyone, you all simply think too highly of Limitless. This descendant of mine is just a useless good-for-nothing. There have been so many resources used to raise him, and yet his achievements have been barely passable. As for that Lin Ming, he only comes from a peak Holy Land and yet he has such wonderful results. His talent is truly astounding. It is not an injustice that Limitless lost to him.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha!

If we try to force our own desires and wishes onto them, that will only increase the pressure on them and cause their future achievements to suffer.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Brother Nether’s carefree and relaxed attitude is truly worthy of praise.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs everyone was praising Tian Mingzi, no one brought up the transcendent divine might that Lin Ming had used. To them, this was a lucky chance that only Lin Ming could have experienced. For a character like Lin Ming, experiencing such lucky chances was well within reason.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf it were an ordinary genius, obtaining this sort of lucky chance would have instead been a recipe for disaster.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Lin Ming’s talent was comparable to an Empyrean descendant’s.
