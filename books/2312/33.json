What he did, he changed his mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He changed his mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It used to be a woman’s prerogative,” Dot said, “but now we’ve got equality between the sexes, so that means anyone can do it. It works out fine because we’re getting paid in full. So kick the dust of Texas off your feet and come on home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do that,” he said, “but I may hang out here for a few more days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or even a week,” he said. “It’s a pretty nice town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me you’re itching to move there, Keller. We’ve been through this before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing like that,” he said, “but there’s this girl I met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Keller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, she’s nice,” he said. “And if I’m off the job there’s no reason not to have a date or two with her, is there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as you don’t decide to move in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s not that nice,” he said, and Dot laughed and told him not to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up and drove around and found a movie he’d been meaning to see. The next morning he packed and checked out of his hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove across town and got a room on the motel strip, paying cash for four nights in advance and registering as J. D. Smith from Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no girl he’d met, no girl he wanted to meet. But it wasn’t time to go home yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had unfinished business, and four days should give him time to do it. Time for Wallace Garrity to get used to the idea of not feeling those imaginary crosshairs on his shoulder blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not so much time that the pain would be too much to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, sometime in those four days, Keller would give him a gift. If he could, he’d make it look natural-a heart attack, say, or an accident. In any event it would be swift and without warning, and as close as he could make it to painless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it would be unexpected. Garrity would never see it coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller frowned, trying to figure out how he would manage it. It would be a lot trickier than the task that had drawn him to town originally, but he’d brought it on himself. Getting involved, fishing the boy out of the pool. He’d interfered with the natural order of things. He was under an obligation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the least he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9 Keller\u0027s Last Refuge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK eller, reaching fora red carnation, paused to finger one of the green ones. Kelly green it was, and vivid. Maybe it was an autumnal phenomenon, he thought. The leaves turned red and gold, the flowers turned green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s dyed,” said the florist, reading his mind. “They started dyeing them for St. Patrick’s Day, and that’s when I sell the most of them, but they caught on in a small way year-round. Would you like to wear one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he? Keller found himself weighing the move, then reminded himself it wasn’t an option. “No,” he said. “It has to be red.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I quite agree,” the little man said, selecting one of the blood-red blooms. “I’m a traditionalist myself. Green flowers. Why, how could the bees tell the blooms from the foliage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller said it was a good question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And here’s another. Shall we lay itacross the buttonhole and pin it to the lapel, or shall we insert itinto the buttonhole?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a poser, all right. Keller asked the man for his recommendation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s controversial,” the florist said. “But I look at it this way. Whyhave a buttonhole if you’re not going touse it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, suit pressed and shoes shined and a red carnation in his lapel, boarded the Metroliner at Penn Station. He’d picked up a copy ofGQ at a newsstand in the station, and he made it last all the way to Washington. Now and then his eyes strayed from the page to his boutonniere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have been nice to know where the magazine stood on the buttonhole issue, but they had nothing to say on the subject. According to the florist, who admittedly had a small stake in the matter, Keller had nothing to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not every man can wear a flower,” the man had told him. “On one it will look frivolous, on another foppish. But with you-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More than okay,” the man said. “You wear it with a certain flair. Or dare I say panache?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanache, Keller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanache had not been the object. Keller was just following directions. Wear a particular flower, board a particular train, stand in front of the B. Dalton bookstore in Union Station with a particular magazine until the client-a particular man himself, from the sound of it-took the opportunity to make contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt struck Keller as a pretty Mickey Mouse way to do things, and in the old days the old man would have shot it down. But the old man wasn’t himself these days, and something like this, with props and recognition signals, was the least of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wear the flower,” Dot had told him in the kitchen of the big old house in White Plains. “Wear the flower, carry the magazine-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tote the barge, lift the bale… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-and do the job, Keller. At least he’s not turning everything down. What’s wrong with a flower, anyway? Don’t tell me you’ve got Thoreau on the brain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thoreau?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said to beware of enterprises that require new clothes. He never said a thing about carnations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten past noon Keller was at his post, wearing the flower, brandishing the magazine. He stood there like a tin soldier for half an hour, then left his post to find a men’s room. He returned feeling like a deserter, but took a minute to scan the area, looking for someone who was looking for him. He didn’t find anybody, so he planted himself where he’d been standing earlier and just went on standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a quarter after one he went to a fast-food counter for a hamburger. At ten minutes of two he found a phone and called White Plains. Dot answered, and before he could get out a full sentence she told him to come home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Job’s been canceled,” she said. “The guy phoned up and called it off. But you must have been halfway to D.C. by then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been standing around since noon,” Keller said. “I hate just standing around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everybody does, Keller. At least you’ll make a couple of dollars. It should have been half in advance…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldhave been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wanted to meet you first and find out if you thought the job was doable.Then he’d pay the first half, with the balance due and payable upon execution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExecution was the word for it. He said, “But he aborted before he met me. Doesn’t he like panache?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Panache?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The flower. Maybe he didn’t like the way I was wearing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keller,” she said, “he never even saw you. He called here around ten-thirty. You were still on the train. Anyway, how many ways are there to wear a flower?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get me started,” he said. “If he didn’t pay anything in advance-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He paid. But not half.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he pay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a fortune. He sent us a thousand dollars. Your end of that’s nothing to retire on, but all you had to do besides stand around was sit around, and there are people in this world who work harder and get less for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’ll bet it makesthem happy,” he said, “to hear how much better off they are than the poor bastards starving in Somalia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor Keller. What are you going to do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get on a train and come home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keller,” she said, “you’re in our nation’s capital. Go to the Smithsonian. Take a citizen’s tour of the White House. Slow down and smell the flowers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rang off and caught the next train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went home and hung up his suit, but not before discarding the touch of panache from his lapel. He’d already gotten rid of the magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was on a Wednesday. Monday morning he was in a booth at one of his usual breakfast places, a Greek coffee shop on Second Avenue. He was reading theTimes and eating a plate of salami and eggs when a fellow said, “Mind if I join you?” He didn’t wait for an answer, either, but slid unbidden into the seat across from Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller eyed him. The guy was around forty, wearing a dark suit and an unassertive tie. He was clean-shaven and his hair was combed. He didn’t look like a nut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ought to wear a boutonniere,” the man said. “It adds, I don’t know, a certain something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Panache,” Keller suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” the man said, “that’s just what I was going for. It was on the tip of my tongue. Panache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re probably wondering what this is all about.” Keller shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figure more will be revealed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat drew a smile. “A cool customer,” the fellow said. “Well, I’m not surprised.” His hand dipped into the front of his suit jacket, and Keller braced himself with both hands on the edge of the table, waiting to see the hand come out with a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead the hand emerged clutching a flat leather wallet, which the man flipped open to disclose an ID. The photo matched the face across the table from Keller, and the accompanying card identified the face as that of one Roger Keith Bascomb, an operative of something called the National Security Resource.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller handed the ID back to its owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Bascomb said. “You were all set to flip the table on me, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind. You’re alert, which is all to the good. And I’m not surprised. I know who you are, and I knowwhat you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a man trying to eat his breakfast,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a man who’s evidently not put off by all that scary stuff about cholesterol. Salami and eggs! I have to say I admire you, Keller. I bet that’s real coffee, too, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not great,” Keller said, “but it’s the genuine article.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My breakfast’s an oat bran muffin,” Bascomb said, “and I wash it down with decaf. But I didn’t come here to put in a bid for sympathy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as well, Keller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to make this overly dramatic,” Bascomb said, “but it’s hard to avoid. Mr. Keller, your country has need of your services.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My country?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The United States of America.That country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My services?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The very sort of services you rode down to Washington prepared to perform. I think we both know what sort of services I’m talking about.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-33.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
