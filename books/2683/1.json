Glares targeted at Peyton and JD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the f**k is Moi?\" I ask. \"I have no f**king idea who this Moi is, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, please,\" Peyton says. \"I\u0027m sure Damien went over this with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien did, JD. Damien did, Peyton. But just tell me who Moi is, baby,\" I exclaim. \"Because I\u0027m, like, shvitzing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moi is Peyton, Victor,\" JD says quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Moi,\" Peyton says, nodding. \"Moi is, um, French.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure these specks aren\u0027t supposed to be here?\" JD tentatively touches the panel. \"I mean, maybe it\u0027s supposed to be, oh, I don\u0027t know, in or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" I raise a hand. \"You\u0027re saying these specks are in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor-we\u0027ve got a long list of things to check, baby.\" JD holds up the long list of things to check. \"The specks will be taken care of. Someone will escort the specks out of here. There\u0027s a magician waiting downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By tomorrow night?\" I roar. \"By to-mor-row night, JD?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be handled by tomorrow, no?\" JD looks at Peyton, who nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Around here, `tomorrow night\u0027 means anywhere from five days to a month.

Do you need someone to decipher that sentence for you, JD, or are you, y\u0027know, okay with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"reporter\" from Details stands with us. Assignment: follow me around for a week. Headline: THE MAKING OF A CLUB. Girl: push-up bra, scads of eyeliner, a Soviet sailor\u0027s cap, plastic flower jewelry, rolled-up copy of W tucked under a pale, worked-out arm. Uma Thurman if Uma Thurman was five feet two and asleep. Behind her, some guy wearing a Velcro vest over a rugby shirt and a leather windjammer follows us, camcording the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey baby.\" I inhale on a Marlboro someone\u0027s handed me. \"What do you think about the specks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirl reporter lowers her sunglasses. \"I\u0027m really not sure.\" She thinks about what position she should take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"East Coast girls are hip,\" I shrug. \"I really dig those styles they wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m really part of the story,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think any of these bozos are?\" I snort. \"Spare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the top floor, Beau leans over the railing and calls down, \"Victor-Chloe\u0027s on line ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirl reporter immediately lifts the W, revealing a notepad, on which she doodles something, predictably animated for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI call up, staring intently at the specks: \"Tell her I\u0027m busy. I\u0027m in a meeting. It\u0027s an emergency. Tell her I\u0027m in a meeting and it\u0027s an emergency.

They glow. They\u0027re glowing, JD,\" I whisper. \"Jesus, they\u0027re everywhere.\" Suddenly I notice an entire new patch and yelp, gaping, \"And I think they\u0027re spreading. I don\u0027t think that patch was here before? I swallow, then croak in a rush, \"My mouth is incredibly dry because of this-could someone get me an Arizona diet iced tea in a bottle, not a can?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-1.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
