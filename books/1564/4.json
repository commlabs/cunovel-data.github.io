Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day\u0027s shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woolen balaclava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (\"It\u0027s a lunascope, old boy -- no more messing around with moon charts, see?\") or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\"Personally, I won\u0027t let any of the children out alone until he\u0027s back in Azkaban\"). Harry didn\u0027t have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue\u0027s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player\u0027s face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry\u0027s resolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he\u0027d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just come out -- prototype --\" a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the fastest broom in the world, isn\u0027t it, Dad?\" squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irish International Side\u0027s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!\" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. \"And they\u0027re favorites for the World Cup!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e** THE FIREBOLT **\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIS STATE-OF-THE-ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HAND-NUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrice on request...Harry didn\u0027t like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn\u0027t ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin\u0027s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hogwarts?\" he said abruptly. \"Come to get your new books?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"I need --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of the way,\" said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books\u0027 cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\u0027ve already got one of those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you?\" A look of enormous relief spread over the manager\u0027s face. \"Thank heavens for that. I\u0027ve been bitten five times already this morning --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a third and were pulling it apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! Stop it!\" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart. \"I\u0027m never stocking them again, never! It\u0027s been bedlam! I thought we\u0027d seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -- cost a fortune, and we never found them...Well...is there anything else I can help you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Harry, looking down his booklist, \"I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, starting Divination, are you?\" said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you are,\" said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick, black-bound book. \"Unfogging the Future. Very good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods -- palmistry, crystal balls, bird entrails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Harry wasn\u0027t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which was among a display on a small table: Death Omens -- What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t read that if I were you,\" said the manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was staring at. \"You\u0027ll start seeing death omens everywhere. It\u0027s enough to frighten anyone to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog\u0027s and dazedly consulting his booklist. \"Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t have been a death omen,\" he told his reflection defiantly. \"I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent...It was probably just a stray dog....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fighting a losing battle there, dear,\" said his mirror in a wheezy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn\u0027t stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he\u0027d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he\u0027d have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry! HARRY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue\u0027s Ice Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally!\" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \"We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you\u0027d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin\u0027s, and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got all my school stuff last week,\" Harry explained. \"And how come you knew I\u0027m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" said Ron simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?\" said Hermione in a very serious voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to,\" said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. \"I just -- lost control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not funny, Ron,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Honestly, I\u0027m amazed Harry wasn\u0027t expelled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested.\" He looked at Ron. \"Your dad doesn\u0027t know why Fudge let me off, does he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably \u0027cause it\u0027s you, isn\u0027t it?\" shrugged Ron, still chuckling. \"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I\u0027d hate to see what the Ministry\u0027d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they\u0027d have to dig me up first, because Mum would\u0027ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We\u0027re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King\u0027s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione\u0027s there as well!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione nodded, beaming. \"Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent!\" said Harry happily. \"So, have you got all your new books and stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at this,\" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. \"Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we\u0027ve got all our books --\" He pointed at a large bag under his chair. \"What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s all that, Hermione?\" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m taking more new subjects than you, aren\u0027t I,\" said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?\" said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. \"You\u0027re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,\" said Hermione earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\" asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve still got ten Galleons,\" she said, checking her purse. \"It\u0027s my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry\u0027s got Hedwig and you\u0027ve got Errol --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t,\" said Ron. \"Errol\u0027s a family owl. All I\u0027ve got is Scabbers.\" He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked over,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I don\u0027t think Egypt agreed with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a magical creature shop just over there,\" said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. \"You could see if they\u0027ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my rat,\" he told the witch. \"He\u0027s been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from Egypt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bang him on the counter,\" said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron\u0027s brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What powers does he have?\" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er --\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch\u0027s eyes moved from Scabbers\u0027s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been through the mill, this one,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\" said Ron defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can\u0027t be expected to live longer than three years or so,\" said the witch. \"Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, \"Show-offs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you don\u0027t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\" said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Ron. \"How much -- OUCH!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\" cried the witch, but Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scabbers!\" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Hermione?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably getting her owl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn\u0027t carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gorgeous, isn\u0027t he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat\u0027s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Scabbers?\" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. \"He needs rest and relaxation! How\u0027s he going to get it with that thing around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron\u0027s hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what\u0027s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he\u0027d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily Prophet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\" he said, smiling as he looked up. \"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with their shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They still haven\u0027t caught him, then?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They\u0027ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It\u0027d be good to get some more money --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \"Black\u0027s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It\u0027s the Azkaban guards who\u0027ll get him back, You mark my words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys\" youngest child and only girl, Ginny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered \"hello\" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, \"Harry. How nice to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Percy,\" said Harry, trying not to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you\u0027re well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, thanks --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. \"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marvelous,\" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry\u0027s hand in turn. \"Absolutely spiffing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough, now,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mum!\" said Fred, as though he\u0027d only just spotted her and seizing her hand, too. \"How really corking to see you --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, that\u0027s enough,\" said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair. \"Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you\u0027ve heard our exciting news?\" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy\u0027s chest. \"Second Head Boy in the family!\" she said, swelling with pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And last,\" Fred muttered under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t doubt that,\" said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \"I notice they haven\u0027t made you two prefects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we want to be prefects for?\" said George, looking revolted at the very idea. \"It\u0027d take all the fun out of life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to set a better example for your sister!\" snapped Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gunny\u0027s got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,\" said Percy loftily. \"I\u0027m going up to change for dinner...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027re we getting to King\u0027s Cross tomorrow, Dad?\" asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Ministry\u0027s providing a couple of cars,\" said Mr. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" said Percy curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s because of you, Perce,\" said George seriously. \"And there\u0027ll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-- for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?\" Percy asked again, in a dignified voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, as we haven\u0027t got one anymore,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"and as I work there, they\u0027re doing me a favor...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was casual, but Harry couldn\u0027t help noticing that Mr. Wesley\u0027s ears had gone red, just like Ron\u0027s did when he was under pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good thing, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley briskly. \"Do you realize how much luggage you\u0027ve all got between you? A nice sight you\u0027d be on the Muggle Underground...You are all packed, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron hasn\u0027t put all his new things in his trunk yet,\" said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. \"He\u0027s dumped them on my bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won\u0027t have much time in the morning,\" Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t touched it, all right?\" Ron roared back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Head Boy badge is gone,\" said Percy, rounding on Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\u0027s Scabbers\u0027s Rat Tonic,\" said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look. \"I think I might\u0027ve left it in the bar --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going anywhere till you\u0027ve found my badge!\" yelled Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get Scabbers\u0027s stuff, I\u0027m packed,\" Harry said to Ron, and he went downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys\". He hesitated, not wanting them to know he\u0027d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...makes no sense not to tell him,\" Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \"Harry\u0027s got a right to know. I\u0027ve tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He\u0027s thirteen years old and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \"Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven\u0027s sake, he\u0027s happy not knowing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\" retorted Mr. Weasley. \"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves -- they\u0027ve ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But Harry mustn\u0027t do that this year! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn\u0027t picked him up, I\u0027m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not dead, he\u0027s fine, so what\u0027s the point --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly, they say Sirius Black\u0027s mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban, and that\u0027s supposed to be impossible. It\u0027s been three weeks, and no one\u0027s seen hide nor hair of him, and I don\u0027t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we\u0027re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black\u0027s after --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no one\u0027s really sure that Black\u0027s after Harry --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn\u0027t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: \"He\u0027s at Hogwarts...he\u0027s at Hogwarts.\" Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he\u0027s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you\u0027re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don\u0027t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore\u0027s Headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn\u0027t happy about it, but he agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not happy? Why shouldn\u0027t he be happy, if they\u0027re there to catch Black?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore isn\u0027t fond of the Azkaban guards,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Nor am I, if it comes to that...but when you\u0027re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you\u0027d rather avoid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they save Harry --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"¨C then I will never say another word against them, said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"It\u0027s late, Molly, we\u0027d better go up...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Wesley\u0027s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron\u0027s room in search of his badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got it,\" Fred whispered to Harry. \"We\u0027ve been improving it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe badge now read Bighead Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He\u0027d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn\u0027t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs., Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn\u0027t people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort\u0027s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black\u0027s chances of getting inside seemed very remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn\u0027t look after himself? He\u0027d escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn\u0027t completely useless....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to be murdered,\" Harry said out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the spirit, dear,\" said his mirror sleepily. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-4.html","bookId":1564,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:34 PM"}
