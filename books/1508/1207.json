The room was extremely simple with only a single stone bed in the center. A white-haired youth sat cross-legged on the stone bed. A large red snake was wrapped around him. This red snake had a single horn on its head. It was a high level contract beast known as a unicorn dragon. As for Senior-apprentice Brother Highdragon’s nickname, it was because of this giant snake.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I greet Senior-apprentice Brother Highdragon.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe dark-skinned youth bowed.

But, as the dark-skinned youth heard that Highdragon would only help once, he was a bit unwilling as he said, “Senior-apprentice Brother Highdragon, killing him just one time is going too easy on him. We did think that he was the type that we could bully, but afterwards, when us brothers argued with him and said that we came from the True Martial Holy Lands, that boy only responded with a few words. He said, in his exact words, ‘I’m missing some merit points right now, so if you people are planning on delivering some snacks to me then go ahead, I’ll welcome all of you’. I can make an oath on my heart of martial arts that he said these words. I’m not exaggerating at all!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHighdragon frowned, his face darkening. “He said that he wants the disciples of my True Martial Holy Lands to deliver merit points to him?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s completely true! The way he acted was far too arrogant, he simply doesn’t place our True Martial Holy Lands in his eyes!” The dark-skinned youth hurriedly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I see.” Highdragon stood up, his eyes narrowing.

He knew that Highdragon had finally been moved to a killing anger. This Senior-apprentice Brother Highdragon was usually a quiet man of few words, but once he was angered, the consequences were dire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Where is he?” Highdragon tersely asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He should still be at Demon Sealing Ridge…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHighdragon no longer spoke.

Although he has slowed down, he is still steadily rising. It’s only rising, not falling at all!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s position had originally fallen down to around rank 296,000; he had been about to fall off the Divine Seal Decree altogether. Qin Xingxuan had been worried for him, but now his ranking had risen to 280,000.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis left Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu overjoyed. Mu Qianyu had also been the one to assure Qin Xingxuan that Lin Ming’s ranking would undoubtedly rise. The higher Lin Ming’s results were, the greater importance the Unbroken Cult would place on him and the easier it would be for them to meet Lin Ming again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu said, “When Lin Ming’s ranking rose by 8000, that should be because he killed some participants. But now that the speed of his rising has slowed down, that should be because he is killing nightmare beasts instead! If this continues, then Lin Ming will slowly return to the top 30,000 rankings.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming killed the dark-skinned youth and his five companions, he had obtained over a million merit points from them. But, the dark-skinned youth and the others weren’t ranked on the Divine Sea Decree and their merit points weren’t very high to begin with. Thus, even though Lin Ming had killed six of them, he still didn’t rise by much.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fact, in these past two months, there were many higher ranked participants who had an absurdly high number of merit points. The difference between them and Lin Ming was simply ridiculous.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hahaha! I said that with Young Hero Lin’s ability, he absolutely would not continue falling. I don’t know why, but for some strange reason Young Hero Lin waits until the final moments to move. But, as long as he moves he is amazing! Once Young Hero Lin puts in a bit more effort, his position will definitely rise. We just spoke a little bit and yet Young Hero Lin’s ranking has risen by over a dozen. According to this speed, he’ll be able to rise by 10,000-20,000 every day. With another month remaining, he will definitely rise back to the top 30,000 rankings. He might even rise to the top 20,000 rankings, haha!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Unbroken Cult’s Elder heartily laughed. “Two misses, there is no need to worry. Once the preliminaries end, Young Hero Lin will be brought over to where the semifinals will be held. At that time, I will personally escort you two to meet Young Hero Lin. The semifinals only have 10 million people participating. With Young Hero Lin’s results, finding him will definitely be easy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Thank you, Great Elder. Us disciples, as well as our husband, will surely remember this graciousness.” Mu Qianyu sincerely said. She was well aware that the reason the Great Elder was doing all of this was because of Lin Ming. Thus, she mentioned Lin Ming to reassure the Great Elder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Great Elder heard Mu Qianyu speak, he stroked his beard, a wide smile crossing his face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDivine Dream World, Demon Sealing Ridge –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn a black mountain hundreds of times harder than steel, massive cracks dotted the landscape as if some giant beast had taken bites out of the mountain. Countless corpses of nightmare beasts fell from the sky, littering the land. They slowly dissipated, vanishing into pure energy that was absorbed by Lin Ming. There was nothing left behind but the rancid smell of blood that couldn’t seem to be washed away. A coppery tang filled the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The energy of these ordinary nightmare beasts really isn’t enough.

He closed his eyes and all the powerful nightmare beasts and participants for a hundred miles appeared within his mind. He chose the direction with the highest concentration of energy and then his body flashed as he flew over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA blue beam of light cut through the skies.

There were some martial artists that didn’t place Lin Ming in their eyes and wanted to deal with him, but the end result was that all of them were cleanly killed off by him instead.
