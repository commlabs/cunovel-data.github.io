{"id":34397,"no":1,"title":"PREFATORY NOTE","content":"This little book leans much, as every modern work on the subject must do, upon Mr. Richard Simpsonâ€™s monograph: Edmund Campion, Jesuit Protomartyr of England. In many points supplementing or contradicting that splendid though biased narrative, the present writer has gratefully taken advantage of the researches of the Rev. John Hungerford Pollen, S.J. It may also be useful to state that the contemporary citations, when not otherwise specified, are from two invaluable witnesses, Parsons and Allen. The translated passages have been compared with the originals, and sometimes newly rendered.  \n\u003cbr\u003e St. Ives, Cornwall: Epiphany, 1908.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1616/47839.html","bookId":1234,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:37:46 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:37:46 AM"}
