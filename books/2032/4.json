I can\u0027t explain right now. Let\u0027s just get him home, all right? He\u0027s wet and freezing out here. Then we can discuss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job of getting Stefan through the woods was enough to occupy everyone\u0027s mind for a while. He remained unconscious, and when they finally laid him out in the back seat of Matt\u0027s car they were all bruised and exhausted, in addition to being wet from the contact with his soaking clothes. Elena held his head in her lap as they drove to the boarding house. Meredith and Bonnie followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena gently eased Stefan\u0027s head down and slipped out of the car, and saw one of the windows in the house brighten as a curtain was pushed aside. Then she saw a head and shoulders appear at the window, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Flowers!\" she called, waving. \"It\u0027s Elena Gilbert, Mrs. Flowers. We\u0027ve found Stefan, and we need to get in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure at the window did not move or otherwise acknowledge her words. Yet from its posture, Elena could tell it was still looking down on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Flowers, we have Stefan,\" she called again, gesturing to the lighted interior of the car. \"Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena! It\u0027s unlocked already!\" Bonnie\u0027s voice floated to her from the front porch, distracting Elena from the figure at the window. When she looked back up, she saw the curtains falling into place, and then the light in that upstairs room snapped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was strange, but she had no time to puzzle over it. She and Meredith helped Matt lift Stefan and carry him up the front steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the house was dark and still. Elena directed the others up the staircase that stood opposite the door, and onto the second-floor landing. From there they went into a bedroom, and Elena had Bonnie open the door of what looked like a closet. It revealed another stairway, very dim and narrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who would leave their - front door unlocked - after all that\u0027s happened recently?\" Matt grunted as they hauled their lifeless burden. \"She must be crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheis crazy,\" Bonnie said from above, pushing the door at the top of the staircase open. \"Last time we were here she talked about the weirdest - \" Her voice broke off in a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" said Elena. But as they reached the threshold of Stefan\u0027s room, she saw for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d forgotten the condition the room had been in the last time she\u0027d seen it. Trunks filled with clothing were upended or lying on their sides, as if they\u0027d been thrown by some giant hand from wall to wall. Their contents were strewn about the floor, along with articles from the dresser and tables. Furniture was overturned, and a window was broken, allowing a cold wind to blow in. There was only one lamp on, in a corner, and grotesque shadows loomed against the ceiling. \"What happened?\" said Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena didn\u0027t answer until they had stretched Stefan out on the bed. \"I don\u0027t know for certain,\" she said, and this was true, if just barely. \"But it was already this way last night. Matt, will you help me? He needs to get dry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find another lamp,\" said Meredith, but Elena spoke quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we can see all right. Why don\u0027t you try to get a fire going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpilling from one of the gaping trunks was a terry cloth robe of some dark color. Elena took it, and she and Matt began to strip off Stefan\u0027s wet and clinging clothes. She worked on getting his sweater off, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, could you - could you hand me that towel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he turned, she tugged the sweater over Stefan\u0027s head and quickly wrapped the robe around him. When Matt turned back and handed her the towel, she wound it around Stefan\u0027s throat like a scarf. Her pulse was racing, her mind working furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder he was so weak, so lifeless. Oh, God. She had to examine him, to see how bad it was. But how could she, with Matt and the others here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get a doctor,\" Matt said in a tight voice, his eyes on Stefan\u0027s face. \"He needs help, Elena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena panicked. \"Matt, no... please. He - he\u0027s afraid of doctors. I don\u0027t know what would happen if you brought one here.\" Again, it was the truth, if not the whole truth. She had an idea of what might help Stefan, but she couldn\u0027t do it with the others there. She bent over Stefan, rubbing his hands between her own, trying to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could she do? Protect Stefan\u0027s secret at the cost of his life? Or betray him in order to save him? Would it save him to tell Matt and Bonnie and Meredith? She looked at her friends, trying to picture their response if they were to learn the truth about Stefan Salvatore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no good. She couldn\u0027t risk it. The shock and horror of the discovery had nearly sent Elena herself reeling into madness. If she, who loved Stefan, had been ready to run from him screaming, what would these three do? And then there was Mr. Tanner\u0027s murder. If they knew what Stefan was, would they ever be able to believe him innocent? Or, in their heart of hearts, would they always suspect him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena shut her eyes. It was just too dangerous. Meredith and Bonnie and Matt were her friends, but this was one thing she couldn\u0027t share with them. In all the world, there was no one she could trust with this secret. She would have to keep it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened up and looked at Matt. \"He\u0027s afraid of doctors, but a nurse might be all right.\" She turned to where Bonnie and Meredith were kneeling before the fireplace. \"Bonnie, what about your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary?\" Bonnie glanced at her watch. \"She has the late shift at the clinic this week, but she\u0027s probably home by now. Only - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then that\u0027s it. Matt, you go with Bonnie and ask Mary to come here and look at Stefan. If she thinks he needs a doctor, I won\u0027t argue any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt hesitated, then exhaled sharply. \"All right. I still think you\u0027re wrong, but - let\u0027s go, Bonnie. We\u0027re going to break some traffic laws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they went to the door, Meredith remained standing by the fireplace, watching Elena with steady dark eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena made herself meet them. \"Meredith... I think you should all go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" Those dark eyes remained on hers unwaveringly, as if trying to pierce through and read her mind. But Meredith did not ask any other questions. After a moment she nodded, and followed Matt and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Elena heard the door at the bottom of the staircase close, she hastily righted a lamp that lay overturned by the bedside and plugged it in. Now, at last, she could take stock of Stefan\u0027s injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis color seemed worse than before; he was literally almost as white as the sheets below him. His lips were white, too, and Elena suddenly thought of Thomas Fell, the founder of Fell\u0027s Church. Or, rather, of Thomas Fell\u0027s statue, lying beside his wife\u0027s on the stone lid of their tomb. Stefan was the color of that marble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cuts and gashes on his hands showed livid purple, but they were no longer bleeding. She gently turned his head to look at his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was. She touched the side of her own neck automatically, as if to verify the resemblance. But Stefan\u0027s marks were not small punctures. They were deep, savage tears in the flesh. He looked as if he had been mauled by some animal that had tried to rip out his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-hot anger blazed through Elena again. And with it, hatred. She realized that despite her disgust and fury, she had not really hated Damon before. Not really. But now... now, shehated. She loathed him with an intensity of emotion that she had never felt for anyone else in her life. She wanted to hurt him, to make him pay. If she\u0027d had a wooden stake at that moment, she would have hammered it through Damon\u0027s heart without regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just now she had to think of Stefan. He was so terrifyingly still. That was the hardest thing to bear, the lack of purpose or resistance in his body, the emptiness. That was it. It was as if he had vacated this form and left her with an empty vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan!\" Shaking him did nothing. With one hand on the center of his cold chest, she tried to detect a heartbeat. If there was one, it was too faint to feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep calm, Elena, she told herself, pushing back the part of her mind that wanted to panic. The part that was saying, \"What if he\u0027s dead? What if he\u0027s really dead, and nothing you can do will save him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing about the room, she saw the broken window. Shards of glass lay on the floor beneath it. She went over and picked one up, noting how it sparkled in the firelight. A pretty thing, with an edge like a razor, she thought. Then, deliberately, setting her teeth, she cut her finger with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain made her gasp. After an instant, blood began welling out of the cut, dripping down her finger like wax down a candlestick. Quickly, she knelt by Stefan and put her finger to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her other hand, she clasped his unresponsive one, feeling the hardness of the silver ring he wore. Motionless as a statue herself, she knelt there and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost missed the first tiny flicker of response. Her eyes were fixed on his face, and she caught the minute lifting of his chest only in her peripheral vision. But then the lips beneath her finger quivered and parted slightly, and he swallowed reflexively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Elena whispered. \"Come on, Stefan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyelashes fluttered, and with dawning joy she felt his fingers return the pressure of hers. He swallowed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose green eyes were dazed and heavy, but as stubborn as she had ever seen them. \"No,\" Stefan said, his voice a cracked whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to, Stefan. The others are coming back and bringing a nurse with them. I had to agree to that. And if you\u0027re not well enough to convince her you don\u0027t need a hospital...\" She left the sentence unfinished. She herself didn\u0027t know what a doctor or lab technician would find examining Stefan. But she knew he knew, and that it made him afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Stefan only looked more obstinate, turning his face away from her. \"Can\u0027t,\" he whispered. \"It\u0027s too dangerous. Already took... too much... last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it have been only last night? It seemed a year ago. \"Will it kill me?\" she asked. \"Stefan, answer me! Will it kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\" His voice was sullen. \"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we have to do it. Don\u0027t argue with me!\" Bending over him, holding his hand in hers, Elena could feel his overpowering need. She was amazed that he was even trying to resist. It was like a starving man standing before a banquet, unable to take his eyes from the steaming dishes, but refusing to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Stefan said again, and Elena felt frustration surge through her. He was the only person she\u0027d ever met who was as stubborn as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And if you won\u0027t cooperate I\u0027ll cut something else, like my wrist.\" She had been pressing her finger into the sheet to staunch the blood; now she held it up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pupils dilated, his lips parted. \"Too much... already,\" he murmured, but his gaze remained on her finger, on the bright drop of blood at the tip. \"And I can\u0027t... control...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" she whispered. She drew the finger across his lips again, feeling them open to take it in; then, she leaned over him and shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth was cool and dry as it touched her throat. His hand cupped the back of her neck as his lips sought the two little punctures already there. Elena willed herself not to recoil at the brief sting of pain. Then she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, she had felt his agonizing need, his driving hunger. Now, through the bond they shared, she felt only fierce joy and satisfaction. Deep satisfaction as the hunger was gradually assuaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer own pleasure came from giving, from knowing that she was sustaining Stefan with her own life. She could sense the strength flowing into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn time, she felt the intensity of the need lessen. Still, it was by no means gone, and she could not understand when Stefan tried to push her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough,\" he grated, forcing her shoulders up. Elena opened her eyes, her dreamy pleasure broken. His own eyes were green as mandrake leaves, and in his face she saw the fierce hunger of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t enough. You\u0027re still weak - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s enough foryou. \" He pushed at her again, and she saw something like desperation spark in those green eyes. \"Elena, if I take much more, you will begin to change. And if you don\u0027t move away, if you don\u0027t move away from meright now ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena withdrew to the foot of the bed. She watched him sit up and adjust the dark robe. In the lamplight, she saw that his skin had regained some color, a slight flush glazing its pallor. His hair was drying into a tumbled sea of dark waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you,\" she said softly. Relief throbbed within her suddenly, an ache that was almost as bad as the fear and tension had been. Stefan was alive; he was talking to her. Everything was going to be all right after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena...\" Their eyes met and she was held by green fire. Unconsciously, she moved toward him, and then stopped as he laughed aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen you look like this before,\" he said, and she looked down at herself. Her shoes and jeans were caked with red mud, which was also liberally smeared over the rest of her. Her jacket was torn and leaking its down stuffing. She had no doubt that her face was smudged and dirty, and sheknew her hair was tangled and straggly. Elena Gilbert, immaculate fashion plate of Robert E. Lee, was a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it,\" Stefan said, and this time she laughed with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still laughing as the door opened. Elena stiffened alertly, twitching at her turtleneck, glancing around the room for evidence that might betray them. Stefan sat up straighter and licked his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s better!\" Bonnie caroled out as she stepped into the room and saw Stefan. Matt and Meredith were right behind her, and their faces lit with surprise and pleasure. The fourth person who came in was only a little older than Bonnie, but she had an air of brisk authority that belied her youth. Mary McCullough went straight over to her patient and reached for his pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re the one afraid of doctors,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan looked disconcerted for a moment; then, he recovered. \"It\u0027s sort of a childhood phobia,\" he said, sounding embarrassed. He glanced sideways at Elena, who smiled nervously and gave a tiny nod. \"Anyway, I don\u0027t need one now, as you can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you let me be the judge of that? Your pulse is all right. In fact, it\u0027s surprisingly slow, even for an athlete. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re hypothermic, but you\u0027re still chilled. Let\u0027s get a temperature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I really don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary.\" Stefan\u0027s voice was low, calming. Elena had heard him use that voice before, and she knew what he was trying to do. But Mary took not the slightest notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open up, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, I\u0027ll do it,\" said Elena quickly, reaching to take the thermometer from Mary. Somehow, as she did so, the little glass tube slipped out of her hand. It fell to the hardwood floor and smashed into several pieces. Uh, I\u0027m sorry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027re not dangerously ill. I can\u0027tmake you go to the clinic. But I\u0027d strongly suggest you get a checkup tomorrow.\" \"Thank you,\" said Stefan, which, Elena noticed, was not the same as agreeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena,you look as if you could use a doctor,\" said Bonnie. \"You\u0027re white as a ghost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just tired,\" Elena said. \"It\u0027s been a long day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My advice is to go home and go to bed - and stay there,\" Mary said. \"You\u0027re not anemic, are you?\" Elena resisted the impulse to put a hand to her cheek. Was she so pale? \"No, I\u0027m just tired,\" she repeated. \"We can go home now, if Stefan\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded reassuringly, the message in his eyes for her alone. \"Give us a minute, will you?\" he said to Mary and the others, and they stepped back to the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye. Take care of yourself,\" Elena said aloud as she hugged him. She whispered, \"Why didn\u0027t you use your Powers on Mary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" he said grimly in her ear. \"Or at least I tried. I must still be weak. Don\u0027t worry; it\u0027ll pass. \"Of course, it will,\" said Elena, but her stomach lurched. \"Are you sure you should be alone, though? What if - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine. You\u0027re the one who shouldn\u0027t be alone.\" Stefan\u0027s voice was soft but urgent. \"Elena, I didn\u0027t get a chance to warn you. You were right about Damon being in Fell\u0027s Church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. He did this to you, didn\u0027t he?\" Elena didn\u0027t mention that she\u0027d gone searching for him. \"I - don\u0027t remember. But he\u0027s dangerous. Keep Bonnie and Meredith with you tonight, Elena. I don\u0027t want you alone. And make sure no one invites a stranger into your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going straight to bed,\" Elena promised, smiling at him. \"We won\u0027t be inviting anybody in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure of it.\" There was no flippancy in his tone at all, and she nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand, Stefan. We\u0027ll be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" They kissed, a mere brushing of lips, but their joined hands separated only reluctantly. \"Tell the and Meredith could go back with Elena. Mary was still clearly suspicious about the night\u0027s goings-on, and Elena couldn\u0027t blame her. She also couldn\u0027t think. She was too tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said to say \u0027thanks\u0027 to all of you,\" she remembered after Matt had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s... welcome,\" Bonnie said, splitting the words with an enormous yawn as Meredith opened the car door for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith said nothing. She had been very quiet since leaving Elena alone with Stefan. Bonnie laughed suddenly. \"One thing we all forgot about,\" she said. \"The prophecy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What prophecy?\" said Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the bridge. The one you say I said. Well, you went to the bridge and Death wasn\u0027t waiting there after all. Maybe you misunderstood the words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Meredith. \"We heard the words correctly all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, maybe it\u0027s another bridge. Or... mmm...\" Bonnie snuggled down in her coat, shutting her eyes, and didn\u0027t bother to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Elena\u0027s mind completed the sentence for her.Or another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn owl hooted outside as Meredith started the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-4.html","bookId":2032,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:47 PM"}
