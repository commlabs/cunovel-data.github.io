However, the tremendous force his body possessed caused Madeline to stagger backward, and then the heavy sword was moved to the side.

His knee smashed into the sword’s hilt, thus causing the heavy sword to leave her hand and insert itself into the ground several dozen meters away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe burden of this forceful movement on Sousa’s body was clearly quite heavy as well.
