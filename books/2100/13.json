Like a square-that was her grandfather\u0027s basement. Steps, going out of the top of the picture up to the house. A desk against one wall. A couch. Three or four large bookcases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all she could remember. She hoped it was enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing over her shoulder, she saw that Julian was gone again. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the slip of paper on the floor in front of the blank wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flash of light was exactly like a flashgun going off in her eyes, leaving her with dancing afterimages. Score one for Zach, she thought. When she could see again, she found herself looking in a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel her pulse in her wrists and throat as well as her chest. God, don\u0027t let me run away, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter so many years of fighting not to remember this, she was going to throw herself right into it. It was going to be bad. How bad, she\u0027d have to find out when it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed the red button. The blue light went on. The mirrored door slid open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t give herself a chance to look at anything before she stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden sunlight slanted in from small windows set high on the walls. To Jenny\u0027s utter surprise she felt a thrill of excitement and recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember those windows! I remember...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slid shut behind her, but she was already stepping out to the center of the room, looking around in wonder. Taking in the colors, the profusion of objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s smaller than I thought it would be-and even more crowded. But it\u0027s my grandfather\u0027s basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandfather, though, wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right. He wasn\u0027t here that day. I remember. I let myself in the house and went looking for him, but I couldn\u0027t find him anywhere upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ... I looked down here-I think. I must have. I don\u0027t remember doing it, but I must have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny turned toward the stairs, which ended in a blank wall at the top. No door, of course, because this was a nightmare. The wall was as blank as her mind-her sense of delighted recognition had stopped cold. She had no idea what came next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as she stared, she seemed to see the ghost of a child looking down from the top step. A little girl wearing shorts, with wind-ruffled hair and a scab on her knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerself. At age five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost like watching a movie. She could see the little girl\u0027s thongs flap as she ran down the stairs. She could see the child\u0027s lips open as she called for her grandfather, see the child standing in surprise at the bottom when he turned out not to be down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as Jenny watched without trying to guide the images, the ghostly movie went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl was looking around, green eyes opening wide as she realized that she was alone down here, a thing which had never happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right. The door to the basement had always been locked when Jenny\u0027s grandfather wasn\u0027t down there-but not that day. Jenny remembered the feeling of delicious wickedness at being where she wasn\u0027t allowed to be. But she couldn\u0027t remember what happened next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t try to remember. You\u0027re trying too hard. Relax and see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she did, she seemed to see the little girl again. The ghostly image was standing uncertainly, swaying on her toes, considering whether to stay or go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was stay. The child looked around with elaborate casualness, then, sucking on her lower lip and affecting an air of nonchalance, she wandered over to the first bookcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, Jenny thought. So let\u0027s see what\u0027s in the bookcase. She followed the child\u0027s image. The little girl was idly running a grimy finger along a row of books-which, of course, she couldn\u0027t read. Not even the titles. But sixteen-year-old Jenny could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them looked fairly normal, like Goethe\u0027s Faust and UFO\u0027s: A New Look. But others were completely unfamiliar, like The Qabalah and De Occulta Philosophia and The Galdrabdk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl was moving on to the second bookcase, which held all sorts of objects. One whole shelf was crowded with small wooden boxes with glass tops, filled with what looked like spices. No-herbs, Jenny thought. Dried herbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl was running fascinated fingers over some balls of colored glass attached to strings. Sixteen-year-old Jenny was more interested in the looped cross next to them-she was sure it was an ankh. Summer\u0027s dad had said the ankh was an Egyptian life symbol that kept away bad luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that diamond-shaped thing made of yarn-that was a Mexican Eye of God. A string design that was supposed to protect you from evil. Jenny\u0027s mother had one in the kitchen, for decoration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what about the bracelet of cobalt and turquoise beads, alternating with little silver charms? And the gold-plated religious pictures? And the wooden flute wrapped in fur?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... items of protection? Jenny thought. She wasn\u0027t sure what put the idea in her mind, but the longer she looked at the things in this bookcase, the more certain she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut... it wasn\u0027t just this bookcase. Slowly Jenny turned to look around the basement again. All these things, all these beautiful, exotic things-could they all be for protection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would need that much protection? And why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl was fingering a large silver bell in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebookcase, but Jenny\u0027s eyes were drawn to a group of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echarts on the wall. The Theban Alphabet, one was labeled, and underneath were strange symbols. The Alphabet of the Magi. The Secret Etruscan Alphabet. The Celtic Tree Alphabet. Numerical Values of the Hebrew Alphabet. There was also a rather frightening engraving of a skeleton holding a raven on one bony hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost child was moving again, wandering over to the large writing desk. Going on tiptoe in her thongs, she leaned her elbows on the felt desk pad. Jenny found herself looking down through a transparent blond head at the papers there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of papers-which held no interest for the five-year-old Jenny except that she wasn\u0027t supposed to touch them. Intrinsic naughtiness was the fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixteen-year-old Jenny could read them. One was a chart like those on the wall. It was titled The Elder Futhark but Jenny recognized the slanty, angular symbols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the ones she\u0027d seen on the drinking horns of the young men in the forest. Like the one on the inside cover of the white box. Each had its name written beside it in her grandfather\u0027s strong black handwriting, with notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUruz, she read. For piercing the veil between the worlds. She recognized the inverted V shape, the two uneven horns pointing downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaidho-it was shaped like an R drawn without any curved lines-for journeying in space or time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDagaz, which looked like an hourglass on its side. For awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the runes was circled with a thick pen stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNauthiz, Jenny read. Shaped like a backward-leaning X, with one stroke longer than the other. For containment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last word was underlined heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny took another slow look around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t keep the truth away any longer. She\u0027d been holding it at arm\u0027s length, refusing to look at it, but now it burst on her with the force of absolute certainty. There was no way to deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God, he was a sorcerer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother\u0027s father had been a sorcerer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t think about it... don\u0027t remember, the voice in her mind whispered. Nobody can make you remember. Stay safe behind your walls, or else ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be very bad from here on, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to remember-for Tom. But Tom\u0027s image eluded her. So much had happened since she\u0027d seen him last night-could it only be last night? She\u0027d changed so much since then. She tried to conjure up his rakish smile in her mind, his green-flecked eyes, but the picture she got was like a distant, faded photograph. Somebody she\u0027d known long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I can\u0027t get any feeling for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer palms were tingling. Her stomach felt sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have to remember. For Dee. For Zach. For Audrey and Michael-and Summer. Yes. For Summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the others had faced their nightmares. Even Summer had tried. Pictures skittered through Jenny\u0027s mind: Dee thrashing like an animal; Audrey huddled and moaning; Michael screaming; Summer\u0027s blue-white lips; Zach\u0027s glazed gray eyes. They\u0027d all been terrified out of their wits. Was Jenny\u0027s nightmare any worse than theirs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I think so, the little voice in her mind whispered, but Jenny wasn\u0027t listening anymore. From Don\u0027t remember, don\u0027t remember, the chant in her head had changed to Remember, remember...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this will help, she told herself rather calmly, and with a feeling of meeting her doom she picked up a leather-bound book on the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a journal of sorts. Or at least a record of some kind of experiment. Her grandfather\u0027s heavy black writing degenerated into a scrawl in places, but certain sentences stood out clearly as she leafed through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... out of all the methods from different cultures this one seems safest... the rune Nyd or Nauthiz provides an eternal constraint, preventing travel in any direction.... The rune must be carved, then stained with blood, and finally charged with power by pronouncing its name aloud....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny flipped through more pages to a later entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... interesting treatise on the traditional methods of dealing with a djinn, or, as the Hausa call them, the aljunnu. Why anyone should think this could be accomplished with a bottle is beyond me.... I believe the space I\u0027ve prepared to be just barely sufficient for containing the tremendous energies involved... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood grief, he sounded just like a scientist. A mad scientist, Jenny thought. She flipped more pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... I have achieved the containment at last! I\u0027m very satisfied... foolproof methods... not the slightest danger... the tremendous forces I\u0027ve harnessed ... all in complete safety. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToward the end there was something stuck in between the pages like a bookmark. It was a torn sheet of yellowing, brittle paper. It looked very old. The writing on it was quite different from her grandfather\u0027s-thin and shaky-and part of it was obscured by rusty-brown stains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a poem. There was no title, but the author\u0027s name, Johannes Eckhart, and the date, 1943, were scrawled at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, slipping on the slime-edged stones, To that dark place by rusty foxfire lit, Where they lie watching, fingering old bones, Go with my question. Deep into the pit Of the Black Forest, where the Erlking rules And truth is told but always at a cost, I take my puzzle. Like the other fools who\u0027ve slipped on these same stones and played and lost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come because I must. I have no choice. The Game is timeless and ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of it was covered with the dark stains, except for the last two lines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave them waiting there below. I hear them laughing as I go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny leaned back and let out her breath. Obviously this poem had impressed her grandfather enough for him to keep it for forty years. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew her grandfather had fought in World War II-he\u0027d been a prisoner in a German POW camp. Maybe he\u0027d met this Johannes Eckhart then. And maybe this Johannes Eckhart had started him thinking. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had all the pieces of the puzzle now. She just didn\u0027t want to put them together. All she could think about was taking the next step in the drama she was playing out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final step, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghostly child in the thongs had vanished; the internal movie had stopped running. But Jenny didn\u0027t try to get it back. She could feel the irresistible tug of real memory at last, and she knew what she had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back to look at the third bookcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a massive one built of solid mahogany, and it usually stood against the same wall as the desk. Today it had been moved. Pulled out at an angle. The dust pattern on the wall behind it showed clearly where it normally rested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been moved to expose a door behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny hadn\u0027t noticed the door before because the case stuck out enough to block it. You had to actually walk beyond the bookcase to get a good look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what Jenny felt compelled to do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfectly ordinary-looking door. Probably leading to a closet. The only strange thing about it was the huge backward-leaning X deeply carved into the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarved and colored a rusty brown like the stains on the poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe internal movie had started up again, even\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethough Jenny didn\u0027t need or want it. The ghostly little girl was standing in surprise in front of the door, swaying from one foot to the other. Obviously temptation was fighting with obedience-and winning. The wind-ruffled hair was shaken back, the tanned legs flashed, two small hands grasped the doorknob-and the ghost disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I opened it, Jenny thought. But no image of opening it, or of what had happened after, would come to her mind. She was going to have to find that out for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the way to the door her heart was thudding wild disapproval. Her body seemed to have more sense than she did. No-don\u0027t-no-don\u0027t, no-don\u0027t-no-don\u0027t, her racing pulse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny took hold of the knob. The thudding became a screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, don\u0027t. Don\u0027t-don\u0027t-don\u0027t____\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flung open the door. Ice and shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all she could see. The closet was wide and very deep, and the inside of it was a whirling, seething mixture of white and black. Frost coated the walls, icicles hung like teeth from the ceiling. A blast of freezing wind went straight through Jenny, chilling her as if she\u0027d been plunged into Arctic waters. The tips of her fingers went numb, the skin shriveling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so cold it stopped her breath. It stopped her from moving. The ice was so bright it blinded her. She got just one glimpse of what was at the center of that whirlpool of light and dark. Eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark eyes, watching eyes, sardonic, cruel, amused eyes. Ancient eyes. Jenny recognized them. They were the eyes she sometimes saw just at the moment of falling asleep or of waking up. The eyes she saw at night in her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes in the shadows. Evil, malicious, knowing eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne pair was an indescribably beautiful blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have the air to scream; her lungs were rebelling against the freezing wind she was trying to draw into them. But she had to scream-she had to do something-because they were coming out. The eyes were coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if they were coming from very far away, rushing toward her, riding the storm. She had to move-she had to run. The glittery black eyes of the alien Visitors, the slanted eyes of the dark elves-Jenny had thought those were frightening, but they were nothing compared to this. They were feeble, petty imitations. No horror that human beings had invented to scare themselves came anywhere close. Vampires, aliens, werewolves, ghouls, they were all nothing. Stories made up to hide the real fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terror that came in the darkness, the one that everyone knew about, and everyone forgot. Only sometimes, waking up between dreams, did the full realization hit. And even then it was seldom remembered, and if it was remembered it was dismissed the next morning. The knowledge couldn\u0027t survive in daylight. But at night sometimes people glimpsed the truth. That humans weren\u0027t alone. They shared the world with them. The Others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Watchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadow Men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ones who walked freely through the human world, and who had another world of their own. They\u0027d been called different things in different ages, but their true nature always came through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey granted favors-sometimes. They always asked for something in return, usually more than you could afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey liked games, riddles, any kind of play. But they were unreliable-whimsical. They balanced any good they did with capricious evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey preyed on humans. When people lost time, they were responsible. When people disappeared, they were laughing. People who got into their world usually didn\u0027t get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had power. Trying to get a good look at them-or trap them-was always a bad idea. Even being too curious about them could kill you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more thing. They were heartbreakingly beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this passed through Jenny\u0027s mind in a matter of seconds. She didn\u0027t need to reason it out. She knew. It was as if a crust had fallen away from her mind, and she saw the truth as a complete, coherent whole. All she could think was, So that\u0027s it. I remember now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes were still rushing toward her. Her loose hair whipped around her face in the wind, her own breath coating it with ice. She couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name called in a terrible voice. Before she could turn, she was caught around the waist and lifted-lifted as if she were five years old and weighed thirty-seven pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandpa,\" she gasped and threw her arms around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smaller than she remembered, too-and just now his tired, kind face was etched in absolute horror. Jenny tried to cling to him, but he slung her around, thrusting her behind the bookcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nauthiz! Nauthiz!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trying to shut the door, tracing over the rune on the front with stabs of his finger. His slashing motions as he traced the X became more and more violent, and his voice was the most dreadful thing Jenny had ever heard. \"Nauthiz!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door wouldn\u0027t shut. The old man\u0027s shouts were becoming screams of despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white light was coming from the closet. A white storm, with tendrils and lashings of mist. Dark strands were interwoven with the white. The tendrils were writhing around Jenny\u0027s grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny tried to scream. She couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blasted out, blowing her grandfather\u0027s sparse hair. All his clothes were rippling. Frost flowed out on the ceiling, down to the desk, to the ground-level windows. It spread like crystals growing along the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears froze in Jenny\u0027s eyes. She seemed to be locked in the form of a stricken five-year-old. She couldn\u0027t make herself go to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices that spoke from the mist were as cold as the wind. Like bells made of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t be put back____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the laws... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a claim, now... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her grandfather\u0027s voice, full of desperate fear. \"Anything else. You can have anything else-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She broke the rune____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... set us free...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... and we want her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her to us.\" This was all the voices together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t!\" her grandfather said. It was almost a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll take her____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll embrace her____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, let\u0027s keep her,\" said a voice full of subtle, elemental music. Like water running over rock. \"I want her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all want her____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... We\u0027re all hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Jenny\u0027s grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice like an ice floe cracking said, \"There\u0027s only one way to change the consequences. Make a new bargain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s grandfather\u0027s jaw worked, and he backed away from the closet a few steps. \"You mean ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A life for a life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone must take her place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now, that\u0027s only fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices were delicate, reasonable. Evil. Only the water-voice seemed to have an objection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want her... .\" it argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, youth,\" said a voice as slow as a glacier, and all of them laughed like Christmas bells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready,\" said Jenny\u0027s grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jenny screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could move at last-but it was too late. She remembered everything now. She had been cowering behind the bookcase, her five-year-old mind probably better able to deal with the reality of the Shadow Men than an adult\u0027s. They were the monsters that scare every five-year-old. The Bogeymen. The Bad Things. And they were taking her grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d jumped up then and run, as she was running now. Toward the closet. Toward the white tendrils of mist that were coiling around her grandfather, toward the ice storm of eyes. She\u0027d heard her grandfather screaming that day as the storm dragged him into the closet. She\u0027d reached for him, catching his flailing hand. She\u0027d been screaming, too, just as she was screaming now, and the freezing wind had been howling around her, full of angry, evil, ravenous voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one instant, then as now, it had been a horrible tug-of-war. She, Jenny, clinging on to her grandfather\u0027s hand with all her strength. They, in the ice storm, pulling him away. Into the depths of a closet that had become endless, a tunnel reaching to some other world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could never hope to stop them, of course. She succeeded only in being dragged along the floor, her clothes torn, her shoes lost, her bare feet raking up ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both going in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her grandfather slapped her hands away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitting and scratching, he tore out of her grip. Jenny fell on the floor, the ice cold under her bare legs. She was directly in front of the closet, and she had a perfect view of the screaming, whirling pin-wheel that had been a man, disappearing into a white cloud which got smaller and smaller as if speeding away and finally disappeared itself, becoming a closet wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the shrieking wind stopped and the room was empty and Jenny was sobbing alone in the silence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-13.html","bookId":2100,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM"}
