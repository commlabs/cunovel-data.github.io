Gods below – in all my days left I’ll never forget—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped when he saw the black rage in her face. ‘We wanted them broken , sapper – not all dead!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStern scowled. ‘Sorry, Fist, but nobody told us that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he thought she might attack him. Instead, off she stormed. Stern watched her head laterally across the slope to where regulars and heavies were drawing up, struggling to stay on what was left of the cobbled road. Shit, we’re going to have to rebuild that, aren’t we? But isn’t that the secret truth of everything in the military? Order us to blow it up, and then order us to rebuild the fucker. Ah, the sapper’s lot …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManx crunched down at his side, his face flash-burned and smeared with greasy smoke. ‘Why’re we holding up? Got plenty left!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fist’s orders, Manx. Listen, pass word along – repack the crates, use all that extra padding.’ He straightened, arched out the ache in his lower back, and then looked round. Enormous holes in the earth, huge craters steaming, heaps of shattered bodies, dust and dirt and blood still raining down through the choking smoke. He sighed. ‘Looks like our work here is done.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaylock helped Erekala to his feet. There was a storm in his head, a droning rush as if the heavens had opened to a deluge, and beneath that pounded the labouring drum of his own heart. Looking up, squinting through the pall of smoke and dust, he saw his soldiers swarming like wasps – officers were shouting, straining to assert some order in the chaos. ‘What – what is happening?’ He heard his own question as the faintest of whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaylock replied from what seemed a thousand paces away. ‘There are Malazans on the other side of the pass, Commander – at least four companies.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But that’s impossible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They simply appeared, sir. Now we are trapped between two armies!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErekala shook his head, struggling to clear his thoughts. This cannot be. We were told there was no other way through the mountains . ‘Form up into hollow squares, the wounded in the centre.’ Staggering, he set out towards the southern stretch of the pass. Behind him, Staylock was shouting orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing through his soldiers – appalled at their shattered discipline – Erekala moved through the camp, still half dazed, until he was beyond the last of the Perish tents. The smoke and dust flowed past him, carrying with it the stench of burnt meat and scorched cloth and leather. He thought back to what he had seen down among the trenches and shivered. What has come to us? What have we become, to do such things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin sight of the Malazans, he halted. There was no mistaking this – the companies he now looked upon were the same as those he had seen earlier, down on the north side of the pass. Warren. But … no one has such power – I doubt even the gods could open such gates. Yet, how can I deny what I see with my own eyes? The enemy was drawn up, presenting a curious mix of heavy infantry, marines with crossbows, regulars and skirmishers. Beyond them a single small tent had been raised, around which soldiers clustered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA messenger ran up to Erekala from behind. ‘Sir! The enemy has reached the highest trench and continues to advance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thank you,’ Erekala replied. He saw two figures emerging from the ranks, walking side by side, one tall, the other almost as tall but much broader across the shoulders. The ebon sheen of their skin cut a stark contrast to the bleached landscape. Dal Honese or southeast Seven Cities – ah, I know these two men. The thin one – I remember him standing at the prow, facing down the Tiste Edur fleet. The High Mage, Quick Ben. Meaning the other one is the assassin. They do not belong here. But, among all the flaws afflicting me, blindness is not one of them . Ignoring the soldier behind him, the commander set out to meet the two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Look at us now,’ Quick Ben muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never mind us,’ Kalam growled in reply. ‘I see the commander – that’s Erekala, right? See the ranks behind him? They’re a mess.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You know,’ the wizard said, ‘I didn’t think it was possible. Opening two gates at the same time like that, and the size of them! Gods below, he really is the Master of the Deck.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalam glanced across at him. ‘You were sceptical?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m always sceptical.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, impressive as it was, Paran came out half dead – so even he has his limits.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Minala’s all over him – jealous, Kalam?’\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-357.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
