This is bringing purpose back into my life, something I’d been missing. Ashtyn knew I had fight left in me . . . and she helped me realize that I have goals and dreams just like she does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandmother is more than happy to help set my plans in motion. It takes a bunch of calls to some universities and coaches I once played with, and pulling some strings that only an heir of Worthington Industries can pull off. I fly back to Chicago when I know Ashtyn’s got her interview at Northwestern University. I know she won’t be at practice. As soon as I land, I head over to Fremont High.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk on the field, and the familiar scent of fresh-cut grass envelops me. The coach is in an intense conversation with one of the assistant coaches. “Coach Dieter,” I say, jogging to catch up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coach turns around, his sharp blue eyes giving me a onceover. “Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow. Suddenly I’m nervous. How could my nerves be wound tight just by talking to a small-town coach? Probably because in the back of my mind, I know this is it and I can’t turn back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a transfer student,” I tell Dieter. “I’m startin’ here in the fall and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Son, I haven’t got all day. State your business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell him, straight up, “I want to play ball. Quarterback.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, I know you lost McKnight and your backup isn’t exactly starter material.” I can’t afford to show any weakness, only determination and confidence. “I’ll be better than McKnight on his best day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach Dieter’s eyebrows rise. “You sure are a cocky sonofa-bitch. What’s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out my hand. “Derek. Derek Fitzpatrick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coach takes my hand and shakes it. It’s a manly shake, one of those hard ones that tests the strength of another guy and it’s over before you know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’d you play?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Started in Alabama, then played at Sierra High in California. State champion, all-state player—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What year are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be a senior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter calls over one of the assistant coaches. “Derek Fitzpatrick, this is our DC, Coach Heilmann. Coach Heilmann, Derek here thinks he’s a better QB than Landon McKnight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defensive coordinator gives a short laugh, then shrugs. “What the hell. I’d give him a tryout, Bill. At this point it can’t hurt,” the assistant coach says before leaving us alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter taps his pen on his clipboard. “What can hurt is egomaniac wannabes wasting my time.” Before I can tell him about my stats, he says, “Follow me, son. Let’s get you suited up and see what you got.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow the coach into the locker room, where the rest of the team is putting on their gear. He motions for me to wait outside the equipment cage while he grabs me pads and a helmet. After he hands them to me, I sit on a bench and check out my future teammates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch sight of Victor immediately. He takes one look at me and storms up, facing me head-on with fierce hatred on his face. “Get the fuck out of here, Fitzpatrick. You think you can hurt Ashtyn, then suddenly have a change of heart and expect her to run back in your arms so you can take advantage of her again? That’s bullshit, man. I don’t trust you, and neither does anyone else on this team, so you might as well go back to where you came from.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not goin’ anywhere,” I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah? You want to get to Ashtyn, you’ve got to get through every single one of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem.” Whatever it takes. I’m not backing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes me. I push back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re about to get into it when Dieter blows his whistle. Everybody stops what they’re doing and suddenly the entire locker room is quiet. All eyes are on me. Obviously if Victor considers me the enemy, they all consider me the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone on the field!” Dieter yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, this is not going to be easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJet pushes my helmet off the bench. “Don’t expect any one of us to kiss your ass or fawn all over you because you’re supposed to be some sort of master QB and all. We all watched Ashtyn cry for days after you left. It was fucked-up, ’cause she never gets that emotional. You got a death wish, this is the right place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I run on the field after suiting up, Victor walks right up to Dieter. “We want Butter in as QB, Coach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter doesn’t even look up from his clipboard. “I’m not planning anything but a winning season. From my experience, there’s nothin’ like shaking things up to make a team stronger. Maybe a new QB will light a fire under your asses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor is getting riled up now, because he’s breathing hard and his fist is clenched on to the face mask of his helmet hanging at his side. “Coach—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Salazar, stop whining. Now get your ass over to calisthenics. You, too, Fitzpatrick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor stalks over to the field where the rest of the team is doing jumping jacks. Dieter grabs my elbow as I walk past him. “He’s not gonna make it easy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not used to things coming easy,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI better keep my mind on the game and not the girl who has invaded my thoughts and my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring practice, I’m ordered to shadow the current QB, Brandon Butter. After he runs a play, Dieter sidelines him and tells me to call the same play. My handoff to Trey Matthews is textbook, but he drops the ball as soon as his hands touch the leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” I ask Trey after he drops the ball a second time. “That was a textbook handoff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts walking away. “For a prodigy, your skills are obviously lacking,” he mumbles, then crudely grabs his crotch for my benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you. My skills are spot-on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJet isn’t any help, either. He tries his hardest to catch the current QB’s throws every time, even when they’re way off target, but he practically runs in the opposite direction the second the ball leaves my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys on the offensive line leave a hole wide open for Victor to sack me. He does, repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, you suck!” Victor says to me when we’re getting in formation. He chuckles, amused at my inability to show off my skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t suck if your teammates would do their job,” I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the ball is hiked to me, I look for Jet but am immediately sacked by Victor again. None of my offensive linemen are protecting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was for Ashtyn,” Victor says, shoving me to the ground as I try to get up. Then he puts a hand out to help me, but I don’t take it. It’s his damn fault I got sacked. With my frustration at an all-time high, I stand up and push him. He’s a linebacker. I shouldn’t be surprised that his feet stay solid on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want a piece of me?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJet appears between us. He grabs the front of my jersey and urges me away from Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s too late. “Give me what you got, Salazar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brace myself and keep my center of gravity as he attempts to shove me to the ground. Ha. The big guy thought he’d take me down without an effort, but I’m one stubborn motherfucker, my adrenaline is running high, and I refuse to be taken down. Frustrated, he removes his helmet and gets in my face. Dieter blows his whistle. I think he’s been blowing it ever since I got sacked, but I’m ignoring it just like everyone else at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t expect to come here, snap your fingers, and make us work for you,” Salazar says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whip off my helmet. “I’ve played with freshmen who could run circles around you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushes me just as Coach Dieter blows his whistle again. It’s not easy to fight with equipment on. We’re rolling on the ground trying to get at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Break it up!” I hear Dieter yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bunch of guys force us off each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fitzpatrick, on the bench!” Dieter orders, motioning to the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? I’m being singled out? Fuck that. “You’ve got to be kiddin’. Coach, it wasn’t my—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter points to the bench, cutting me off. “I’m not gonna say it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis team . . . these assholes . . . are fucking up my chance. I sit on the bench, seething from every pore of my body as the players put in 110 percent for Butter even though he sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fitzpatrick, get your butt over here!” Coach Dieter yells from across the field. “The rest of you, take a lap around the field, then you’re dismissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my helmet and walk over to the coach. “I didn’t come here to be sidelined.” I can’t hide my frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, Derek, despite what happened on the field I can tell you’ve got a good arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the team’ll back me up—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They won’t.” He takes his hat off and leans forward. “I can tell them until my face is blue, but for some reason the guys don’t trust you. My boys’ll take a hit to protect Butter even if it means breakin’ their bones to do it. You need to earn their respect and loyalty. Once you do that, we’ve got a real good shot this year. It’s up to you. You up for the challenge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Coach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Now go do damage control and fix whatever drama is happening off the field, then meet me back here for practice Monday morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the parking lot, Salazar is about to get on his motorcycle. He stiffens when he sees me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m tryin’ to get Ashtyn back,” I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck with that,” he says with a shake of his head. “Not gonna happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, Salazar . . .” Time to let it all out, because there might not be a second chance at this. “I love her.” I open my arms out wide. “Why do you think I’m doin’ all this? It’s for her, it’s for us, it’s for me. Shit, I don’t know. Maybe you’re right and I’m the biggest asshole who ever walked the earth. But you know more than anyone how she feels about me. If I have a remote chance of winnin’ her back . . . I’ve got to do this. Hell, I don’t blame you for wantin’ to beat the shit out of me. She wants a winning team, Salazar. I want to help give that to her. Help me give that to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers his head and sighs. “You hurt her, Fitzpatrick. She cried in my arms like a fuckin’ baby, man. She’s like a sister to me and I will not let you hurt her again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t intend to. I hate to ask you this, but I need your help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to borrow tapes of every game Fremont’s played for the past three years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every game?” Victor narrows his eyes like he did that first day we met. He looked at me like I was the enemy on a rival team. “Should I trust you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look him straight in the eye and say, “No. But I’d really appreciate it if you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 54\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshtyn \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wild-cards-wild-cards-1/page-39.html","bookId":2770,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:15:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:15:19 PM"}
