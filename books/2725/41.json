Josh joined him, and Steven opened up the sunroof and stuck his head out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sidelong glance at Jere, I said, “These are your friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and started rapping too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bar was packed. Girls everywhere in high heels and glossy lipstick, with their hair shiny and straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight away, Redbird started trying to dance on every girl that walked by. Shot down each and every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the bar to get the first round, and Steven followed me. We were waiting to get the bartender’s attention when he clapped his hand on my shoulder and said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how are you doing with this whole thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? The wedding?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from him. “It is what it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think it’s a mistake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have to answer him, because I finally got the bartender’s attention. “Five double shots of tequila and a Newcastle,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven said, “You’re not going to take a shot with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to take care of you numskulls, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe carried the shots back to the table where the other guys were sitting. All five guys pounded them back, and then Redbird got up and started beating his chest and yelling like Tarzan. The guys busted up laughing and started egging him on to go talk to a couple of girls on the dance floor. He and Steven went over to them, and we all sat back and watched. Steven was having better luck than Redbird. He and the red-haired girl started dancing, and Redbird came back to our table, dejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll get us another round,” I said. I figured it was my duty as best man to get them all wasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came back with five more shots of tequila, and since Steven was still out on the dance floor, Jere downed his shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was nursing my beer when I heard that guy Josh say to Jeremiah, “Dude, you’re finally gonna get to close with Belly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snapped up. Jeremiah had his arm slung around Josh while he sang, “It’s a nice day for a white wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn’t had sex yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard Josh say, “Yo, you’re, like, a virgin now too. You haven’t gotten any since Lacie in Cabo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCabo? Jeremiah had gone to Cabo this past spring break. When he and Belly were a couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah started to sing, off-key, “Like a virgin, touched for the very first time.” Then he stood up. “I gotta piss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him stumble off to the bathroom, and Josh said, “Fisher’s a lucky bastard. Lacie is smokin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom elbowed him and said, loudly, “Shit, remember how they locked us out of the hotel room?” To me, he said, “This is hilarious, man. Hilarious. They locked us out, and they were so into it, they didn’t even hear us knocking. We had to sleep in the friggin’ hallway that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, Josh said, “That girl was hella loud, too. Oh, Jere-uhhh-mi-uhhh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw red. Under the tables, I clenched my fists. I wanted to hit something. First I wanted to hit these two guys, and then I wanted to go find my brother and beat the shit out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped up from the table and made my way across the club, shouldering and pushing my way through the crowd until I got to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI banged on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Somebody’s in here,” Jeremiah slurred from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard him retch into the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there another few seconds, and then I walked away, past our table and outside to the parking lot.n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, the boys came back, drunk as skunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d seen Jere drunk before, but not like this. He was so wasted, the boys practically had to carry him upstairs. He could barely open his eyes. “Belllllly,” he called out. “I’m gonna marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the bottom of the staircase, I yelled back, “Go to sleep!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad wasn’t with them. I asked Tom, “Where’s Conrad? I thought he was your designated driver.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was swaying upstairs. “I dunno. He was with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went out to the car, thinking maybe he’d passed out in the backseat. But he wasn’t there. I was starting to get worried, but just then I caught a glimpse of him way down the beach, sitting in the lifeguard stand. I took off my shoes and made my way over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come down,” I called up. “Don’t fall asleep up there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come up,” he said. “Just for a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for a second. He didn’t sound drunk; he sounded fine. I climbed up the side of the chair and sat next to him. “Did you guys have fun?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the water lap along the shore. There was a crescent moon. I said, “I love it here at night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, suddenly, he said, “I have to tell you something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in his voice scared me. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking out at the ocean, he said, “Jere cheated on you when he was in Cabo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t what I expected him to say. It was maybe the last thing I expected him to say. His jaw was clenched, and he looked angry. “Tonight at the club, one of his dumbass friends said something.” He finally looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry you had to hear it from me. I thought you had a right to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know how to answer him. I finally said, “I already knew about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head jerked back. “You knew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re still marrying him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks felt hot. “He made a mistake,” I said softly. “He hates himself for what he did. I forgave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything’s fine now. Everything’s really great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad’s mouth curled in disgust. “Are you kidding me? He spent the night in a hotel room with some girl and you’re defending him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you to judge us? It’s none of your business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None of my business? That shithead is my brother, and you’re …” He didn’t finish his sentence. Instead he said, “I never thought you’d be the kind of girl who would put up with that from a guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I put up with a lot worse from you.” I said it automatically. I said it without thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes flashing, he said, “I never once cheated on you. I never even looked at another girl when we were together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid away from him and started to climb down. “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” I didn’t know why he was bringing any of this up now. I just wanted it all to go away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-41.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
