All of the Cultivators in the area had blank looks on their faces. Their minds suddenly seemed to be filled with a whirlwind; their memories were thrown into chaos. It was as if they heard what the black-robed man said, but couldn’t remember it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of contradiction filled them, as if fantasy and reality were being mixed. All the surrounding Cultivators’ faces paled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered as he sensed the fearsomeness of his opponent. He knew that this was a power that he could not fight against. He fell back. The power of his opponent’s words did not affect him too much, but his mind still shook. The reason for this was that the man’s voice was bolstered with Demonic Qi, and transformed into complex magical symbols that spread out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The way I’ve been using Demonic Qi is far too simplistic….” thought Meng Hao, panting. “I never thought it could be used that way!” His eyes glowing brightly, he shot backward, even as the black-robed man flew like lightning toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the black-robed man lifted his hand and pointed at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, surrounding Demonic Qi rushed to congeal around the finger. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a spear which screamed through the air toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else could see this happening. What they saw was the black-robed man pointing at Meng Hao. However, Meng Hao could very clearly see everything. A sudden, intense feeling of grave danger swept over him. However, even as that happened, Meng Hao looked at the black-robed man and suddenly thought of Patriarch Reliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, refined from blood by the Third Generation Demon Sealer…. Patriarch Reliance, a Demon sealed by past generations for me, to be my Dao Protector…. I am the Ninth Generation….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Things didn’t work out well with Patriarch Reliance, but he still wouldn’t kill me. All he could do was run away. This Demon Weapon refined by the Third Generation Demon Sealer wants to consume me so that he can live forever. This situation seems different than that of Patriarch Reliance, but actually, it’s fundamentally very similar!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao took a deep breath and then began to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ancient Dao; Tenacious Desire to Seal the Heavens; Benefaction for All in the Mountains; Dao Tribulation Must Come to the Nine Mountains and Seas; My Fate is the Aeon!” He uttered the words of the scripture with a strange, Demonic cadence that gave birth to bizarre ripples. Every word seemed like a unique magical sealing symbol that connected with the Heavens and the starry sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke the words, a look of astonishment and disbelief appeared on the face of the black-robed man. His body trembled and massive amounts of black mist began to fall away from him. A miserable scream emanated from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Sealing Scripture!?” howled the black-robed man. “Impossible! Haven’t you lost your legacy?! How could you know that damned Demon Sealing Scripture!!” He reached toward the vortex in the sky and made a grasping motion. Suddenly, on the altar in the vortex, the faces began to howl and push down onto the mist. For some reason, the black-robed man’s body was no longer in a state of distortion, but rather, stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite that, his aura was weaker than before, by more than half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re dead!!” he said, glaring murderously at Meng Hao, well aware that his time was running out. As of now, he could only temporarily suppress the power of the Demon Sealing Scripture. His right hand suddenly lifted up and he pointed again toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered as his opponent suppressed the power of the scripture. He gave a cold snort. Before, the man was at the peak of his power, and was able to shatter the Outlander Beast with a single blow. At that time, Meng Hao was no match for him. But now, he was weakened. This Demon Weapon Lonelytomb… was now someone Meng Hao could fight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am a Demon Sealer,” thought Meng Hao, “sensitive to Demonic Qi and able to use it. I should be able to exceed this so-called Demon Weapon Lonelytomb. If he can use the Demonic Qi in that way, then so can I!” He took a deep breath and lifted his hand. He thought back to the scene in which the Outlander Beast had been defeated, and that great door that had suddenly opened in his mind. Instantly, the Demonic Qi in the area rushed toward him and began to congeal. A rumbling sound could be heard as it suddenly slammed into the Demonic Qi spear that was closing in on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the explosion rang out, Meng Hao was sent tumbling backward, blood spraying from his mouth. After he came to a stop, he coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. His face was pale, but he was laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his ability to control Demonic Qi was not as refined as that of his opponent, he had now achieved a new understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring it on!” he said, his eyes shining brightly. As he floated there in mid-air, he lifted his right hand, causing more Demonic Qi to rush toward him. It surrounded him, transforming into a gigantic vortex of Demonic Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed man’s eyes flickered, and inwardly he was shocked. He never imagined that his opponent would be able to learn something new and then make so much progress in such a short period of time. The difference in rudimentary knowledge of Demonic Qi and the ability to use it as it had been just now, was not that of a single step, but more like the huge gap between Heaven and Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With powers of insight like that, you deserve to be called a Demon Sealer. But if you want to learn how to control Demonic Qi from me…. Too bad! I won’t give you the chance! I don’t have to use Demonic Qi to kill you. I can slay you with only three forms of my divine ability!” The black-robed man made a grasping motion, and a long, black spear magically appeared in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First Form, Butcher the Shocked Immortal!” As the man spoke the words, he suddenly waved the spear. It instantly transformed into a black dragon which roared, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws as it twisted majestically in the air. It emanated Demonic Qi as it shot toward Meng Hao. Even as it flew through the air, it flickered, multiplying into nine separate dragons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine deadly dragons shook Heaven and Earth as they shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky dimmed and the cloud seethed as nine black dragons screamed through the air. Visible in their claws were corpses, all of whom emitted mournful wails and screams of agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of it pierced Meng Hao’s mind, causing him to think of the slaughter of a battlefield. His eyes glowed brightly as a feeling of unease swept over him. He waved his right hand, and instantly Wooden Time Swords flew out to form the Lotus Sword Formation. A droning sound could be heard as it rotated, sending out the explosive power of Time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao had been using this Time Sword Formation for a long time, and was very familiar with it. The instant it appeared, the air was distorted and twisted. Time changed. As the nine dragons closed in, Meng Hao performed an incantation with both hands and then pointed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lotus Time Formation blossomed into the image of a lotus which shot toward the nine dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge boom could be heard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time Termination!” he cried, biting his tongue and spitting out some blood. He waved his hand, causing the blood to transform into a blood mist which shot toward the Lotus Time Formation. This heart blood caused the Time power of the sword formation to instantly explode out. At the same time, Meng Hao slipped on the blood-coloured mask, causing a red glow to flicker into being. Next, four wooden swords flew out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were the swords that Ji Nineteen had referred to as Immortal Murdering Swords!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four wooden swords shot forward, merging into the Lotus Sword Formation; instantly a powerful killing intent radiated out…. These dragons must die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rumbling sound filled the entire sky and Meng Hao’s body trembled as he retreated backward. The Lotus Sword Formation fell about and the four wooden words were sent spinning. However, the nine dragons also exploded, shattering into countless pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Second Form, Reincarnation Extermination!” A mysterious glow appeared in the eyes of the black-robed man. His body shot back as he waved his right hand. The black spear instantly transformed into a black beam of light which shot at incredible speed toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it neared, it seemed as if it were shattering the various layers of air that it was shooting through. The deadly spear neared, seemingly capable of shattering everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that were all there were to it, it wouldn’t be a very big deal. However, as the spear got closer, shattering through the successive layers of air, images began to appear. Each of these images seemed to be from a different time. However, in all of the images, Meng Hao could be seen! Different versions of Meng Hao from different times periods, as if these were various reincarnations of him throughout the ages!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis past life, the life before that, all past lives! It was impossible to tell if the images were real or fake, but they certainly looked incredibly realistic!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s mind trembled as he looked at what appeared to be thousands of past lives. At the same time, he had the feeling that he wasn’t looking at anything. A profound sense of deadly crisis rose up in him, as if any ability to dodge or flee had been sealed off. It was as if this spear was going to destroy all of his thousands of past lives!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the black spear approach, and an enormous pressure weighed down on him, weakening his Cultivation base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, his forehead began to glow. All of the great totem tattoos on his body erupted out. Metal, Wood, Fire, Earth. A sea of flames appeared, along with an enormous tree, a rain of gold, and archaic Frost soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Reincarnation Extermination spear attack neared, Meng Hao opened his mouth; an azure blur shot out which transformed into an Immortal’s Sword which smashed through the air, emanating shocking Sword Qi. This was not the Dancing Sword Qi, but rather the sword will which was embodied within the sword itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Instead of you severing my reincarnation,” said Meng Hao, “how about I do it myself!” He waved his hand, and a glow of determination appeared in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword will merged with the power of his four great totems, and then began to emit a shocking azure light. The sword shot forward in the blink of an eye, faster than the black spear, to slice through the reincarnations!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA massive boom lifted up from the Reincarnation Extermination, shaking everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe azure Immortal’s Sword was sent flying backward. It transformed into an azure glow that returned into Meng Hao’s mouth. His body trembled and he fell backward, coughing up a huge mouthful of blood. When he looked back up, his gaze was cold as he stared at the black-robed man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed man’s heart and mind shook as he glared back at Meng Hao. He also retreated backward, the long, black spear in his hand crumbling into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, first he used that scripture to weaken me. Then, my Demonic Qi attacks, which have fearsome exterminating power on just about anyone, are virtually useless against him because he’s a Demon Sealer. If it weren’t for that, this fight wouldn’t be so troublesome!” The man suddenly reached up to push his hand down on his forehead. His body became blurry, almost illusory. At the same time, another black spear magically appeared in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spear was just as black as before, and seemed to be connected to the mist that formed his body, as if they were the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Third form….” Before the black-robed man could finish speaking, the killing intent in Meng Hao’s eyes suddenly flared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What third form, bitch!?” Meng Hao had already come to notice that in both speech and action, he had been influenced quite profoundly by the parrot…. For example, the words he had just spoken had actually come out quite naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he spoke them, he moved forward, pushing down onto the blood-colored mask. Then he extended his arm, and everything began to turn black. It was as if a massive flag were covering over the sky and the land!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Meng Hao’s most powerful magical item, the flag of three streamers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-494\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-496\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-495","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM"}
