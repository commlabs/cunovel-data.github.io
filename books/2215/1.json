I don\u0027t really know all the secrets of the Order. I do know however that I served it most of my mortal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the Talamasca Motherhouse in England that the Vampire Lestat first made himself known to me. He came into my study one winter night and caught me quite unawares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learnt very quickly that it was one thing to read and write about the supernatural and quite another to see it with your own eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in another physical body now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that physical body has been transformed by Lestat\u0027s powerful vampiric blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m among the most dangerous of the vampires, and one of the most trusted. Even the wary vampire Armand revealed to me the story of his life. Perhaps you\u0027ve read the biography of Armand which I released into the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that story ended, Lestat had wakened from a long sleep in New Orleans to listen to some very beautiful and seductive music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was music that lulled him back again into unbroken silence as he retreated once more to a convent building to lie upon a dusty marble floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many vampires then in the city of New Orleans¡ªvagabonds, rogues, foolish young ones who had come to catch a glimpse of Lestat in his seeming helplessness. They menaced the mortal population. They annoyed the elders among us who wanted invisibility and the right to hunt in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll those invaders are gone now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome were destroyed, others merely frightened. And the elders who had come to offer some solace to the sleeping Lestat have gone their separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs this story begins, only three of us remain in New Orleans. And we three are the sleeping Lestat, and his two faithful fledglings¡ªLouis de Pointe du Lac, and I, David Talbot, the author of this tale. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-1.html","bookId":2215,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM"}
