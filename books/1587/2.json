The winner will get to keep Uley, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you looked outside, Major? I mean real y looked? Keeping Uley isn\u0027t a victory; it\u0027s a punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney leaned on the table. \"I\u0027ve been doing this a long time, Captain. You are not the first to crack - you won\u0027t be the last. Not everyone has the resolve to keep up the fight. But you can be sure that when your time comes, you won\u0027t simply be decommissioned. If I were you, I\u0027d keep it together as long as possible, because I am always watching and when you stumble, I will be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had gone too far to care about a threat. \"I was taken from my mother when I was fourteen years old,\" she told him. \"She was sick when I left. I wasn\u0027t all owed to look after her. The Building Association had to take care of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what the Building Associations are for,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney said. \"They\u0027re there to shoulder the responsibility for the residents of the building, so people like us can fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone must do their part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother died when I was twenty-two. In those eight years I was permitted to see her three times. There is a child sitting at the psycher table now, Major. She was taken away from the family when she was twelve. It\u0027s getting worse. When will it end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Melko surrenders.\" He slid a datacard across the table. \"Your mission for today, Captain. Penetrate the secure block of the Melko bionet, burn the data, and get out with your minds intact. Brodwyn expended too many resources on your training to lose you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire Shannon dashed through the woods. Tal trees thrust to the distant skies on both sides of her. Their dark limbs scratched at each other, their jagged branches thrusting out like talons ready for the kil . Behind her, the team sprinted, single-file. Lean, furry, they surged through the woods on all fours, their clawed paws digging into the forest floor as they ran. She saw them as beasts with glowing eyes. No doubt they saw themselves as something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany years ago the need for faster data processing forced larger corporations and governments to implement biological computer systems that seamlessly integrated with the inorganic computers. It was discovered that only psychers could connect directly to the bionet and that the connection overwhelmed their minds. The human brain couldn\u0027t cope with the tremendous influx of information, and it deluded itself by turning code and synthetic neurosignals into a dream, interpreting the streaming data as a familiar environment, knitted from the individual psycher\u0027s memories and imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery psycher perceived the bionet differently. For Nicholas it was hel with molten lava and fire-belching dragons; for Liz it was a mountain pass strewn with snow, where avalanches and snow creatures waited on every turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire saw a forest. Code became trees, secure data turned into fortified castles, and enemy psychers turned into monsters. If it looked scary, it was a threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hint of movement made her spin in mid-step. A large red-eyed bird with wicked dinosaur jaws instead of a beak raised its wings, preparing to dive at her from a tree branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire leaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bird swooped down, talons out, teeth-studded jaws opened wide. Claire turned her head, throwing her body right. The jaws missed her by a fraction of an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer silvery fangs closed on the bird\u0027s long neck, piercing flesh. The pressure of her jaws crushed the vertebrae, the synthetic neurosignals conjuring the taste of blood in her mouth. They dropped to the ground, the bird flailing under her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the team dashed past them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire planted a clawed paw on the bird\u0027s head and ripped, tearing the neck in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bird stopped moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThreat neutralized. An enemy psycher was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire sprinted after the line of beasts, caught up, and sped by them, resuming her place at the head of the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe always took the point. She was the strongest psycher and it was her duty as an officer to protect the rest of her team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bird\u0027s dimming eyes lingered in her memory. She had terminated a human mind. She would have to kil others before the mission ended. She would do it today to keep Liz and the rest alive, but eventual y the Intel igence would send her on a solo mission, and she wasn\u0027t sure what the outcome of it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire scanned her environment. The woods before them were clear. Deserted. Anxiety pul ed at her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere were the enemy psychers? She had just kil ed one -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eusual y that meant a concentrated assault. The branches should be teeming with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted to glance back. Only one beast fol owed her - Nicholas, his coat a pale grey. He took another step and exploded into a hundred tiny dark ribbons, melting into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shock punched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire shot out of the bionet and out of her chair, her vision stil a blur. A blink and she saw the room: gun-grey wal s, a long console, five chairs by it, one empty - hers, and four others supporting prone bodies, her teammates, her soldiers, each with a gaping hole in the back of the head. In the split second she saw it all : the jagged edges of the head wounds, the red blood dripping on the floor from Liz\u0027s blond hair, and Major Courtney Rome, a smoking gun in his fingers, his pale grey Intel igence uniform splattered with crimson spray and brain matter. Courtney\u0027s face was slack. His mouth drooped down. His eyes stared at her, hol ow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grasped his mind in a steel fist, ripping through the feeble protection of the psych blocker like it was tissue paper. He cried out and dropped the gun. She forced his brain to haul him upright, every muscle painful y rigid, his body barely balanced on his toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were dead. This morning all of them had eaten a spare breakfast in the commissary. They shared coffee. Liz hid her new nails. Now they were dead. She had protected them for so long and he\u0027d put a gun to their heads and murdered them one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The war is over,\" Courtney whispered. \"We lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost,\" he repeated, his voice a hoarse squeak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Headquarters sent out an emergency bul etin five minutes ago. Melko is occupying our continent. The surrender security protocol was initiated. I have to terminate you. You know too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seared his mind. Death was instant. He didn\u0027t have the time to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his lifeless body dropped to floor, Claire turned and pushed the dimmer switch on the console. The room turned dark. Her fingers flew over the keypad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opaque window in the wal before her faded, revealing the interior of the Intel igence compound below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople dashed back and forth across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed a key, letting the audio feed filter into the room. Gunfire punched the silence. Massive shredders whined, crunching electronics and slicing pseudopaper into atomic dust. Chaos reigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe war was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart hammered in her chest. Her pulse pounded through her head, too loud in her ears. Claire stared at the four corpses in their chairs. She wanted to hug Liz and cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t give in to panic and shock. She had to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a Type A Psycher. An imminent threat. If Melko Corporation found her, she would be kil ed immediately. When you lost a war, you didn\u0027t get to keep your guns. She was infinitely more dangerous than a loaded gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire shut off the audio feed and dimmed the windows. She checked the door. Courtney had engaged the electronic lock. Not enough. A heavy life support unit sat in the corner, for the times when psychers suffered an attack but held on to life. She put her shoulder into it, pushed it across the doorway, barring the door from the inside, and walked past four heads dripping blood back to her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to log into the bionet for the last time to erase herself from Brodwyn data systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Step onto the platform,\" a Melko soldier ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire obeyed, stepping onto the raised circle in the middle of the room. Six high-caliber gun turrets swiveled on their mounts, locking onto her. To the right and left, two Melko soldiers took aim at her head. Across the room an older woman behind a crescent metal console studied the digital screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree weeks ago she had escaped the Intel igence building and returned to her mother\u0027s apartment. It was vacant, like many others, and during her last foray into the Brodwyn bionet, Claire had assigned it to herself. She had resurrected her mother\u0027s data and took on her identity, keeping only her name and her date of birth intact. Only her neighbors could have betrayed her. This morning she was arrested with the rest of the residents of the building and marched down to this depot. Nobody spoke out against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman peered at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire Shannon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Occupation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secretary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any implants, modification, or kinsmen abilities to declare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire\u0027s mind was hidden behind four layers of solid mental shields, enclosed in a hard outer shel , accreted over the period of the last four weeks as a result of constant mental strain. Her surface thoughts coated this shel , as if it were a mirror. Her defenses would withstand a concentrated probe from an adept. To the outside world, her mind appeared very much alive, but completely inert psychical y. Precisely the way she liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Place your hands on the rail in front of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire locked her fingers on the metal rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePale green light slid over her. Two dozen scanners recorded her temperature, pulse, and chemical emissions, assessed the composition of the sweat and oil on her fingertips, and probed her body for combat implants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold male voice announced with robotic precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Implant scan, class A through E, negative. Biological modification negative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Initiating psycher pressure probe,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath her mental core, fear washed over Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressure Probe, PPP, meant pain to a psychic mind. The stronger the psycher, the worse the agony. She had to bear it. Her pulse couldn\u0027t speed up. She couldn\u0027t wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began as a soft buzz in the back of her skul . The buzz built, ratcheting up to deafening intensity, louder, louder, LOUDER. Pain pierced her mind, as if a dril had carved through the bone, grinding, widening the hole with each rotation, turning her neurons into mess of human meat. The world dissolved in agony. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/silver-shark-kinsmen-2/page-2.html","bookId":1587,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:19:44 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:19:44 AM"}
