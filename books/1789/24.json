She tugged impatiently on his hair, telling him without words that she wanted more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth finally settled on top of hers in a gentle caress and his tongue eased inside to stroke hers. He acted as though he had all the time in the world. He was slow, deliberate, exerting only scant pressure as he nudged the fires of passion inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer soft moan told him how much she liked what he was doing to her. He pulled back, saw the passion in her eyes, knew it was mirrored in his own, and let out a low groan of his own. \"So sweet,\" he whispered against her mouth. \"Open up for me,\" he commanded in a rough whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t give her time to comply with that order but used his thumb to force her chin down. His tongue thrust inside, then retreated before penetrating again. She went all soft and willing on him, and that innocent response made him forget about going slow. He was suddenly so hungry for her he couldn\u0027t control his pace. His mouth became hard, demanding. The love play between their tongues—his bold, hers timid—made both of them shake with desire. She was too overwhelmed by the fire Colin was spreading inside her to be afraid of what was to come. She couldn\u0027t think, only react. She moved against him restlessly, unaware of what she was doing now, or what she was doing to him. Her fingers threaded through his hair, and his control almost snapped when she began to whimper and move so enticingly against his hard arousal. The kiss turned carnal, ravenous. Passion ignited into raw desire as his mouth slanted over hers with primal ownership. His hunger stroked her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss seemed unending and yet over all too soon. When Colin pulled back, her mouth was rosy and wet from his touch. The taste of her was on his mouth now, but it wasn\u0027t enough for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe collapsed against his chest and tucked her face under his chin. Her breathing was choppy against his collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin lifted her into his arms and carried her into his room. He gently placed her in the center of his bed and then stood by the side, staring down at her. His hot gaze warmed her and made her shiver at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt drowsy from his kisses. Her mind cleared when he hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his pants and began to pull them off. She closed her eyes and tried to turn away from him. Colin was quicker than she was, however. He\u0027d stripped out of his pants and joined her in the bed before she\u0027d even made it to the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her by her nightgown. The fabric ripped when he pulled her back to him. She only had enough time to gasp before the gown was completely discarded and Colin was covering her with his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe became as rigid as a board. He gently pried her legs apart with his knee and then completely stretched out on top of her just the way he\u0027d fantasized in his dreams since the moment he met her. His hard arousal pressed against the soft curls at the junction of her thighs, and it felt so damn good to him he let out a low growl of satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality was better than fantasy, however, for he hadn\u0027t been able to imagine how incredibly soft and smooth her skin would feel against him. Her br**sts were much fuller than he\u0027d fantasized, and he hadn\u0027t been able to capture the intensity of his reaction to having her trembling underneath him. It was as close to heaven as he thought he\u0027d ever be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin, shouldn\u0027t we have our talk now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned up on his elbows to look at her. Worry was evident in her eyes; victory was evident in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\" He cupped the sides of her face to hold her still, then kissed her long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made her shiver with desire. She couldn\u0027t resist putting her arms around his waist to draw more of his warmth. Her toes curled against his legs and it suddenly wasn\u0027t enough to simply hold on to him. She needed to touch him, stroke him. Her hands moved up his back, then down the sides of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer touch was as light as a butterfly\u0027s wings against his skin and yet it was the most erotic caress he\u0027d ever received. He turned his attention to her neck. She turned her head ever so slightly to give him better access. His teeth gently tugged on her earlobe, sending jolts of pleasure cascading all the way down to her toes, and, dear God, his tongue was making it impossible to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started moving with silent demand for more. Colin shifted his position and kissed a line down her throat. He moved lower and kissed the valley between her br**sts. She smelled like roses and woman. It was a heady combination. Colin inhaled her sweet scent, then used his tongue to taste her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was taking entirely too many liberties with her body. She thought she would die if he stopped. His hands cupped her br**sts and they immediately began to ache for more. She didn\u0027t understand the frustration building inside her. She felt as though she was made of seams and they were all splitting apart on her. Then Colin\u0027s tongue brushed across her nipple. She almost came off the bed. She cried out in fear and pleasure. The feeling was almost too intense to endure, yet it was exquisitely wonderful, too. Her hands dropped back to her sides and she grabbed fistfuls of the sheets in an attempt to anchor herself against the storm of emotions flooding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name came out with a sob and she began to writhe against him when he took her nipple into his mouth and began to suckle. He was driving her beyond control. His hands stroked her everywhere. She drew a deep, ragged breath and began to whimper. His mouth captured hers again just as his hand slid into the soft curls shielding her virginity. She tried to stop him, but he wouldn\u0027t be denied. His fingers slowly penetrated the tight, slick opening, then withdrew. The pad of his thumb rubbed against the very spot he knew would drive her wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made love to her with his fingers until she was mindless to everything but finding fulfillment. Colin had never had a woman respond to him with such honesty. It made it impossible for him to hold on to his own discipline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, you\u0027re so tight,\" he whispered, his own voice a harsh whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could barely concentrate on what he was telling her. \"You\u0027re making me ache. Please…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what she wanted from him, only knew she would go mad if he didn\u0027t do something to ease the sweet torment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped to God she was ready for him. He pulled her hands away from the sheets and wrapped them around his neck. His knee nudged her thighs wider and then his hands slid under her h*ps to hold her close. The tip of his arousal was surrounded by her liquid heat. He slowly pressed inside her, paused when he felt the barrier of her virginity, and then tried to gently push past the obstacle. The barrier wouldn\u0027t give. Colin\u0027s jaw was clenched tight and his breathing was as ragged as though he\u0027d just run a mile, for the pleasure was already so intense he could barely hold on to what little control he had left. He knew he was hurting her. She cried out against his mouth and tried to push him away at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe soothed her with honeyed words. \"Sweetheart, it\u0027s going to be all right. The pain won\u0027t last long. Hold on to me. Oh, baby, don\u0027t move like that… not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to be gentle was only prolonging the pain for her… and it was killing him. His forehead was covered with perspiration and he knew he would go completely out of his mind if he didn\u0027t bury himself deep inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted his hold on her, lifted her hips, then thrust deep with one powerful surge. She cried out, her pain as intense now as his pleasure, and tried to push away from him again. His weight wouldn\u0027t allow any movement. His possession was complete and, dear God, she fit him like a second skin. He fought the urge to partially withdraw and then thrust back into her, for he wanted to give her time to adjust to him. Her nails scored his shoulderblades and he knew she was trying to get him to let her go. Colin tried to capture her mouth for another searing kiss, but she turned her head away from him. He kissed her ear instead, then her cheek, trying his damnedest to hold on to the remnants of his control long enough to rekindle the passion inside her. Tears streamed down her face and she let out a little broken sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, don\u0027t cry. I\u0027m sorry. God, I had to hurt you. It\u0027s going to get better in just a few minutes. You feel so damned good. Hold me, baby. Hold me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worry in his voice soothed her far more than his words. Pleasure warred with pain. She was so confused by the conflicting feelings, she didn\u0027t know what to do. She wanted him to stop and yet she wanted him to stay joined with her too. His breath was hot against her ear. Harsh, too. The sound excited her. She didn\u0027t understand what was happening to her. Her body was demanding release, but release from what? She didn\u0027t know. The urge to move was suddenly there, and every nerve inside her clamored in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to move.\" Her voice was a bare whisper of confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin leaned up on his elbows to look at her. Her eyes shimmered with passion, but more important to him, she\u0027d quit crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to move, too. I want to pull out, then sink deep inside you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was rough with emotion. She instinctively squeezed him tight. She decided to test just to make certain it really had gotten better. She\u0027d felt as though he\u0027d torn her apart a minute ago, but now the throbbing wasn\u0027t as intense, and when she moved restlessly against him, pain didn\u0027t result. The touch of splendor caught her by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s starting to feel… nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all the permission he needed. His control snapped. His mouth covered hers in a ravenous kiss. The hunger inside him raged out of control. He slowly withdrew from her, then thrust deep inside. The mating ritual consumed him, and when she tightened around him again and lifted her h*ps up to meet his thrusts, he buried his face against the side of her neck and let out a raw groan. The pressure building inside him was excruciatingly beautiful. Colin had never experienced anything like this before. Alesandra was like fire in his arms, and her wild, uninhibited response shook him to his very soul. She held nothing back, and that selfless act forced him to do the same. The bed squeaked in protest as he thrust inside her again and again. He was mindless to everything but giving both of them fulfillment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came upon them in a rush. She found her release first and when she instinctively squeezed him tight and arched against him, he gave in to his own orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her a long while to come back to reality. She clung to her husband and let the waves of blissful surrender wash over her. A part of her mind understood that as long as she was holding Colin, she was safe. She didn\u0027t have to worry about control. He would take care of her. Alesandra closed her eyes and let the wonder of their lovemaking consume her every thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never felt this safe, this free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin was experiencing the opposite reaction. He was shaken by what had just happened to him, for he\u0027d never allowed himself to completely abandon his control. Never. It scared the hell out of him. Her silky thighs had squeezed every thought out of his mind. She was the innocent, he experienced, and yet she\u0027d been able to strip him of all his defenses. He hadn\u0027t been able to hold a part of himself back and toward the end, when they were both reaching for their fulfillment, he had been as much at her mercy as she at his—and, God help him, it had never been this good before. It scared the hell out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in his life he felt vulnerable, trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still joined together. Colin slowly withdrew before the feel of her made him hard again. He gritted his teeth against the pleasure that movement caused. He didn\u0027t have the strength to move away from her yet, but he knew his weight was probably crushing her. Her arms were wrapped around his neck. He reached up and gently pulled them away. He leaned down to kiss the base of her throat, felt her frantic heartbeat, and found arrogant male satisfaction then, for he realized she hadn\u0027t completely recovered either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later he rolled onto his back, away from her. He took a deep, shuddering breath and closed his eyes. The scent of their lovemaking permeated the air around them. The taste of her was still in his mouth and, God help him, he could feel himself getting hard again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra finally roused herself from her thoughts and turned to him. She propped herself up on one elbow to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scowl stunned her. \"Colin?\" she whispered. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head to look at her. Within a bare second, his expression changed. Colin wasn\u0027t about to let her see his vulnerability. He smiled at her and then reached over to brush the back of his hand against the side of her face. She leaned into his caress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m supposed to ask you if you\u0027re all right,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked more than all right to him. Her eyes were still shimmering with passion, her mouth looked swollen from his kisses, her hair was draped over one shoulder, and Colin thought she was the sexiest woman in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hurt you, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly nodded. She noticed he didn\u0027t seem overly worried about that fact. \"I was…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed. He laughed. Then he pulled her into his arms and let her hide her face against his chest. \"It\u0027s a little late to become embarrassed, isn\u0027t it? Or have you forgotten how wild you were a few minutes ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t forgotten. She blushed to the roots of her hair just thinking about her wanton reaction. His chest rumbled with amusement. She didn\u0027t mind that he was laughing at her. The most wonderful thing in the world had just happened to her and she wasn\u0027t going to let anything ruin it. A warm glow still surrounded her, making her feel both blissful and sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t very dignified, was I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean you weren\u0027t dignified when you begged me not to stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed her backside in a lazy fashion while he waited for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did do that, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wonder in her voice made him smile. \"Yes,\" he drawled out. \"You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"It was nice, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"It was a whole lot better than nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong minutes passed in silence. He broke the peaceful interlude when he let out a loud yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin? Did I… was I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t seem to finish her question. Her own vulnerability made her too timid to find out if she had been satisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what she needed from him now. \"Alesandra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he whispered her name felt like a caress. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good of you to say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe relaxed against him and closed her eyes. The sound of his heartbeat mingled with his soft laughter soothed her. His one hand stroked her back and his other gently rubbed her neck. She was just drifting off to sleep when he called her name again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to begin explaining now?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-24.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
