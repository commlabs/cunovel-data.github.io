{"id":20234,"no":36,"title":"THE OUTLAWED ARCHERS.","content":"Many years ago there dwelt in the forest of Inglewood, in the North country, three yeomen, who had been outlawed for killing the king\u0027s deer. They were all famous archers, and defying every attempt to arrest them, they lived a free life in the green wood. But finally growing tired of this dangerous life, they went to the king to sue for pardon. It happened that the king\u0027s archers were exhibiting their skill by shooting at marks, which none of them missed. But one of the outlawed archers, named Cloudesly, made light of their skill, and told the king that he could do better than any of his archers had done. \"To prove the truth of my claim,\" he said, \"I will take my son, who is only seven years old and is dear to me, and I will tie him to a stake, and lay an apple on his head, and go six score paces from him, and with a broad arrow I will cleave the apple in two.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now listen,\" said the king, \"and do as you say; but if you touch his head, or his dress, you shall be hanged all three.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will not go back on my word,\" said Cloudesly; and driving a stake into the ground, he bound thereto his little son, and placed an apple on his head. All being ready he bent his bow, the arrow flew from the string, the apple was cleft in twain, and the child was unhurt. The king thereupon pardoned the three outlaws and received them into his service.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2154/60915.html","bookId":596,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:35:23 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:35:23 AM"}
