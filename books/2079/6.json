It left tingling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein its wake. But the real shock was in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind exploded. That was the only way she could describe it. A noiseless, heatless explosion that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshattered her completely. All at once, Rashel couldn\u0027t support her own weight anymore. She could feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s arms supporting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no sense of the room around her. She was floating in a white light and the only solid thing to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehang on to was Quinn. It was something like the terror she\u0027d felt before... but it wasn\u0027t just terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossibly, what she felt was more like wild elation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that Quinn was holding her so tightly that it hurt. But even stronger than the sensation of his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earms was the sense she had of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA direct conduit seemed to have opened between them. She could feel his astonishment, his shock, his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewonder. And she knew he could feel hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s telepathy, some distant part of herself said, trying desperately to get control again. It\u0027s some new\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she knew it wasn\u0027t a trick. Quinn was as astounded as she was-she could feel that. Maybe he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven worse off. He was breathing rapidly and shallowly and a fine trembling seemed to have taken over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel held on to him, thinking crazy things. She wanted to comfort him. She could sense, probably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetter than he could himself, how frighteningly vulnerable he was under that frozen exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me, I suppose, Rashel thought giddily. And then she suddenly realized that he was feeling her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evulnerability just as she had felt his. Fear welled up in her so sharply that she panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to find a way to shut him out, to resist the way she resisted mind control-but she knew it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euseless. He had gotten past her guard already. He was inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Quinn said, and she realized that he had stopped trembling. His voice was almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edispassionate, and at the same time madly gentle. Rashel had the feeling that he\u0027d decided that since he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t fight this thing, he might as well be as insane as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangest of all, she found his words reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was fire under the ice that seemed to encase him. She could feel that now, and she had the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edizzy sense that she was the first one to discover it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had fallen to the floor somehow, and they were sitting just at the edge of the light. Quinn was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eholding her by the shoulders, precisely, and Rashel was astonished at her own response to the clinical\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrip. It stopped her breath, held her absolutely motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, just as precisely, every movement deliberate, Quinn found the end of her scarf and began to unwind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still filled with that mad gentleness, that lunatic calm. And she wasn\u0027t stopping him. He was going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto expose her face, and she wasn\u0027t doing a thing about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted him to. In spite of her terror, she wanted him to see her, to know who she was. She wanted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be face to face with him in that strange light that had enveloped both their minds. It didn\u0027t seem to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ematter what happened afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unwound another length of the scarf, preoccupied and intent as if he were making some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earchaeological discovery. \"You didn\u0027t tell me your name.\" It was a statement. He wasn\u0027t pushing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might as well write it out on a death warrant and hand it to him. Quinn could reveal himself to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumans-but then Quinn could disappear completely if he wanted, hole up in some hidden vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenclave where no human could search him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel couldn\u0027t. He knew she was a vampire hunter. If he knew her name and her face, he\u0027d have every\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epower to destroy her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the scariest thing of all was that some part of her didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was down to the last turn of the scarf. In a moment her face would be exposed to the air... and to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire eyes that could see in this darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m Rashel, Rashel thought. She couldn\u0027t quite get the words to her lips. She took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the same instant a light blazed into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the ghostly light that had been in her mind. Real light, the beams from several high-power flashlights,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eharsh and horribly bright. They cut through the dark cellar and threw Rashel and Quinn into stark illumination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel gasped. One hand instinctively flew to her scarf to keep it over her face. She felt as if she had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen caught naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was horrified to realize that she hadn\u0027t heard anyone come into the cellar. She had been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompletely absorbed, oblivious to her surroundings. What had happened to all her training? What was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t see anything beyond the light. Her first thought was that it was Quinn\u0027s vampire Mends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome to save him. He seemed to think it might be, too; at least he was standing shoulder to shoulder with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher, even trying to push her back a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an odd pang, Rashel realized she could only guess what he was thinking now. The connection\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetween them had been cleanly severed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a voice came from beyond the terrible brightness, a sharp voice filled with outrage. \"How did he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget loose? What are you two doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky. I\u0027m going insane, Rashel thought. I completely forgot about her and the others coming back. No,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot about their existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were more than three flashlights on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Big E sent us some backup,\" Vicky was saying, and Rashel felt a surge of fear. She counted five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflashlights, and in the edges of beams she caught the figures of a couple of sturdy-looking guys. Lancers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel tried desperately to gather her wits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what had to be done, at least. She nudged Quinn with her shoulder and whispered, \"Get out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof here. There should be another stairway on the other side of the room. When you run for it, I\u0027ll get in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir way.\" She pitched her voice so low that only vampire ears could hear it. The good thing about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehaving her face veiled was that nobody could read her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Quinn wasn\u0027t going. He looked as if he\u0027d just been awakened with a bucketful of ice water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, angry, and still a little dazed. He stood where he was, staring into all the flashlights like an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanimal at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights were advancing. Rashel could make out Vicky\u0027s figure now at the front. There was going to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea fight, and people were going to get killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve\u0027s voice said, \"What did he do to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she been doing with him, that\u0027s the question,\" Vicky snapped back. Then she said clearly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, everybody, we want him alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel gave Quinn a harder shove. \"Go.\" When he just glared, she hissed, \"Don\u0027t you realize what they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to do to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn turned so that the advancing party couldn\u0027t see his face. He snarled, \"They\u0027re not exactly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoverjoyed with you either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can take care of myself.\" Rashel was shaking with frustration. \"Just leave. Go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn looked as angry with her as he was with the hunters. He didn\u0027t want her help, she realized. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t used to taking anything from anyone, and to be forced to do it made him furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there wasn\u0027t any other choice. And Quinn finally seemed to recognize that. With one last glare at her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe broke and headed for the darkness at the other side of the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashlights swung in confusion. Rashel, glad to be able to move, sprang between the vampire hunters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the stairway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was a lot of fumbling and crashing, with people running into each other and swearing and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyelling. Rashel enjoyed the chance to work off her frustration. She got in everyone\u0027s way long enough for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea very fast vampire to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter which it was just her and the vampire hunters. Five flashlights turned on her and seven amazed and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eangry people staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel got up and brushed herself off. Time to face the consequences. She stood, head high, looking at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Steve said. \"Did he hypnotize you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood old Steve. Rashel felt a rush of warmth toward him. But she couldn\u0027t use the out he was offering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. She said, \"I don\u0027t know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was true. She couldn\u0027t even begin to explain to herself what had gone on between her and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire. She\u0027d never heard of anything like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you let him get away on purpose,\" Vicky said. Rashel couldn\u0027t see Vicky\u0027s pale blue eyes, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe sensed that they were as hard as marbles. \"I think you planned it from the beginning-that\u0027s why you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etold us to go up to the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true?\" One of the flashlights swung down and suddenly Nyala was in front of Rashel, her body\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etense, her voice almost pleading. Her eyes were fixed on Rashel\u0027s, begging Rashel to say it wasn\u0027t so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you do it on purpose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once Rashel felt very tired. Nyala was fragile and unstable, and in her own mind she\u0027d made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel into a hero. Now that image was being shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Nyala\u0027s sake, Rashel almost wished she could lie. But that would be worse in the end. She said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpressionlessly, \"Yes. I did it on purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNyala recoiled as if Rashel had slapped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t blame you, Rashel thought. I think it\u0027s crazy, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that the farther away she got from Quinn\u0027s presence, the less she could understand what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d done. It was beginning to seem like a dream, and not a very clear dream at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" one of the Lancer boys at the back asked. The Lancers knew Rashel, knew her reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t want to think the worst of her. Like Nyala, they desperately wanted an excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why,\" Rashel said, looking away. \"But he wasn\u0027t controlling my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNyala exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you,\" she burst out. She was trembling with fury, spitting out sentences at Rashel like poison\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarts. \"That vampire could have been the one who killed my sister. Or he could have known who did it. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas going to ask him that, but now I\u0027ll never get the chance. Because of you. You let him go. We had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim and you let him go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more than that,\" Vicky put in, her voice cold and contemptuous. \"We were going to ask him about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethose teenage girls getting kidnapped. Now we can\u0027t. So it\u0027s going to keep happening, and it\u0027s all going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were right. Even Nyala was right. How did Rashel know that Quinn hadn\u0027t killed Nyala\u0027s sister?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a vampire lover,\" Vicky was saying. \"I could tell from the beginning. I don\u0027t know, maybe you\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone of those damned Daybreakers who wants us all to get along, but you\u0027re not on our side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of the Lancers started to protest at this, but Nyala\u0027s voice cut through them. \"She\u0027s on their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eside?\" She stared from Vicky to Rashel, her body rigid. \"You just wait. Just wait until I tell people that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel is the Cat and that she\u0027s really on the Night World side. You just wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s hysterical, Rashel realized. Even Vicky was looking surprised at this, as if she were uneasy at what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d started. \"Nyala, listen-\" Rashel began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nyala seemed to have reached some peak of fury at which nothing from outside could touch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell everybody in Boston! You\u0027ll see!\" She whirled around and plunged toward the stairway as if she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere going to start doing it right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stared after her. Then she said to Vicky, \"You\u0027d better send a couple of the guys to catch up to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. She\u0027s not safe alone in this neighborhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky gave her a look that was half angry and half shaken. \"Yeah. Okay. Everybody but Steve go after\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. You guys take her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left, not without a few backward glances at Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll drive you back,\" Vicky said. Her voice wasn\u0027t warm, but it wasn\u0027t as hostile as it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll walk to my own car,\" Rashel said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" Vicky hesitated, then blurted, \"She probably won\u0027t do what she said. She\u0027s just upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel said nothing. Nyala had sounded-and looked-as if she meant to do exactly what she said. And if she did...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it would be an interesting question as to who would kill Rashel first, the vampires or the vampire hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday morning dawned with gray skies and icy rain. Rashel trudged from class to class at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWassa-guscus High, lost in thought. At home, her latest foster family left her alone-they were used to her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing her own way. She sat in her small bedroom in the townhouse with the lights dimmed, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still couldn\u0027t understand what had happened to her, but with every hour the memory of it was fading\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esteadily. It was too strange to fit into the reality of life, and it became more and more like a dream. One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof those dreams in which you do things you would never ordinarily do, and are ashamed of when you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewake up in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that warmth and closeness-she\u0027d felt that for a vampire? She\u0027d been excited by a parasite\u0027s touch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d wanted to comfort a leech?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not just any leech, either. The infamous Quinn. The legendary human hater. How could she have let\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim go? How many people would suffer because of her lapse in sanity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knows, she decided finally, maybe it had been some kind of mind control. She certainly couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake any sense of it otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Thursday, one thing at least was clear in her mind. Vicky had been right about the consequences of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat she\u0027d done. Rashel hadn\u0027t thought about that at the time, but now she had to face it. She had to make it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to find the kidnapped girls on her own- if girls were getting kidnapped. There was nothing about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emissing teenagers in the Globe. But if it was happening, Rashel had to find out about it and stop it... if she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. So she\u0027d go back to Mission Hill tonight and start investigating. Check the warehouse area\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain-this time, her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one other thing that was clear to her, that became obvious as she got her priorities straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething she had to do, not for Nyala, or for Vicky, or for the Lancers, but just for herself. For her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown honor, and for everybody who lived in the world of sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time she saw Quinn, she had to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel moved along the deserted street, keeping to the shadows, moving silently. Not easy when the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eground was wet and strewn with broken glass. There were no sidewalks, no grass, no plant life of any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekind except the dead weeds in the abandoned lots. Just soggy trash and shattered bottles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grim place. It fit Rashel\u0027s mood as she made her way stealthily toward the abandoned project\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuilding where Vicky had brought them Tuesday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom its front door, she surveyed the rest of the street. Lots of warehouses. Several of them were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprotected with high chain-link fences topped with barbed wire. All of them had barred windows-or no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewindows-and metal freight doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security precautions didn\u0027t bother Rashel. She knew how to cut chain-link and pick locks. What\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebothered her was that she didn\u0027t know where to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Night People could be using any of the warehouses. Even knowing where Steve and Vicky had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efought Quinn didn\u0027t help, because he had jumped them. He\u0027d obviously seen them lying in ambush and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeliberately gone after them. Which meant his real destination could have been any of the buildings on this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estreet-or none of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. Patience was indicated here. She\u0027d just have to start at one end . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel lost her thought and leaped back into the shadows before she consciously realized why she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing it. Her ears had picked up a sound-a low rumbling coming from somewhere across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flattened herself against the brick wall behind her, then kept her body absolutely immobile. Her eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarted from building to building and she held her breath to hear better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. It was coming from inside that warehouse, the one down at the far end of the street. And she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould identify it now-the sound of an engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she watched, the freight door in the front of the warehouse went sliding up. Headlights pierced the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enight from behind it. A truck was pulling out onto the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a very big truck. A U-Haul. It cleared the doors and stopped. A figure was pulling the sliding metal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoor down. Now it was making its way to the cab of the U-Haul, climbing in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel strained her eyes, trying to make out any signs of vampirism in the figure\u0027s movements. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought she could detect a certain telltale fluidity to the walk, but it was too far away to be sure. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was nothing else to give her a clue about what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be a human, she thought. Some warehouse owner going home after a night of balancing books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her instinct told her differently. The hair at the back of her neck was standing on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as the truck began to cruise off, something happened that settled her doubts and sent her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflying down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back doors of the U-Haul opened just a bit, and a girl fell out. She was slender, and a streetlight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecaught her blond hair. She landed on the rubble-strewn road and lay there for an instant as if dazed. Then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe jumped up, looked around wildly, and started running in Rashel\u0027s direction. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-6.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
