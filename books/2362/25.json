She knew only that her husband intended to destroy her brother and she could not let that happen. Somehow, Costa had to be stopped. Her life no longer mattered. Her days and nights were filled with pain and humiliation. She remembered how Spyros had tried to warn her against the marriage. You can\u0027t marry Demiris. He\u0027s a monster. He\u0027ll destroy you. How right he had been. And she had been too much in love to listen. Now her husband had to be destroyed. But how? Think like Costa. And she had. By morning, Melina had worked out all the details. After that, the rest had been simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstantin Demiris was in his study working when Melina walked in. She was carrying a package tied with a heavy cord. She held a large butcher knife in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Costa, would you mind cutting this open for me? I can\u0027t seem to manage it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at her and said impatiently, \"Of course you can\u0027t. Don\u0027t you know better than to hold a knife by the blade?\" He snatched the knife from her and started to cut the cord. \"Couldn\u0027t you have had one of the servants do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemiris finished cutting the cord. \"There!\" He put the knife down and Melina carefully picked it up by the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him and said, \"Costa, we can\u0027t go on this way. I still love you. You must still feel something for me. Do you remember the wonderful times we used to have together? Do you remember the night of our honeymoon when...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Demiris snapped. \"Don\u0027t you understand? It\u0027s over. I\u0027m finished with you. Get out of here, you make me sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina stood there staring at him. Finally, she said quietly, \"All right. Have it your way.\" She turned and left the room carrying the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot your package,\" Demiris shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina went into her husband\u0027s dressing room and opened a closet door. There were a hundred suits hanging in the closet with a special section for sports jackets. She reached for one of the jackets and tore a gold button from it. She put the button in her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext she opened a drawer and removed a pair of her husband\u0027s bathing trunks with his initials on them. I\u0027m almost ready, Melina thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Katelanos Detective Agency was located on Sofokleous Street in a faded old brick building on the corner. Melina was ushered into the office of the owner of the agency, Mr. Katelanos, a small bald man with a tiny mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Mrs. Demiris. And what can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of protection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatelanos frowned. He smelled trouble. This was not at all the kind of case he had anticipated. It would be very unwise to do anything that might offend a man as powerful as Constantin Demiris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought of going to the police?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I don\u0027t want any publicity. I want to keep this private. I told my husband I was going to divorce him, and he threatened to kill me if I went through with it. That\u0027s why I came to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. What exactly is it you wish me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to assign some men to protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatelanos sat there studying her. She\u0027s a beautiful woman, he thought. Obviously neurotic. It was inconceivable that her husband would harm her. This was probably some little domestic spat that would blow over in a few days. But meanwhile, he would be able to charge her a nice fee. On balance, Katelanos decided it was worth the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said. \"I have a good man I can assign to you. When would you like him to start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he was right. There was no urgency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina Demiris rose. \"I will give you a call. Do you have a business card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\" Katelanos handed her his business card and ushered her out. She\u0027s a good client to have, he thought. Her name will impress my other clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Melina returned home, she telephoned her brother. \"Spyros, I have some good news.\" Her voice was filled with excitement. \"Costa wants a truce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I don\u0027t trust him, Melina. It must be some kind of trick. He...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He means it. He realizes that it\u0027s stupid for you two to be fighting all the time. He wants to have peace in the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least give him a chance. He wants you to meet him at your lodge at Acrocorinth at three o\u0027clock this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a three-hour drive. Why can\u0027t we meet in town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say,\" Melina told him, \"but if it\u0027s going to mean peace...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027ll do it. But I\u0027m doing it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For us,\" Melina said. \"Good-bye, Spyros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina telephoned Constantin at the office. His voice was abrupt. \"What is it? I\u0027m busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just received a call from Spyros. He wants to make peace with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short, derisive laugh. \"I\u0027ll bet he does. When I\u0027m through with him he\u0027ll have all the peace he\u0027ll ever want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he\u0027s not going to compete with you any more, Costa. He\u0027s willing to sell you his fleet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sell me his...Are you sure?\" His voice was suddenly filled with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He said he\u0027s had enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Tell him to send his accountants over to my office, and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He wants to meet with you this afternoon at three o\u0027clock at Acrocorinth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His lodge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s a secluded place. It will be just the two of you. He doesn\u0027t want word of this to get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll bet he doesn\u0027t, Demiris thought with satisfaction. When word does get out, he will be a laughingstock. \"All right,\" Demiris said. \"You can tell him I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive to Acrocorinth was a long one, on winding roads that meandered through the lush countryside, redolent with the odors of grapes and lemons and hay. Spyros Lambrou passed ancient ruins along the way. In the distance, he saw the fallen pillars of Elefsis, the ruined altars of lesser gods. He thought of Demiris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLambrou was the first to arrive at the lodge. He pulled up in front of the cabin and sat in the car for a moment, thinking about the meeting he was about to have. Did Constantin really want a truce, or was this another one of his tricks? If anything happened to him, at least Melina knew where he had gone. Spyros got out of the car and walked into the deserted lodge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lodge was a lovely old wooden building with a view of Corinth in the distance below. As a boy, Spyros Lambrou had spent weekends there with his father, hunting small game in the mountains. Now he was after bigger game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, Constantin Demiris arrived. He saw Spyros inside, waiting there, and it gave him a glow of satisfaction. So, after all these years, the man is finally willing to admit he is defeated. He got out of his car and walked into the cabin. The two men stood there, staring at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, my dear brother-in-law,\" Demiris said, \"so we\u0027ve finally reached the end of the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want this madness to end, Costa. It\u0027s gone too far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t agree with you more. How many ships do you have, Spyros?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLambrou looked at him in surprise. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many ships do you have? I\u0027ll purchase them all. At a substantial discount, naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLambrou could not believe what he was hearing. \"Purchase my ships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m willing to buy all of them. It will make me the largest fleet owner in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy? What - what makes you think I would sell you my ships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Demiris\u0027s turn to react. \"That\u0027s why we\u0027re meeting here, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re meeting here because you asked for a truce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemiris\u0027s face darkened. \"I - who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth dawned on both of them at the same moment. \"She told you I wanted a truce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told you I wanted to sell my ships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stupid bitch,\" Demiris exclaimed. \"I suppose she thought that by bringing us together we would reach some sort of agreement. She\u0027s a bigger fool than you are, Lambrou. I\u0027ve wasted a whole afternoon on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstantin Demiris turned and stormed out the door. Spyros Lambrou looked after him, thinking, Melina shouldn\u0027t have lied to us. She should have known that there\u0027s no way her husband and I could ever get together. Not now. It\u0027s too late. It was always too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 1:30, earlier that afternoon, Melina had rung for the maid. \"Andrea, would you bring me some tea, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly, ma\u0027am.\" The maid left the room, and when she returned with the tea tray ten minutes later, her mistress was speaking into the telephone. Her tone was angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Costa, I\u0027ve made up my mind. I intend to divorce you and I\u0027m going to make it as messy and as public as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassed, Andrea set the tray down and started to retreat. Melina waved to her to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina spoke into the dead phone. \"You can threaten me all you like. I\u0027m not going to change my mind...Never...I don\u0027t care what you say...You don\u0027t frighten me, Costa...No...What would be the point?...All right. I\u0027ll meet you at the beach house, but it won\u0027t do you any good. Yes, I\u0027ll come alone. In an hour? Very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Melina replaced the receiver, a worried look on her face. She turned to Andrea. \"I\u0027m going to the beach house to meet my husband. If I haven\u0027t returned by six o\u0027clock, I want you to call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea swallowed nervously. \"Would you like the chauffeur to drive you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Mr. Demiris asked me to come alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one more thing to do. Catherine Alexander\u0027s life was in danger. She had to be warned. It was someone from the delegation that had had dinner at the house. You won\u0027t see her again. I\u0027ve sent someone to get rid of her. Melina placed a call to her husband\u0027s offices in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a Catherine Alexander working there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not in at the moment. Can anyone else help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina hesitated. Her message was too urgent to trust to just anyone, but she would have no time to call back. She remembered Costa mentioning a Wim Vandeen, a genius in the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could I speak with Mr. Vandeen, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man\u0027s voice came on the line. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could barely understand him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a message for Catherine Alexander. It\u0027s very important. Would you see that she gets it, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catherine Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Tell her - tell her that her life is in danger. Someone is going to try to kill her. I think it could be one of the men who came from Athens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Athens...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Athens has a population of eight hundred six thousand...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina could not seem to make the man understand. She hung up the phone. She had tried her best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWim sat at his desk, digesting the telephone conversation. Someone is going to try to kill Catherine. A hundred and fourteen murders were committed in England this year, Catherine will make it a hundred and fifteen. One of the men who came from Athens. Jerry Haley. Yves Renard. Dino Mattusi. One of them is going to kill Catherine. Wim\u0027s computer mind instantly fed him all the data on the three men. I think I know which one it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Catherine returned later, Wim said nothing to her about the phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was curious to see if he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine was out with a different member of the delegation every evening, and when she came to work each morning, Wim was there, waiting. He seemed disappointed to see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen is she going to let him do it? Wim wondered. Maybe he should tell her about the telephone message. But that would be cheating. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to change the odds. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-25.html","bookId":2362,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM"}
