How do I look?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a woman,” she sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s seven-thirty sharp so I go to the living room, grab the jacket Will insisted I borrow the day before and head to the window. He\u0027s coming out of his house so I walk outside and stand in my driveway. He looks up and notices me as he\u0027s opening his car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready?\" he yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, come on then!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t move. I just stand there and fold my arms across my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" He throws his hand up in defeat and laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you would pick me up at seven-thirty! I\u0027m waiting for you to pick me up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins as he gets in the car. He backs straight out of his driveway and into mine so that the passenger door is closest to me. He hops out of the car and runs around to open it. Before I get in I give him the onceover. He’s wearing loose fitted jeans and a black long sleeved shirt that outlines his arms. It\u0027s the defined arms that prompt me to return his jacket to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That reminds me,” I say as I hand him his jacket. “I bought this for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs the jacket and slides his arms inside. “Wow, it even smells like me,” he laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waits until I\u0027ve buckled up before he shuts the door. As he\u0027s walking around to his side, I notice the car smells like...cheese. Not old, stale cheese; but fresh cheese, cheddar maybe. My stomach growls. I\u0027m curious where we\u0027re going to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Will gets in, he reaches into the backseat and grabs a sack. \"We don\u0027t have time to eat, so I made us grilled cheese.\" He hands me a sandwich and a bottle of soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. This is a first,\" I say as I stare at the items in my hands. \"And where exactly are we going in such a hurry?” I twist open my lid. \"It\u0027s obviously not a restaurant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unwraps his sandwich and takes a bite. \"It\u0027s a surprise,\" he says with a mouthful of bread. He navigates the steering wheel with his free hand as he simultaneously drives and eats. \"I know a lot more about you than you know about me, so tonight I want to show you what I\u0027m all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m intrigued,\" I say. I really am intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both finish our sandwiches and I put the trash back in the bag and place it in the backseat. I try to think of something to say to break the silence, so I ask him about his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are your parents like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a deep breath and slowly exhales. \"I\u0027m not big on small talk, Lake. We can figure all that out later. Let\u0027s make this drive interesting,\" he says as he relaxes further into his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving, no talking, keeping it interesting. I\u0027m repeating what he said in my head and hope I’m misunderstanding his intent. He laughs when he sees the hesitation on my face and it dawns on him that I\u0027ve taken what he said out of context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lake, No!\" he laughs. \"I just meant let’s talk about something besides what we’re expected to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathe a sigh of relief. I thought I had found his flaw. \"Good,\" I laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a game we can play. It\u0027s called \u0027would you rather.\u0027 Have you played it before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"No, but I know I would rather you go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He clears his throat and pauses for a few seconds. \"Okay, would you rather spend the rest of your life with no arms; or would you rather spend the rest of your life with arms you couldn\u0027t control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? I can honestly say this date has definitely not started the way any of my previous dates have gone. It\u0027s pleasantly unexpected though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well…\" I hesitate. \"I guess I would rather spend the rest of my life with arms I couldn\u0027t control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Seriously? But you wouldn\u0027t be controlling them!\" he says, flapping his arms around in the car. \"They could be flailing around and you\u0027d be constantly punching yourself in the face! Or worse, you might grab a knife and stab yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t realize there were right and wrong answers,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You suck at this!\" he teases. \"Your turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let me think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to have one ready!\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, Will! I barely heard of this game for the first time thirty seconds ago. Give me a second to think of one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches over and squeezes my hand. \"I\u0027m teasing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe repositions his hand underneath mine and our fingers interlock. I like how easy the transition is, like we\u0027ve been holding hands for years. So far, everything about this date has been easy. I like Will\u0027s sense of humor. I like that I find it so easy to laugh around him after having gone so many months without laughing. I like that we\u0027re holding hands. I really like that we\u0027re holding hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ve got one,\" I say. \"Would you rather pee on yourself once a day at random, unknown times? Or would you rather have to pee on someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends on who I\u0027d have to pee on. Can I pee on people I don’t like? Or is it random people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Random people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pee on myself,\" he says without hesitation. \"My turn now. Would you rather be four feet tall, or seven feet tall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven feet tall,\" I reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t allowed to ask why,\" I say. \"Okay, let’s see. Would you rather drink an entire gallon of bacon grease for breakfast every day? Or would you rather have to eat five pounds of popcorn for supper every night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five pounds of popcorn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the game we’re playing. I like that he didn’t worry about impressing me with dinner. I like that I have no idea where we\u0027re headed. I even like that he didn’t compliment what I was wearing, which seems to be the standard opening line for dates. So far, I like everything about tonight. As far as I’m concerned, we could drive around for another two hours just playing ‘would you rather’-and it would be the most fun I’ve ever had on a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, we don’t. We eventually reach our destination and I immediately tense up when I see the sign on the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClub N9NE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, Will? I don\u0027t dance.\" I\u0027m hoping he\u0027ll be empathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, neither do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exit the vehicle and meet at the front of the car. I\u0027m not sure who reached out first, but once again our fingers find each other in the dark and he holds my hand as he guides me toward the entrance. As we get closer to the entrance, I notice a sign posted on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosed for Slam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursdays\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:00-Whenever\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmission: Free\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFee to slam: $3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill opens the door without reading the sign. I start to inform him the club is closed but he seems like he knows what he\u0027s doing. The silence is interrupted by the energy of the crowd as I follow him through the entryway and into the room. There is an empty stage to the right of us, with tables and chairs set up all over the dance floor. The place is packed. I see a table toward the front that looks like a group of younger kids, around age fourteen or so. Will turns to the left and heads to an empty booth in the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quieter back here,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old do you have to be to get into clubs here?\" I ask, still observing the group of out of place children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, tonight it\u0027s not a club,\" he says as we scoot into the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a half circle booth facing the stage so I scoot all the way to the middle to get the best view. He moves in right beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s slam night,\" he says. \"Every Thursday they shut the club down and people come here to compete in the slam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s a slam?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s poetry,\" he says as he smiles at me. \"It\u0027s what I\u0027m all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he for real? A hot guy who makes me laugh and loves poetry? Someone pinch me. Or not; I\u0027d rather not wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poetry, huh?\" I say. \"Do people write their own or do they get it from other authors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans back in the seat and looks up at the stage. I can see the passion in his eyes when he talks about it. \"People get up there and pour their hearts out just using their words and the movement of their bodies,\" he says. \"It\u0027s amazing. You aren\u0027t going to hear any Dickinson or Frost here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it like a competition?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s complicated,\" he says. \"It differs between every club. Normally during a slam, the judges are picked at random from the audience and they assign points to each performance. The one with the most points at the end of the night wins. That\u0027s how they do it here, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you slam?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes. Sometimes I judge, sometimes I just watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you performing tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. Just an observer tonight. I don\u0027t really have anything ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m disappointed. It would be amazing to see him perform on stage. I still have no idea what slam poetry is, but I\u0027m really curious to see him do anything that requires a performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bummer,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want something to drink?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ll take some chocolate milk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chocolate milk? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he says as he slides out of the booth. \"One chocolate milk on the rocks coming right up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he\u0027s gone, the emcee comes to the stage and attempts to pump up the crowd. No one is in the back of the room where we\u0027re seated, so I feel a little silly when I yell \u0027yeah!\u0027 with the rest of the crowd. I sink further into my seat and decide just to be a spectator for the remainder of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emcee announces it’s time to pick the judges and the entire crowd roars, almost everyone wanting to be chosen. They pick five people at random and move them to the judging table. As Will walks back to the booth with our drinks, the emcee announces it\u0027s time for the \u0027sac,\u0027 and chooses someone at random.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the sac?\" I ask as he hands me my drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sacrifice…It\u0027s what they use to prepare the judges,\" he says as he slides back into the booth. Somehow, he slides even closer this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone performs something that isn\u0027t part of the competition so the judges can calibrate their scoring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they can call on anyone? What if they would have called on me?\" I ask, suddenly nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I guess you should have had something ready,” he says as he smiles at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a sip from his drink then leans back against the booth, finding my hand in the dark. Our fingers don\u0027t interlock this time, though. Instead, he places my hand on his leg and his fingertips start to trace the outline of my wrist. He gently traces each of my fingers, following the lines and curves of my entire hand. His fingertips feel like electric pulses penetrating my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lake,\" he says quietly as he continues to trace up my wrist and back to my fingertips with a fluid motion. \"I don’t know what it is about you…but I like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers slide between mine as he takes my hand in his and turns his attention back to the stage. I inhale and reach for my chocolate milk with my free hand, downing the entire glass. The ice feels good against my lips. It cools me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey call on a young woman who looks to be around twenty-five. She announces that she is performing a piece she wrote titled \u0027Blue Sweater.’ The lights are lowered as a spotlight is positioned on her. She raises the microphone and steps forward, staring down at the floor. A hush sweeps over the audience and the only sound in the entire room is the sound of her breath, amplified through the speakers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slammed-slammed-1/page-5.html","bookId":2779,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:11 PM"}
