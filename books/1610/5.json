They must be as countless as the grains of the sands, it seems to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ibsen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSID INSISTS ON GHOSTGIRLS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Elizabethan boy friend put his fists on his hips and laid down the law to us as if we were a lot of nervous children who\u0027d been playing too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look you, masters, this is a Recuperation Station and I am running it as such. A plague of all operations! I care not if the frame of things dis joints and the whole Change World goes to ruin, but you, warrior maid, are going to rest and drink more wine slowly before you tell your tale and your colleagues are going to be properly companioned. No questions, anyone. Beau, and you love us, give us a lively tune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaby relaxed a little and let him put his hand carefully against her back in token of support and she said grudgingly, \"All right, Fat Belly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, so help me, to the tune of the Muskrat Ramble, which I\u0027d taught Beau, we got girls for those two ETs and everybody properly paired up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight here I want to point out that a lot of the things they say in the Change World about Recuperation Stations simply aren\u0027t so\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and anyway they always leave out nine-tenths of it. The Soldiers that come through the Door are looking for a good time, sure, but they\u0027re hurt real bad too, every one of them, deep down in their minds and hearts, if not always in their bodies or so you can see it right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me, a temporal operation is no joke, and to start with, there isn\u0027t one person in a hundred who can endure to be cut from his lifeline and become a really wide-awake Doubleganger\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a Demon, that is\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;let alone a Soldier. What does a badly hurt and mixed-up creature need who\u0027s been fighting hard? One individual to look out for him and feel for him and patch him up, and it helps if the one is of the opposite sex\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s something that goes beyond species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s your basis for the Place and the wild way it goes about its work, and also for most other Recuperation Stations or Entertainment Spots. The name Entertainer can be misleading, but I like it. She\u0027s got to be a lot more than a good party girl\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or boy\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though she\u0027s got to be that too. She\u0027s got to be a nurse and a psychologist and an actress and a mother and a practical ethnologist and a lot of things with longer names\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and a reliable friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of us are all those things perfectly or even near it. We just try. But when the call comes, Entertainers have to forget grudges and gripes and envies and jealousies\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and remember, they\u0027re lively people with sharp emotions\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;because there isn\u0027t any time then for anything but help and don\u0027t ask who!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, deep inside her, a good Entertainer doesn\u0027t care who. Take the way it shaped up this time. It was pretty clear to me I ought to shift to Illy, although I wasn\u0027t quite easy in my mind about leaving Erich, because the Lunan was a long time from home and, after all, Erich was among anthropoids. Ilhilihis needed someone who was simpatico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like Illy and not just because he is a sort of tail cross between a spider monkey and a persian cat\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though that is a handsome combo when you come to think of it. I like him for himself. So when he came in all lopped and shaky after a mean operation, I was the right person to look out for him. Now I\u0027ve made my little speech and know-nothings in the Change World can go making their bum jokes. But I ask you, how could an arrangement between Illy and me be anything but Platonic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe might have had some octopoid girls and nymphs in stock\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Sid couldn\u0027t be sure until he checked\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but Ilhilihis and Sevensee voted for real people and I knew Sid saw it their way. Maud squeezed Mark\u0027s hand and tripped over to Sevensee (\"Those are sharp hoofs you got, man\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she\u0027s picked up some of my language, like she has everything else), though Beau did frown over his shoulder at Lili from the piano, maybe to argue that she ought to take on the ET, as Mark had been a real casualty and could use live nursing. But it was plain as day to anybody but Beau that Bruce and Lili were a big thing and the last to be disturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErich acted stiffly hurt at losing me, but I knew he wasn\u0027t. He thinks he has a great technique with Ghostgirls and he likes to show it off, and he really is pretty slick at it, if you go for that sort of thing and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;yang my yin!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who doesn\u0027t at times?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Sid formally wafted the Countess out of Stores\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a real blonde stunner in a white satin hobble skirt with a white egret swaying up from her tiny hat, way ahead of Maud and Lili and me when it came to looks, though transparent as cigarette smoke\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and when Erich clicked his heels and bowed over her hand and proudly conducted her to a couch, black Svengali to her Trilby, and started to German-talk some life into her with much head cocking and toothy smiling and a flow of witty flattery, and when she began to flirt back and the dream look in her eyes sharpened hungrily and focused on him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;well, then I knew that Erich was happy and felt he was doing proud by the Reichswehr. No, my little commandant wasn\u0027t worrying me on that score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark had drawn a Greek hetaera name of Phryne; I suppose not the one who maybe still does the famous courtroom striptease back in Athens, and he was waking her up with little sips of his scotch and soda, though, from some looks he\u0027d flashed, I got the idea Kaby was the kid he really went for. Sid was coaxing the fighting gal to take some high-energy bread and olives along with the wine, and, for a wonder, Doc seemed to be carrying on an animated and rational conversation with Sevensee and Maud, maybe comparing notes on the Northern Venusian Shallows, and Beau had got on to Panther Rag, and Bruce and Lili were leaning on the piano, smiling very appreciatively, but talking to each other a mile a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlly turned back from inspecting them all and squeaked, \"Animals with clothes are so refreshing, dahling! Like you\u0027re all carrying banners!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he had something there, though my banners were kind of Ash Wednesday, a charcoal gray sweater and skirt. He looked at my mouth with a tentacle to see how I was smiling and he squeaked softly, \"Do I seem dull and commonplace to you, Greta girl, because I haven\u0027t got banners? Just another Zombie from a billion years in your past, as gray and lifeless as Luna is today, not as when she was a real dreamy sister planet simply bursting with air and water and feather forests. Or am I as strangely interesting to you as you are to me, girl from a billion years in my future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Illy, you\u0027re sweet,\" I told him, giving him a little pat. I noticed his fur was still vibrating nervously and I decided to heck with Sid\u0027s orders, I\u0027m going to pump him about what he was doing with Kaby and the satyr. Couldn\u0027t have him a billion years from home and bottled up, too. Besides, I was curious. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-5.html","bookId":1610,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:29 PM"}
