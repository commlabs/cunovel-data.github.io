I slumped over on the seat and allowed the weakness I\u0027d fought in Jacob\u0027s room crush me. It was worse that I\u0027d thought - the force of it took me by surprise. Yes, I had been right to hide this from Jacob. No one should ever see this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasn\u0027t alone for very long - just exactly long enough for Alice to see me here, and then the few minutes it took him to arrive. The door creaked open, and he pulled me into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first it was worse. Because there was that smaller part of me - smaller, but getting louder and angrier every minute, screaming at the rest of me - that craved a different set of arms. So then there was fresh guilt to season the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything, he just let me sob until I began to blubber out Charlie\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really ready to go home?\" he asked doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to convey, after several attempts, that it wasn\u0027t going to get any better anytime soon. I needed to get past Charlie before it got late enough for him to call Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he drove me home - for once not even getting close to my truck\u0027s internal speed limit - keeping one arm wrapped tightly around me. The whole way, I fought for control. It seemed to be a doomed effort at first, but I didn\u0027t give up. Just a few seconds, I told myself. Just time for a few excuses, or a few lies, and then I could break down again. I had to be able to do that much. I scrambled around in my head, searching desperately for a reserve of strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just enough for me to quiet the sobs - hold them back but not end them. The tears didn\u0027t slow. I couldn\u0027t seem to find any handle to even begin to work with those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for me upstairs,\" I mumbled when we were in front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugged me closer for one minute, and then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, I headed straight for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Charlie called after me from his usual place on the sofa as I walked by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to look at him without speaking. His eyes bugged wide, and he lurched to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? Is Jacob . . . ?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head furiously, trying to find my voice. \"He\u0027s fine, he\u0027s fine,\" I promised, my voice low and husky. And Jacob was fine, physically, which is all Charlie was worried about at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what happened?\" He grabbed my shoulders, his eyes still anxious and wide. \"What happened to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must look worse than I\u0027d imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Dad. I . . . just had to talk to Jacob about . . . some things that were hard. I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anxiety calmed, and was replaced by disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was this really the best time?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not, Dad, but I didn\u0027t have any alternatives - it just got to the point where I had to choose. . . . Sometimes, there isn\u0027t any way to compromise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head slowly. \"How did he handle it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at my face for a minute, and then nodded. That must have been answer enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you didn\u0027t mess up his recovery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a quick healer,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the control slipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be in my room,\" I told him, shrugging out from underneath his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Kay,\" Charlie agreed. He could probably see the waterworks starting to escalate. Nothing scared Charlie worse than tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way to my room, blind and stumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, I fought with the clasp on my bracelet, trying to undo it with shaking fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Bella,\" Edward whispered, capturing my hands. \"It\u0027s part of who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me into the cradle of his arms as the sobs broke free again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis longest of days seemed to stretch on and on and on. I wondered if it would ever end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, though the night dragged relentlessly, it was not the worst night of my life. I took comfort from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was not alone. There was a great deal of comfort in that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s fear of emotional outbursts kept him from checking on me, though I was not quiet - he probably got no more sleep than I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hindsight seemed unbearably clear tonight. I could see every mistake I\u0027d made, every bit of harm I\u0027d done, the small things and the big things. Each pain I\u0027d caused Jacob, each wound I\u0027d given Edward, stacked up into neat piles that I could not ignore or deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I realized that I\u0027d been wrong all along about the magnets. It had not been Edward and Jacob that I\u0027d been trying to force together, it was the two parts of myself, Edward\u0027s Bella and Jacob\u0027s Bella. But they could not exist together, and I never should have tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d done so much damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point in the night, I remembered the promise I\u0027d made to myself early this morning - that I would never make Edward see me shed another tear for Jacob Black. The thought brought on a round of hysteria which frightened Edward more than the weeping. But it passed, too, when it had run its course. Edward said little; he just held me on the bed and let me ruin his shirt, staining it with salt water. It took longer than I thought it would for that smaller, broken part of me to cry herself out. It happened, though, and I was eventually exhausted enough to sleep. Unconsciousness did not bring full relief from the pain, just a numbing, dulling ease, like medicine. Made it more bearable. But it was still there; I was aware of it, even asleep, and that helped me to make the adjustments I needed to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning brought with it, if not a brighter outlook, as least a measure of control, some acceptance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, I knew that the new tear in my heart would always ache. That was just going to be a part of me now. Time would make it easier - that\u0027s what everyone always said. But I didn\u0027t care if time healed me or not, so long as Jacob could get better. Could be happy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke up, there was no disorientation. I opened my eyes - finally dry - and met his anxious gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said. My voice was hoarse. I cleared my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. He watched me, waiting for it to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m fine,\" I promised. \"That won\u0027t happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes tightened at my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry that you had to see that,\" I said. \"That wasn\u0027t fair to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hands on either side of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella . . . are you sure? Did you make the right choice? I\u0027ve never seen you in so much pain -\" His voice broke on the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had known worse pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched his lips. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. . . .\" His brow creased. \"If it hurts you so much, how can it possibly be the right thing for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, I know who I can\u0027t live without.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"You don\u0027t understand. You may be brave enough or strong enough to live without me, if that\u0027s what\u0027s best. But I could never be that self-sacrificing. I have to be with you. It\u0027s the only way I can live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still looked dubious. I should never have let him stay with me last night. But I had needed him so much. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hand me that book, will you?\" I asked, pointing over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows pulled together in confusion, but he gave it to me quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This again?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to find this one part I remembered . . . to see how she said it. . . .\" I flipped through the book, finding the page I wanted easily. The corner was dog-eared from the many times I\u0027d stopped here. \"Cathy\u0027s a monster, but there were a few things she got right,\" I muttered. I read the lines quietly, mostly to myself. \"\u0027If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and ifall else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.\u0027\" I nodded, again to myself. \"I know exactly what she means. And I know who I can\u0027t live without.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward took the book from my hands and flipped it across the room - it landed with a light thud on my desk. He wrapped his arms around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile lit his perfect face, though worry still lined his forehead. \"Heathcliff had his moments, too,\" he said. He didn\u0027t need the book to get it word perfect. He pulled me closer and whispered inmy ear, \"\u0027I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said quietly. \"That\u0027s my point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, I can\u0027t stand for you to be miserable. Maybe . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Edward. I\u0027ve made a real mess of things, and I\u0027m going to have to live with that. But I know what I want and what I need . . . and what I\u0027m going to do now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled just a bit at his correction, and then I sighed. \"We are going to go see Alice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was on the bottom porch step, too hyper to wait for us inside. She looked about to break into a celebration dance, so excited was she about the news she knew I was there to deliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Bella!\" she sang as we got out of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold it, Alice,\" I warned her, lifting a hand up to halt her glee. \"I\u0027ve got a few limitations for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know, I know. I only have until August thirteenth at the latest, you have veto power on the guest list, and if I go overboard on anything, you\u0027ll never speak to me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, okay. Well, yeah. You know the rules, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Bella, it will be perfect. Do you want to see your dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to take a few deep breaths. Whatever makes her happy, I said to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice\u0027s smile was smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Alice,\" I said, keeping the casual, unruffled tone in my voice. \"When did you get me a dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt probably wasn\u0027t much of a show. Edward squeezed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice led the way inside, heading for the stairs. \"These things take time, Bella,\" Alice explained. Her tone seemed . . . evasive. \"I mean, I wasn\u0027t sure things were going to turn out this way, but there was a distinct possibility. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" I asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perrine Bruyere has a waiting list, you know,\" she said, defensive now. \"Fabric masterpieces don\u0027t happen overnight. If I hadn\u0027t thought ahead, you\u0027d be wearing something off the rack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t look like I was going to get a straight answer. \"Per - who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not a major designer, Bella, so there\u0027s no need to throw a hissy fit. He\u0027s got promise, though, and he specializes in what I needed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not throwing a fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not.\" She eyed my calm face suspiciously. Then, as we walked into her room, she turned on Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You - out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" she groaned. \"You know the rules. He\u0027s not supposed to see the dress till the day of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another deep breath. \"It doesn\u0027t matter to me. And you know he\u0027s already seen it in your head. But if that\u0027s how you want it. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved Edward back out the door. He didn\u0027t even look at her - his eyes were on me, wary, afraid to leave me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, hoping my expression was tranquil enough to reassure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice shut the door in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right!\" she muttered. \"C\u0027mon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my wrist and towed me to her closet - which was bigger than my bedroom - and then dragged me to the back corner, where a long white garment bag had a rack all to itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unzipped the bag in one sweeping movement, and then slipped it carefully off the hanger. She took a step back, holding her hand out to the dress like she was a game show hostess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" she asked breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appraised it for a long moment, playing with her a bit. Her expression turned worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" I said, and I smiled, letting her relax. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my Anne of Green Gables vision all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s perfect, of course. Exactly right. You\u0027re a genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nineteen-eighteen?\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less,\" she said, nodding. \"Some of it is my design, the train, the veil. . . .\" She touched the white satin as she spoke. \"The lace is vintage. Do you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s beautiful. It\u0027s just right for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But is it just right for you?\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I think it is, Alice. I think it\u0027s just what I need. I know you\u0027ll do a great job with this . . . if you can keep yourself in check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe beamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I see your dress?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, her face blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you order your bridesmaid dress at the same time? I wouldn\u0027t want my maid of honor to wear something off the rack.\" I pretended to wince in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her arms around my waist. \"Thank you, Bella!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you not see that one coming?\" I teased, kissing her spiky hair. \"Some psychic you are!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice danced back, and her face was bright with fresh enthusiasm. \"I\u0027ve got so much to do! Go play with Edward. I have to get to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dashed out of the room, yelling, \"Esme!\" as she disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed at my own pace. Edward was waiting for me in the hallway, leaning against the wood-paneled wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was very, very nice of you,\" he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems happy,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my face; his eyes - too dark, it had been so long since he\u0027d left me - searched my expression minutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" he suddenly suggested. \"Let\u0027s go to our meadow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded very appealing. \"I guess I don\u0027t have to hide out anymore, do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The danger is behind us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet, thoughtful, as he ran. The wind blew on my face, warmer now that the storm had really passed. The clouds covered the sky, the way they usually did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meadow was a peaceful, happy place today. Patches of summer daisies interrupted the grass with splashes of white and yellow. I lay back, ignoring the slight dampness of the ground, and looked for pictures in the clouds. They were too even, too smooth. No pictures, just a soft, gray blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward lay next to me and held my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"August thirteenth?\" he asked casually after a few minutes of comfortable silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That gives me a month till my birthday. I didn\u0027t want to cut it too close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Esme is three years older than Carlisle - technically. Did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It hasn\u0027t made any difference to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice was serene, a counterpoint to his anxiety. \"My age is not really that important. Edward, I\u0027m ready. I\u0027ve chosen my life - now I want to start living it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked my hair. \"The guest list veto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care really, but I . . .\" I hesitated, not wanting to explain this one. Best to get it over with. \"I\u0027m not sure if Alice would feel the need to invite . . . a few werewolves. I don\u0027t know if . . . Jake would feel like . . . like he should come. Like that\u0027s the right thing to do, or that I\u0027d get my feelings hurt if he didn\u0027t. He shouldn\u0027t have to go through that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was quiet for a minute. I stared at the tips of the treetops, almost black against the light gray of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Edward grabbed me around the waist and pulled me onto his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me why you\u0027re doing this, Bella. Why did you decide, now, to give Alice free reign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI repeated for him the conversation I had with Charlie last night before I\u0027d gone to see Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t be fair to keep Charlie out of this,\" I concluded. \"And that means Ren��e and Phil. I might as well let Alice have her fun, too. Maybe itwill make the whole thing easier for Charlie if he gets his proper goodbye. Even if he thinks it\u0027s much too early, I wouldn\u0027t want to cheat him out of the chance to walk me down the aisle.\" I grimaced at the words, then took another deep breath. \"At least my mom and dad and my friends will know the best part of my choice, the most I\u0027m allowed to tell them. They\u0027ll know I chose you, and they\u0027ll know we\u0027re together. They\u0027ll know I\u0027m happy, wherever I am. I think that\u0027s the best I can do for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward held my face, searching it for a brief time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal\u0027s off,\" he said abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I gasped. \"You\u0027re backing out? No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not backing out, Bella. I\u0027ll still keep my side of the bargain. But you\u0027re off the hook. Whatever you want, no strings attached.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, I see what you\u0027re doing. You\u0027re trying to make everyone else happy. And I don\u0027t care about anyone else\u0027s feelings. I only need you to be happy. Don\u0027t worry about breaking the news to Alice. I\u0027ll take care of it. I promise she won\u0027t make you feel guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027re doing this your way. Because my way doesn\u0027t work. I call you stubborn, but look at what I\u0027ve done. I\u0027ve clung with such idiotic obstinacy to my idea of what\u0027s best for you, though it\u0027s only hurt you. Hurt you so deeply, time and time again. I don\u0027t trust myself anymore. You can have happiness your way. My way is always wrong. So.\" He shifted under me, squaring his shoulders. \"We\u0027re doing it your way, Bella. Tonight. Today. The sooner the better. I\u0027ll speak to Carlisle. I was thinking that maybe if we gave you enough morphine, it wouldn\u0027t be so bad. It\u0027s worth a try.\" He gritted his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, no -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his finger to my lips. \"Don\u0027t worry, Bella, love. I haven\u0027t forgotten the rest of your demands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were in my hair, his lips moving softly - but very seriously - against mine, before I realized what he was saying. What he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t much time to act. If I waited too long, I wouldn\u0027t be able to remember why I needed to stop him. Already, I couldn\u0027t breathe right. My hands were gripping his arms, pulling myself tighter to him, my mouth glued to his and answering every unspoken question his asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to clear my head, to find a way to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled gently, pressing me into the cool grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, never mind! my less noble side exulted. My head was full of the sweetness of his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no, I argued with myself. I shook my head, and his mouth moved to my neck, giving me a chance to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop, Edward. Wait.\" My voice was as weak as my will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he whispered into the hollow of my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI labored to put some resolve into my tone. \"I don\u0027t want to do this now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you?\" he asked, a smile in his voice. He moved his lips back to mine and made speaking impossible. Heat coursed through my veins, burning where my skin touched his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made myself focus. It took a great deal of effort just to force my hands to free themselves from his hair, to move them to his chest. But I did it. And then I shoved against him, trying to push him away. I could not succeed alone, but he responded as I knew he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back a few inches to look at me, and his eyes did nothing to help my resolve. They were black fire. They smoldered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked again, his voice low and rough. \"I love you. I want you. Right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butterflies in my stomach flooded my throat. He took advantage of my speechlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait,\" I tried to say around his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for me,\" he murmured in disagreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned, and pushed himself away from me, rolling onto his back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both lay there for a minute, trying to slow our breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me why not, Bella,\" he demanded. \"This had better not be about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in my world was about him. What a silly thing to expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, this is very important to me. I am going to do this right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s definition of right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled onto his elbow and stared at me, his expression disapproving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you going to do this right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. \"Responsibly. Everything in the right order. I will not leave Charlie and Ren��e without the best resolution I can give them. I won\u0027t deny Alice her fun, if I\u0027m having a wedding anyway. And I will tie myself to you in every human way, before I ask you to make me immortal. I\u0027m following all the rules, Edward. Your soul is far, far too important to me to take chances with. You\u0027re not going to budge me on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet I could,\" he murmured, his eyes burning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you wouldn\u0027t,\" I said, trying to keep my voice level. \"Not knowing that this is what I really need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t fight fair,\" he accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at him. \"Never said I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled back, wistful. \"If you change your mind . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be the first to know,\" I promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain started to drip through the clouds just then, a few scattered drops that made faint thuds as they struck the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glowered at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get you home.\" He brushed the tiny beads of water from my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rain\u0027s not the problem,\" I grumbled. \"It just means that it\u0027s time to go do something that will be very unpleasant and possibly even highly dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re bulletproof.\" I sighed. \"I\u0027m going to need that ring. It\u0027s time to tell Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed at the expression on my face. \"Highly dangerous,\" he agreed. He laughed again and then reached into the pocket of his jeans. \"But as least there\u0027s no need for a side trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe once again slid my ring into place on the third finger of my left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere it would stay - conceivably for the rest of eternity. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-28.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
