The blip indicating the ship had scarcely changed position on the overall screen but the coordinate pattern had been critically altered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter and Reid turned at the sound of a monitor signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, the face on the screen was agitated. \"Proteus off course. They\u0027ve picked up a blip in Quadrant 23, Level B.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid rushed to the window overlooking the mapping room. There was nothing to see at that distance, of course, except heads bent over the charts in quite obviously electric concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter reddened. \"Don\u0027t give me that quadrant stuff. Where are they?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the jugular vein, sir, heading for the superior vena cava.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a vein!\" For a moment, Carter\u0027s own veins were in alarming evidence. \"What in the world are they doing in a vein? Reid!\" he thundered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid hurried to him. \"Yes, I heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they get into a vein?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve ordered the men at the chart to try to locate an arterio-venous fistula. They\u0027re rare and not easy to find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what ..: \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Direct connection between a small artery and a small vein. The blood seeps over from the artery to the vein and ..:\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t they know it was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously not. And Carter ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may have been a pretty violent affair on their scale. They may not have survived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter turned to the bank of television screens. He punched the appropriate button. \"Any new messages from the Proteus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" came the quick answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, get in touch with them, man! Get something out of them! And put it through to me directly.\" There was an agonizing wait while Carter held his chest motionless for the space of three or four ordinary breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word came through. \"Proteus reporting, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God for so much,\" muttered Carter. \"State the message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve passed through an arterio-venous fistula, sir. They cannot return and they cannot go ahead. They ask leave to be brought out, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter brought both fists down upon the desk. \"No! By thunder, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid said, \"But general, they\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter looked up at the Time Recorder. It stood at 51. He said, through trembling lips. \"They have fifty-one minutes and they\u0027ll stay there fifty-one minutes. When that thing there reads zero, we take them out. Not a minute before, unless the mission is accomplished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s hopeless, darn it. God knows how weakened their ship is. We\u0027ll be killing five men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. That\u0027s the chance they take and that\u0027s the chance we take. But it will be firmly recorded that we never gave up as long as the smallest mathematical chance of success remained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid\u0027s eyes were cold and his very mustache bristled. \"General, you\u0027re thinking of your record. If they die, sir, I\u0027ll testify that you kept them in past reasonable hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take that chance, too,\" said Carter. \"Now you tell me-you\u0027re in charge of the medical division-why can\u0027t they move?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t go back through the fistula against the current. That\u0027s physically impossible no matter how many orders you give. The gradation of blood-pressure is not under Army control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t they find another route?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All routes from their present position to the clot lead through the heart. The turbulence of the heart-passage would smash them to kindling in an instant and we can\u0027t take that chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t, Carter. Not because of the lives of the men, though that\u0027s reason enough. If the ship is smashed, we\u0027ll never get all of it out and eventually its fragments will deminiaturize and kill Benes. If we get the men out now we can try operating on Benes from outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s hopeless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as hopeless as our present situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Carter considered. He said, quietly, \"Colonel Reid, tell me-without killing Benes, how long can we stop his heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid stared. \"Not for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. I\u0027m asking you for a specific figure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, in his comatose state, and under hypothermic chilling, but allowing for the shaky condition of his brain, I would say no more than sixty seconds. On the outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter said, \"The Proteus can plow through the heart in less than sixty seconds, can\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll have to try, then. When we\u0027ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however risky, however slim a hope, is what we\u0027re going to try. -What are the problems involved in stopping the heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. It can be done with a bare bodkin, to quote Hamlet. The trick will be to start it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, my dear colonel, is going to be your problem and your responsibility.\" He looked at the Time Recorder, which read 50. \"We\u0027re wasting time. Let\u0027s get on with it. Get your heart-men into action and I\u0027ll have the men on the Proteus instructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights were on within the Proteus. Michaels, Duval and Cora, looking disheveled, clustered about Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"And that\u0027s it. They\u0027re stopping Benes\u0027 heart by electric shock at the moment of our approach and they\u0027ll start it again when we emerge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start it again!\" exploded Michaels. \"Are they mad? Benes can\u0027t take that in his condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspect,\" said Grant, \"they consider it the only chance the mission has of succeeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the only chance, then we\u0027ve failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval said, \"I\u0027ve had experience with open-heart surgery, Michaels. It may be possible. The heart is tougher than we think. -Owens, how long will it take us to pass through the heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens looked down from the bubble. \"I\u0027ve been figuring out just that, Duval. If we have no delays, we can do it ill from fifty-five to fifty-seven seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval shrugged. \"We\u0027d have three seconds to spare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"Then we\u0027d better get on with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens said, \"We\u0027re drifting with the current toward the heart right now. I\u0027ll shift the engines into high. I need to test them, anyway. They took a bad beating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muted throb rose somewhat in pitch and the sensation of forward motion overlay the dull, erratic trembling of Brownian motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lights out,\" said Owens, \"and we\u0027d better relax while I baby this thing along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with lights out, all drifted to the window again-even Michaels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world about them had changed completely. It was still blood. It still contained all the bits and pieces, all the fragments and molecular aggregates, the platelets and red blood corpuscles, but the difference-the difference. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the superior vena cava now, the chief vein coming from the head and neck, its oxygen supply consumed and gone. The red blood corpuscles were drained of oxygen and now contained hemoglobin itself, not oxyhemoglobin, that bright red combination of hemoglobin and oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHemoglobin itself was a bluish-purple, and in the erratic reflection of the miniaturized light-waves from the ship, each corpuscle glittered in flashes of blue and green with a frequently interspersed purple. All else took on the tinge of these unoxygenated corpuscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platelets slid by in shadow and twice the ship passed -at a most grateful distance-the ponderous heavings of a white blood-cell, colored now in greenish-tinged cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant looked at Cora\u0027s profile once more, lifted, as it was, with almost worshipful reverence, and itself looking infinitely mysterious in shadowy blue. She was the ice-queen of some polar region lit by a blue-green aurora, Grant thought quixotically, and suddenly found himself empty and yearning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval murmured, \"Glorious!\" -But it was not at Cora that he was looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, \"Are you ready, Owens? I\u0027m going to guide you through the heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to his charts and put on a small overhead light that instantly dimmed the murky blue that had just filled the Proteus with mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owens,\" he called. \"Heart-chart A-2. Approach. Right atrium. You have it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said, \"Are we at the heart already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen for yourself,\" said Michaels, testily. Don\u0027t look. Listen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unbreathing silence fell upon those within the Proteus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could hear it-like the distant boom of artillery. It was only a rhythmic vibration of the floor of the ship, slow and measured, but growing louder. A dull thud, followed by a duller; a pause, then a repetition, louder, always louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heart!\" said Cora. \"It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" said Michaels, \"slowed a great deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we don\u0027t hear it accurately,\" said Duval, with dissatisfaction. The sound waves are too immense in themselves to affect our ear. They set up secondary vibrations in the ship but that\u0027s not the same thing. In a proper exploration of the body ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At some future time, doctor,\" said Michaels. \"It sounds like cannon,\" said Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but it lays down quite a barrage; two billion heartbeats in threescore years and ten,\" said Michaels. \"More.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And every beat,\" added Duval, \"is the thin barrier separating us from Eternity, each giving us time to make our peace with ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These particular beats,\" said Michaels, \"will send us straight to Eternity and give us no time at all. Shut up, all of you. Are you ready, Owens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. At least I\u0027m at the controls and I\u0027ve got the chart before me. But how do I find my way through this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t get lost, even if we try. We\u0027re in the superior vena cava now, at the point of junction with the inferior. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. In seconds, we\u0027ll be entering the right atrium, the first chamber of the heart-and they had better stop the heart, too. Grant, radio our position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant was momentarily lost to all else in his fascination with the view ahead. The vena cava was the largest vein in the body, receiving in the final stretch of its tube all the blood from all the body but the lungs. And as it gave way to the atrium, it became a vast resounding chamber, the walls of which were lost to sight so that the Proteus seemed to ho within a dark, measureless ocean. The heart was a slow, terrifying pound now, and at each steady thud, the ship seemed to lift and tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Michaels\u0027 second call, Grant snapped back to life and turned to his radio transmitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens called out, \"Tricuspid valve ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others looked ahead. At the end of a long, long corridor, they could see it in the far distance. Three sparkling red \u0027sheets, separating and billowing open as they moved away from the ship. An aperture yawned and grew larger while the cusps of the valve fluttered each to its respective side.. There beyond it was the right ventricle, one of the two main chambers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u0027 blood-stream moved into the cavity as though being pulled by a powerful suction. The Proteus moved with it so that the aperture approached and enlarged at a tremendous rate. The current was smooth, however, and the ship rode it with scarcely a tremor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came the sound of the thunderous boom of the ventricles, the main, muscular chambers of the heart, as they contracted in systole. The leaves of the tricuspid valve ballooned back toward the ship, moving slowly shut, with a wet, smacking contact that closed the wall ahead into a long vertical furrow that parted into two above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the right ventricle that lay on the other side of the now-closed valve. As that ventricle contracted, the blood could not regurgitate through the atrium and was forced instead into and through the pulmonary artery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant called out above the reverberating boom. \"One more heartbeat and that will be the last, they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, \"It had better be, or it\u0027s our last heartbeat, too. Shove on through, full speed, Owens, the instant the valve opens again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was firm determination in his face now, Grant noted absently-no fear at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radioactive sensors that had hovered about Benes\u0027 head and neck were now clustered over his chest, over a region from which the thermal blanket had been folded hack,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charts of the circulating system on the wall had expanded now in the region of the heart and showed only part of the heart-the right atrium. The blip that marked the position of the Proteus had moved smoothly down the -vena cava into the lightly muscled atrium which had expanded as they entered, then contracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship had, in one bound, been pushed nearly the length of the atrium toward the tricuspid valve, which closed just as they were at its brink. On an oscilloscopic scanner, each heartbeat was being translated into a wavering electronic beam and it was watched narrowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe electro-shock apparatus was in position; and the electrodes hovered over Benes\u0027 breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final heartbeat began. The electron beam on the oscilloscope began moving upward. The left ventricle was relaxing for another intake of blood and as it relaxed the tricuspid valve would open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" cried the technician at the heart indicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two electrodes came down upon the chest, a needle on one of the dials of the heart-console swung instantly into the red and a buzzer sounded urgently. It was flipped into silence. The oscilloscope record flattened out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message went up to the control-tower in all its final simplicity, \"Heartbeat stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter grimly clicked the stop-watch in his hands and the seconds began ticking off with unbearable speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive pairs of eyes looked forward at the tricuspid valve. Owens\u0027 hand was set for acceleration. The ventricle was relaxing and the semi-lunar valve at the end of the pulmonary artery, somewhere in there, must be creaking shut. No blood could return to the ventricle from the artery; the valve made sure of that. The sound of its closing filled the air with an unbearable vibration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as the ventricle continued to relax, blood had to enter from another direction-from the right atrium. The tricuspid valve, facing in the other direction, began to flutter open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mighty puckered crack ahead began to broaden, to make a corridor, a larger corridor, a vast opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" shouted Michaels. \"Now! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were lost in the heartbeat and in the rise of the engines. The Proteus shot forward, through the opening and into the ventricle. In a few seconds, that ventricle would contract and in the furious turbulence that would follow the ship would be crushed like a match-box and they would all he dead-and three quarters of an hour later Benes would be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant held his breath. The diastolic beat rumbled into silence and now-Nothing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deadly silence had fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval cried, \"Let me see!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was up the ladder and his head emerged into the bubble, the one spot within the ship from which a clear, unobstructed view to the rear was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heart has stopped,\" he cried. \"Come and see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora took his place, and then Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tricuspid valve hung half open and limp. On its inner surface were the tremendous connective fibers that bound it to the inner surface of the ventricle; fibers that pulled the valve-leaves back when the ventricle relaxed; and that held them firmly in position, when the contraction of the ventricle forced them together, preventing those leaves from pushing through altogether and making a reversed opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The architecture is marvelous,\" said Duval. \"It would be magnificent to see that valve close from this angle, held by living struts designed to do their work with a combination of delicacy and strength that man himself, for all his science, cannot yet duplicate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were to see that sight now, doctor, it would be your last,\" said Michaels. \"Top speed, Owens, and bear to the left, for the semi-lunar valve. We have thirty seconds to get out of this death-trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were a death-trap, and undoubtedly it was, it was a somberly beautiful one. The walls were strutted with mighty fibers, dividing into roots that were firmly fixed to the distant walls. It was as though they saw in the distance a gigantic forest of gnarled leaf-less trees writhing and riven into a complex design that strengthened and held firm the most vital muscle of the human body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat muscle, the heart, was a double pump that had to beat from well before birth to the final moment before death and do so with unbroken rhythm, unwearying strength, under all conditions. It was the greatest heart in the animal kingdom. The heart of no other mammal beat more than a billion times or so before even the most delayed approach of death, but after a billion heartbeats the human being was merely in early middle-age, in the prime of his strength and power. Men and women had lived long enough to experience well over three billion heartbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens\u0027 voice broke in. \"Only nineteen seconds to go, Dr. Michaels. I see no sign of the valve yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep on, darn it. You\u0027re headed there. And it had better be open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant said tensely, \"There it is. Isn\u0027t that it? That dark spot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels looked up from his chart to cast it the most cursory glance. \"Yes, it is. And its partly open, too, enough for us. The systolic heartbeat was at the point of starting when the heart was shut down. Now, everyone, strap yourselves in tightly. We\u0027re slamming through that opening, but the heartbeat will be right behind us and when it comes ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it comes,\" said Owens softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it comes,\" repeated Michaels, \"there\u0027ll be a terrific surge of blood. We\u0027ll have to stay as far ahead of it as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith determined desperation, Owens flashed the ship ahead for the tiny opening that marked the center of, the crescent crack (\"semi-lunar\" for that reason) that marked the closed valve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operating room labored under a tense silence. The surgical team, hovering over Benes, were as motionless as he. Benes\u0027 cold body and stopped heart brought the aura of death close above all in that room. Only the restlessly quivering sensors remained as signs of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the control-room, Reid said, \"They\u0027re obviously safe so far. They\u0027re through the tricuspid and are following a curved path aiming at the semi-lunar valve. That\u0027s deliberate, powered motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Carter, watching his stop-watch in tense agony. \"Twenty-four seconds left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re almost there now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen seconds left,\" said Carter inexorably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heart-technicians at the electro-shock apparatus moved stealthily into position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aiming straight into the semi-lunar valve.\" \"Six seconds left. Five. Four . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going through.\" And as he spoke, a warning buzzer, ominous as death, sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Revive heartbeat,\" came the word over one of the speakers, and a red button was pressed. A pace-maker went into action, and a rhythmic surge of potential made its appearance on an appropriate screen in the form of a pulsing swing of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oscilloscope registering heartbeat remained dead. The pace-maker pulse was increased, while eyes watched tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s got to start,\" said Carter, whose whole body tensed and pushed forward in muscular sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Proteus entered the aperture, which looked like a pair of barely open lips curved in a gigantically pendulous smile. It scraped against the tough membrane above and below, hung back a moment as the engine roar raised its pitch in a temporarily vain attempt to free the ship of the sticky embrace-then lunged through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re out of the ventricle,\" said Michaels, rubbing him forehead and then looking at his hand which had come away wet, \"and into the pulmonary artery. -Continue at full speed, Owens. The heartbeat should start in three seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens looked back. He alone could do so, the others being strapped helplessly in their seat with forward vision only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe semi-lunar valve was receding, still closed, with its fibers straining their points of attachments into suckers of tense tissue. With distance, the valve grew smaller, and was still closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens said, \"The heartbeat. isn\u0027t coming. It isn\u0027t . . . Wait, wait. There it is.\" The two leaves of the valve were relaxing; the fibrous supports were falling back and their tense roots puckered and became flabby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aperture was gaping, the rush of blood was coming, and overtaking them was the gigantic \"bar-room-m-m\" of the systole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tidal wave of blood caught up with the Proteux, hurtling it forward at break-neck velocity. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fantastic-voyage/page-10.html","bookId":1750,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:24 AM"}
