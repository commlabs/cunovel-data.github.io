{"id":23012,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV THE NEWS PREDICTS DEFEAT","content":"\u0026nbsp;Gerald sat on the lowest step in front of Oxford. It was Friday morning and a chilly, depressing gray fog was driving in from the Sound. Somewhere in the distance a whistle buoy was moaning and at intervals a steamer, creeping along off shore, bellowed hoarsely. It was twenty minutes before first recitation hour and Gerald had the entrance to himself. A copy of the morning’s Greenburg News was held in front of him, getting damper and limper every minute, and Gerald was perusing the football column. The News chronicled each day the progress of the Yardley and Broadwood teams, and as the game between the rival schools approached the News devoted more and more space to them. To-day the football specialist of the paper came out flat-footed with the prediction that Broadwood would win the contest. The News had of late years shown a strong partiality to Yardley and this prediction troubled Gerald the more for that reason. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [191]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It’s some time,” said the News, “since the Green has defeated the Blue and lots of people around here have begun to wonder whether she is ever going to repeat. Even the longest road has its turning, though, and the luck has to change some time. And it looks very much now as if the change would take place a week from to-morrow when Broadwood and Yardley meet in their fourteenth annual contest. In fact those who have seen both teams in action don’t hesitate to hand the victory to the Green right now. This may sound rash, but they have plenty of good argument to support their verdict with.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “On the season’s showing Broadwood is undoubtedly ahead. She has met teams equal to those Yardley has played and has survived every battle without a defeat, whereas Yardley fell an easy victim to Forest Hill last week. In total of points made, Broadwood leads her ancient rival by 88 to 67, not a wide margin certainly, but sufficient to prove Broadwood’s greater scoring power. Broadwood has been scored against twice for a total of 8, Yardley as many times for a total of 10. Taking the work of the two teams last Saturday as a basis of comparison, the Green is still in the lead. She piled up a score of 11 points against a worthy opponent and was scored on herself by a goal-from-field. In the last two[192] quarters Broadwood played solely on the defensive. Meanwhile Yardley had the utmost difficulty to keep from being shut out ignominiously by Forest Hill, a much weaker team than Nordham. Forest Hill found the Yardley defense easy, and, especially in the third period, did about as she wanted with it. She should have had at least one more touchdown on the showing made. Yardley secured her three points when play was almost over, the infallible Burtis toeing a very pretty field-goal from the forty-five yards. It will be interesting to see how Yardley performs against Nordham to-morrow, by the way, for there is a strong sentiment on the hill in favor of beating Nordham at any cost, in view of the defeat which the latter institution handed to the Blue last year.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But comparative scores don’t always tell the truth. Nor does a team’s showing up to the moment of her final game mean very much. Many a team has gone through an unfortunate season and then turned in and taken the measure of its rival in fine style. Yardley, therefore, may surprise us by showing a reversal of form to-morrow and piling up a bigger score against Nordham than did Broadwood, in which case those who are predicting a Broadwood victory a week from to-morrow would have cause for thought. But[193] there are other things to be considered besides the season’s showing of the two teams and their comparative scores. Broadwood looks better on the field and in action as well as on paper. She has a hard-playing, powerful team which will outweigh Yardley three or four pounds to the man at least. Her back-field will average five pounds heavier. And, unlike heavy teams of previous years, this season’s Broadwood aggregation is fast, fully as fast as Yardley’s. With a dry field and no favor Broadwood’s team should be worth at least one score more than Yardley’s.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In style of play the rivals are much alike. Both depend largely on line plays to gain ground, although Yardley, with Burtis in the line-up, will naturally do a good deal of kicking. That phenomenon, by the way, although practically a new man this season, has come at a fast clip, and those who consider him only as a brilliant punter and drop-kicker are in for a surprise. As a dodging back he has no equal on his own team and will suffer but little by comparison with Captain Raynor of Broadwood. The Green is ahead at present in the matter of team-play. She seems to have got together earlier in the season than usual, and both defense and offense are running smoothly. On the whole, the Green has a big,[194] powerful team this year, one at least twenty-five per cent. better than that which suffered defeat last year by the narrowest of margins. On the other hand, it can’t be said that Yardley is a whit better off than she was last November; rather, it is doubtful if she is as well off. She has had to build almost a whole new team, having suffered badly by graduation, and so far whatever there is in the team hasn’t shown to be dangerous. It may be that in the few practice days remaining before the big show Coach Payson, who is one of the cleverest men handling a school eleven to-day, will manage to work a miracle. If he doesn’t we can’t see but what there will be cause for rejoicing in the Broadwood camp at sunset of the 17th—a rejoicing likely to be worth seeing because so long delayed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gerald lowered the paper thoughtfully. “If you believe that,” he murmured, “we’re beaten this minute. I guess Broadwood is pretty good this year; everybody is saying so. I’d hate to have the school get beaten my last year, though.” He shook his head. “I wonder if Payson has anything up his sleeve. Kendall says he’s developing end run plays to beat the band. Maybe that’s the answer. Broadwood can’t be so terribly fast if she’s as heavy as this fellow says,[195] and perhaps Payson expects to work the ends and try field goals. Seems to me that would be his best plan. There’s no denying that our back-field is weak on line-plunging. They showed that Saturday.” He took up the paper again. “Let’s see what the games are to-morrow. Yale plays Brown. That’ll be a cinch. Harvard plays Cornell——”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What are you muttering about?” asked a voice. Gerald looked up to find Harry beside him. “What are you trying to do, Gerald? Get rheumatism and pneumonia and a few other things?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I’m doing this for my complexion,” replied Gerald with a grin. “They say fog is great for the complexion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Brr! I’d rather go without the complexion. Come on inside, unless you’re doing penance out here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Seen the News this morning?” asked Gerald, as he followed the other up the steps.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, anything in it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A column or so about the teams. We’re going to get licked. It says so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harry smiled untroubledly. “You’ll have to show me,” he said. “Why, what does the paper know about it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’d think it knew everything about it to[196] read it,” answered Gerald sadly. “Who is going to win, anyhow?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little old Yardley,” replied Harry unhesitatingly. “Cheer up! You’re full of fog. Isn’t this a peach of a day?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Fine!” They laid their books on a radiator near the entrance and backed up to the warmth. “What are your reasons for thinking so?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thinking what? Oh, about the game? Why, we always do win, don’t we? What’s to keep us from doing it again?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The luck has to change,” answered the other unconsciously quoting the News. “They say Broadwood has a dandy team this year.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course; she always has. But what of it? So have we.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The News says we haven’t.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harry seized the paper and dropped it behind the radiator. “If you wouldn’t read such stuff you wouldn’t be worried. They have to fill the paper up with something, and they might as well say one thing as another. How’s Kendall?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Blooming. Have you noticed anything about him the last three or four days?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, what? I haven’t seen very much of him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, he seems—different, somehow. Has more—more assurance. Why, I came across him[197] yesterday talking with Perry Whitehall, as thick as two thieves. And Wednesday he actually got into a discussion with Simms about something and threshed it right out with him and made Simms back down. Something about some formation in football. And he looks different, too.” Gerald frowned thoughtfully at the bust of Pallas across the corridor. “Looks as though he kind of thought more of himself.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well,” laughed Harry, “there’s no harm in that. But what about the campaign? Do we make progress?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We surely do; but a whole lot depends on what Kendall does in the next two games. If he will do a star act or two he can’t help getting the captaincy. I’ve been sort of sleuthing around, Harry. None of the fellows seem to have picked a candidate yet. There’s talk of Crandall, but it’s only talk. What I’m wondering is whether it wouldn’t be a good idea to casually suggest Kendall’s name to one or two of the football bunch; just offhand, you know.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose it would. Only the fellows mustn’t think we want him for captain. It ought to be done mighty carefully.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, and I guess it would be a good idea to wait until after to-morrow’s game and see what happens then. If Kendall kicks a couple of field[198] goals or distinguishes himself any other way perhaps we won’t have to say a word.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He won’t, though,” answered Harry. “Just because we want him to, he will get hurt at the beginning of the game and have to be laid off. You see if he doesn’t! That’s the way things happen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who’s full of fog now?” laughed Gerald. “You’re as pessimistic as an owl. And you’re all wrong, too. Something tells me that we are going to win to-morrow and that Kendall is going to make a blooming hero of himself. Still, if he doesn’t it will be up to us to start the ball rolling. We might each drop a hint, you know. Who do you know best on the team? Charlie Merriwell?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, Pete or Bert, I suppose.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, you go for Bert, then. You could just say something about it’s being pretty near time to think about a new captain, and wonder who he will be. Then you could say that you think Kendall would make a pretty good one. See?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ye-es. But, say, Gerald, have you thought how we’d feel if they did make Kendall captain and he didn’t turn out to be the right fellow, after all?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, because he will be the right fellow. What’s the use of considering things that aren’t[199] so? Dan picked Kendall for the place, and Dan knows.” The corridor was filling with students, and Gerald dropped his voice. “I had a letter from him the other day, and he particularly asked about Kendall. Come on, it’s nine o’clock.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harry groaned. “What do you suppose we have recitations for?” he asked. “Life would be so much nicer without them!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3280/89782.html","bookId":497,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:18:06 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:18:06 PM"}
