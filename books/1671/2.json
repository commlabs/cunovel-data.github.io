He checked the dial again. Its needle careened farther to the right, fully in the red, but fairly stable. The lever on the left would activate the printing apparatus upstairs. He pulled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed an answer, and he needed it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mighty computational engine strained and hummed, its gears and chains struggling against the request. At the rear a fuse fizzled and popped, but did not blow; a circuit objected with a fit of sparks, but held steady; a row of lights flickered, but did not go out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Gideon looked up at the basement door. He stared at it. Hard. And he willed the system to work the way he told it to—please, just this once, if never again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree seconds passed. He knew because he counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blue-green glow sparked to life on the machine as a thin line of watery light pooled through the crack where the bottom of the door met the top stair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Gideon breathed, but he did not smile. Turning on the apparatus was not the hard part. It was the first hard part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe printer was far too large to share the basement with its companion device, which occupied two-thirds of the downstairs floor space. Ordinarily this was a source of great irritation for Gideon, who would’ve been much happier to have everything in one room, or at least on one level, preferably at a quarter of the present size. But just this once, it was a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo long as everything worked. And sometimes, it didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines, wires, tubes, and lumpily soldered joints that connected the two machines were strung through holes in the ceiling and floor, carrying more information at a greater speed than any such wires were ever expected to bear. They twitched, sparked, and jerked as electricity surged from the master device, depositing Gideon’s answer into the printer’s circuits, where the information sorted and arranged itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the printing apparatus began to translate the electric and magnetic impulses from the mechanical brain in the basement onto paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nimble, spindly lead keys clacked slowly at first as rows upon rows of them rallied for the task, pressed themselves against ribbons of ink, and banged down on the paper receipt with sticky gravitas. Then the rhythm rose in volume, the noise soaring into something loud and rumbling, like the gravelly grunt of a diesel engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremendous roll of paper, bought from the Washington Star-News, unspooled within the printer’s belly. The apparatus dutifully pressed its message on the newsprint, and through a slot that emptied into a basket it spit out paper covered with whatever the brain downstairs commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed his grandfather’s coat off the back of a chair he never had time to sit in, and donned it with a fast hitch of his shoulders. He also seized a cast bronze plaque created as a gift by former president Abraham Lincoln—not for sentimental reasons or because the plaque was as valuable as the coat, but because it praised and identified Gideon’s greatest creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA series of heavy blows battered the door to the laboratory upstairs, but Gideon was finally smiling. He already had a plan—plans were never the problem. Time to execute them was more often the difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dashed up the stairs in a hurried tiptoe that muffled his steps, opening the basement door with care to keep it from squeaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever was trying to get inside through the reinforced main door had discovered his folly, or so the scientist assumed. That particular portal was lined with lead, and fastened to the wall with hinges made to hold a firehouse door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon checked the paper basket and said, “Excellent!” Before his eyes, the basket filled and then overflowed with a billowing flutter as the paper kept coming, covered with facts and figures of such outstanding volume that it surprised even the man who’d demanded them, knowing the answer would not be brief. And knowing it would not be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from the printer’s clatter, he heard only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intruders had given up on the door, but it wouldn’t take them long to come around the side and realize there was another way into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breaking glass of his office window was followed by the scrape of an arm, cleaning out the frame and pushing the shards to the floor. After this came the crush of feet on the scattered fragments, and the grinding sound of heels turning the glass to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon picked up an armful of paper and scanned it. His eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man called out, “This way! I see him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout lifting his attention from the printout, Gideon kicked the office door shut, then twisted the lock. It wouldn’t hold forever—not nearly as long as the main entrance. But he needed more time. The printing apparatus wasn’t finished. It spewed its contents without pause, flinging more and more and more still into the basket, faster than Gideon could empty it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy thump of a big man’s body shoved hard against the side door. Then three shots—something high-caliber, something that could punch holes in a body or blow away a lock. The fastener held through the fourth round. Gideon was not dealing with the world’s greatest sharpshooter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA booted foot kicked the door open with a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe printing apparatus wasn’t finished yet, but Gideon told himself that this much would suffice—it was enough to give him his answer, and, if he was very lucky, it might even be enough to make his case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stacks of numbers were so fresh they smeared ink across his palms as he hurriedly seized them and bundled them together. In the office doorway, a man with a red bandana over his face and a gun in his hand shouted, “Get away from that machine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritated at the interruption, Gideon tore off the printed paper and gave its dangling, still-growing edge a rueful look before hefting the bulk of the printout. He crushed it in his arms, holding it between himself and the gunman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the brief pause that followed, he let Lincoln’s plaque slip quietly from his grasp, hidden by the crinkled, fluffy mass of wadded paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the moment the plaque landed atop the printer’s console, Gideon flung himself behind a table and used his hip to knock it over. He dropped down for cover as the gunman opened fire. Two shots plunked into the heavy oak, which banged against the scientist’s elbows as he twisted, rolled, and folded the paper into a more manageable mass. Meanwhile, someone fired another shot, maybe more. It was hard to tell them apart over the rattling industrial clank of the printer’s keystrokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second set of footsteps joined the gunman, and two more bullets went wild. Maybe both of them were terrible shots. Something to keep in mind, but it didn’t mean he could disregard them. They only needed one lucky shot between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back there!” The first man pointed. The upended table rocked again as another volley dug a row of deep, splintering holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the incessant clatter of the still-pounding printer keys, he thought he could hear the intruders reloading. Even if it was his imagination, it was only a matter of time before they fired again. He needed a way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral plans presented themselves from his vantage point. He sorted and prioritized them according to likely cost versus success rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men stood between him and the stairwell door, but that was fine. He didn’t want to lead them down there anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Behind him. The trapdoor to a storage cellar. That’d be a better option. It had once been part of the basement, before the basement had been finished out for Gideon’s work. The old hospital was a rabbit warren of such places, and he knew them all, having studied the blueprints before establishing his professional headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the cellar’s exterior door may or may not have been barred from outside, closed up fast against storms or burglars. There was always the chance that choosing this escape route would render him a fish in a barrel, but he ran the odds in his head and was reassured. Despite the risk, this was his best chance, both for preserving his equipment and for escaping the facility unseen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon jammed the unwieldy bundle of paper under his arm and glanced about for something to tie it with. Nothing obvious presented itself, so he dropped that idea. He’d have to carry it unsecured. A little noisy, and a little inconvenient, but not impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this the Fiddlehead?” one of the men shouted to the other over the cacophony of pounding keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know! What does it look like?” came the uncertain reply, meaning they hadn’t yet seen the strategically relocated plaque.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind a counter over to his right, Gideon spied a jar of aluminum powder. His eyes narrowed, swiftly scanning the room until he remembered that the potassium chlorate was in the cabinet behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Science to the rescue,” he mumbled as he scooted on his knees and one hand—the other clasping the wadded sheaf of paper against his chest—across the floor and toward the aluminum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intruders must have heard him … maybe only a rustle of his old coat and the fast scrape of his boots as he scrambled out of the way, but they fired in that direction anyway, aiming wherever they guessed he might be heading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t hit too close. The noise from the printing apparatus disoriented them. Sometimes Gideon forgot how unsettling it could be to people who weren’t accustomed to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored it, fully and happily embracing the sound as cover as he knocked over a chemistry set on a repurposed tea tray. More confusion. More gunshots. But here was the aluminum. He’d have to stand for just a second to get the chlorate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the printout down by his leg. He’d need both hands for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and mentally checked the layout of the cabinet; he knew everything in it, every bottle on every row. Positioning himself as close to the right spot as possible, he counted back from three … two … one … and reached up to pop open the small door, hoping like hell that the morons with the guns wouldn’t shoot up the contents and blow them all to Maryland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nicked the bottom edge with a fingernail and the metal door flipped open. With a turn of his wrist, he seized the potassium chlorate without looking, simply trusting his memory. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fiddlehead-the-clockwork-century-5/page-2.html","bookId":1671,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM"}
