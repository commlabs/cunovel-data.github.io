Something solid. He decided it was probably not a toy, despite the childish wrapping paper and jauntily scribbled HAPPY BIRTHDAY in gold glitter across the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve Blackwell smiled at her son, her eyes dancing with anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open it and find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Max\u0027s eighth birthday. A striking child, with a predatory, aquiline nose, ink-black eyes to match his hair, and cheekbones most fashion models would have killed for, there was something both feminine and adult about him. Max had none of the fat-cheeked innocence of his friends. Max was knowing. He was lean. He was wild. If other little boys were puppies, Max Webster was a cougar in their midst, as dangerous as he was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than an hour ago, the Fifth Avenue penthouse Max shared with his parents had been crammed to bursting with fat-cheeked, eight-year-old puppies, all eager to ingratiate themselves with their famous classmate. The party had been Max\u0027s father\u0027s idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeith Webster said: \"The boy needs friends, Eve. He needs to socialize. It\u0027s not normal for a kid his age to spend every minute of his free time with his mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve did not object. She simply retired to her bedroom for the duration, locking the door. The party went ahead, and Max was inundated with presents: Transformers and Skalectrix and Hornby train sets and Action Men galore. Everybody ate a lot of cake and s\u0027mores and drank Coke till it came shooting out of their noses in frothy black torrents. Keith Webster took pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward Keith Webster asked his son: \"So, sport, d\u0027you have a good time?\" His face beamed with love and pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax nodded. Sure, Dad. It was great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax waited for Keith Webster to leave. Sunday night was Keith\u0027s regular softball game. He and some of the other surgeons from the hospital had gotten a team together to help relieve the stress of their life-and-death jobs. As soon as Max heard the click of the front door, he went in search of his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s just us now. I\u0027m sorry it took so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve unlocked her bedroom door. Dressed in a chocolate silk kimono-style robe that fell open at the front to reveal matching lace underwear, she pulled her son close. At eight, Max was still a fairly short child. The top of his dark, gypsy head reached just above Eve\u0027s navel. Pressing his cheek against her smooth, flat stomach, she felt him inhaling her scent, a mixture of Eve\u0027s own feral smell and the Chanel perfume she had worn since girlhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Max did was breathe. But Eve could feel the adoration in his small, compact body. A familiar rush of power made her flesh tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, sit down on Mommy\u0027s bed. You can have your special present now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax watched, delighted, as his mother retrieved the package from her glove drawer. This was what he\u0027d been waiting for. Not some asinine party with a bunch of kids from school who\u0027d only come over in the first place because they wanted to gawk at his mom. As if Max would ever let that happen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought again about Keith Webster. His father. How he loathed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, sport, d\u0027you have fun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFun? With you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax longed for the day when Keith Webster would be gone. Then he would have his beautiful mommy all to himself. Then he could finally stop pretending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith trembling hands, he tore at the wrapping paper. Inside he saw a glint of black metal. A train?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve\u0027s voice was husky, barely a whisper. Max gazed at her face. With the outside world, his mother always went to great lengths to hide herself. But not with him. Max was special. He got to see the real Eve Blackwell, scars and all. He loved her so much it sometimes made him weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom!\" He gasped. \"Is it...real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s real. And very old. It\u0027s been in my family for a long, long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLovingly, Max stroked the gun\u0027s trigger, his childish fingers caressing, exploring. Such power. And it was all his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve said: \"You\u0027re almost a grown man now, Max. You\u0027re too old for toys. Keith doesn\u0027t understand that, but I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve Blackwell always referred to her husband by his Christian name in front of their son, never as Dad or Daddy. In the early days, Keith had complained about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you\u0027d drop the whole first-name thing. It\u0027s creepy. Max doesn\u0027t call you Eve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Keith\u0027s sporadic efforts to introduce the d-word into his son\u0027s vocabulary always petered out after a few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve would insist: \"It\u0027s not me, darling, it\u0027s Max. Besides, I don\u0027t see that it\u0027s such a big deal. It\u0027s just one of his little quirks. The more you go on about it, the more he\u0027ll dig his heels in. You know what children are like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Keith know you\u0027ve given it to me?\" Max asked, still mesmerized by the gun. It was perfect. Like his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve smiled. \"No. It\u0027s our secret. I\u0027ll keep it in the safe for you so as not to arouse his suspicions. You may take it out whenever you wish. Just ask me and I\u0027ll get it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shocking thought suddenly occurred to Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t Uncle Peter\u0027s gun, is it? The one he...you know. When I was little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years earlier, Max\u0027s uncle, Dr. Peter Templeton, had almost shot his children in a drunken rage. No one was sure whether he\u0027d intended to kill himself, or Lexi, or Robert. Peter himself was too drunk to remember. All anyone knew was that the housekeeper had arrived at the Templeton brownstone early one morning to the sound of shots, that she\u0027d wrestled the gun from Uncle Peter\u0027s hands, and that in the process she\u0027d been shot in the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman had been paid off, of course. Max overheard Keith saying that the check was \"in the millions,\" but evidently the money had been well spent: the story never made its way into the press. From that day on, Max\u0027s uncle Peter had not touched a drop of liquor. The gun he used had mysteriously disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, darling. It\u0027s not Uncle Peter\u0027s gun. It\u0027s far more special than that. This gun once belonged to my grandfather, David Blackwell. Your great-grandfather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax\u0027s eight-year-old chest swelled with pride. He loved to hear his mother tell stories about her family. His family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax\u0027s earliest memories were of his mother\u0027s deep, sensuous voice lulling him to sleep with tales of his great-great-grandfather Jamie McGregor and the thrilling empire that he founded. Max\u0027s first word was mama, his second Kruger and his third Brent. While other boys dreamed about dinosaurs and Superman, Max\u0027s subconscious glittered with the stolen diamonds on which Jamie McGregor had built his fortune. My fortune. Max Webster had no need for fairy tales, of wronged princesses and dragons and gingerbread castles. His mother was the wronged princess. Eve had had her kingdom stolen from her and been imprisoned by his evil father in her penthouse tower. He, Max, was Eve\u0027s avenging knight. Kruger-Brent was their castle. As for the dragons to be slain, there were too many to count. Everyone Max knew was an enemy, from the despicable Keith, to the boys at school who made fun of his mother, to his Templeton cousins, Robert and Lexi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour cousins have stolen your inheritance, my darling. They have taken what\u0027s yours and cast you out like a serpent in the desert. Just as I was cast out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax\u0027s mother made their struggle sound mythical. And so it was. Eve had been cast out of the Garden of Eden. Max was the chosen one, the prophet, the messiah. It was Max who would restore the promised land to Eve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly by returning Kruger-Brent to his mother would Max win the greatest prize of all: her love. That was their covenant, sealed with the blood of his birth. Max thought about it constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil that day, the glorious day when he fulfilled his destiny, he must learn to survive on the scraps of love Eve tossed him. Usually his mother was cold and distant. Her constant physical presence in the apartment was like exquisite torture. Max longed for her embrace like a scorched riverbed longs for rain, but time after time he was denied. Keith Webster could touch her, with his sick, cold hands. But Max could not. On the rare occasions when his mother held him close, like today, the little boy felt he could move mountains. Pressed against her, lost in the intoxicating smell of her skin, joy coursed through his child\u0027s body like heroin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve stood up. Drawing her silk robe more tightly around her, she walked over to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax sat alone on the bed. As always, he felt his mother\u0027s leaving like a physical pain. He clasped the gun, her gift, pressing it lovingly to his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your great-grandfather David never used that pistol. Never fired a single shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve was looking out the window. She seemed to be speaking to herself rather than to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was too much of a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax took the bait, an innocent lamb gamboling to the slaughter. \"I\u0027m not a coward, Mommy. I\u0027m not afraid to use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so? And what will you use it for, my darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax didn\u0027t answer. He didn\u0027t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both knew what the gift was for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll use it to kill Keith Webster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll use it to kill my father. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mistress-of-the-game/page-6.html","bookId":2372,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:56 AM"}
