Almost instantly, Middle Peak filled with echoing rumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei had always been a very domineering figure in the sect. That was simply how she acted, and others had always accepted that since her father was Patriarch Limitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei had come to realize that years ago, and thus, always did everything in intentionally overbearing fashion. As she arrived, the rumbling in the lower finger of Middle Peak caused all of the Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors and elders to emerge from their immortal\u0027s caves. Shocked, they looked up to see Xuemei flying through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whistled along, just barely visible within the blood-colored light that surrounded her. Anyone who looked closely might be able to see her eyes beneath her blood-colored mask, flickering with cold arrogance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was instantly shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe Young Lady Xuemei has returned to Middle Peak!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Technically, she’s an elder of Middle Peak, but she doesn’t get along with Grand Elder Song Junwan, so she almost never appears here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eee? Where is she headed...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs people turned to look in the direction she was flying, they realized that there was a large accumulation of blood qi there. In fact, much of the blood qi on the mountain peak seemed to be slowly moving in that direction, causing a blood-colored light to illuminate the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the Foundation Establishment cultivators’ eyes flickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s where Young Lady Xuemei’s immortal\u0027s cave is. The blood qi....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could it be that Young Lady Xuemei has produced some valuable treasure?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had their own speculations as they flew up into the air and headed toward the immortal\u0027s cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Bai Xiaochun was in the middle of absorbing the blood qi from inside the immortal\u0027s cave. As he did, his Undying Live Forever Technique rapidly built up power. His fleshly body grew stronger, and although he looked the same physically, he was getting more powerful by the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The first level of the Undying Heavenly King, ten mammoths Berserk Ghost Body!” Bai Xiaochun excitedly focused on the sensation of his physical body getting explosively more powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight mammoths. Nine mammoths. Soon, he had reached the power level of ten mammoths!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s mind filled with rumbling sounds, and cracking sounds rose up that only he could hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, his flesh and blood exploded with tingling pain, almost as if freezing water were rushing through him. His body shook as the feeling spread out, filling him completely. He subconsciously took in another breath, and the tingling pain began to retract, slowly concentrating on one location in the pit of his stomach!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, it transformed into a boundless energy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat energy was formed from the intense trembling which wracked his entire body. At the same time, his flesh and blood became a vortex which madly sucked in all of the blood qi in the immortal\u0027s cave!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood qi raced toward him like stampeding horses; even the blood qi outside of the immortal\u0027s cave began to rumble toward him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was shaken, and even as he felt himself getting more and more powerful, a sensation of foreboding suddenly rose up in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, he had always controlled himself, and only absorbed a small amount of local blood qi. Moments ago, he had been attempting to absorb only the blood qi in the immortal\u0027s cave, which would have prevented any blood-colored light from rising into the air, thus making it very difficult for anyone to detect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, the ten mammoths Berserk Ghost Body of the Undying Heavenly King had formed, and he had lost control. His body became a vortex, sucking in all of the blood qi, and causing blood-colored light to shine up visibly into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to stop it from happening, but was too late. As his body transformed, blood qi poured into him, and rumbling sounds echoed out in his mind. His body continued to tremble harder and harder, and his strength rose explosively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, the power solidified. The strength of ten mammoths formed the Berserk Ghost Body!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s eyes opened wide, and the image of a berserk ghost appeared behind him. Although it was blurry, that was only because it was still in the process of taking shape. Within a few months, it would be incredibly clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of limitless power filled every inch of him, and yet, there was no time for him to revel in any excitement. He knew that the blood-colored light shining up into the air would surely attract attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Blood Stream Sect people are too domineering! You even have to walk on eggshells when simply practicing cultivation!” He was really starting to get nervous, and was well aware that plenty of people in the Blood Stream Sect hated him already. If they found him here, they would be murderously enraged, and the consequences were too horrible to even contemplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when he was about to flee, a beam of blood-colored light appeared, shooting down toward his location like lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, a young woman appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun. She wore a blood-colored gown and a mask of the same color, decorated with the image of a plum blossom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei looked into the immortal\u0027s cave with a blank expression. Never could she have imagined that someone in the Blood Stream Sect would dare to trifle with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mere idea of someone practicing cultivation right at the doorstep of her immortal\u0027s cave was completely outrageous, and she didn\u0027t know how to react. She couldn’t even think of anyone in the Lower Reaches of the cultivation world who would have the gall to do such a thing....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could sense that the blood bottle in her immortal\u0027s cave was already empty, and in fact, the blood qi had been drained from it so completely that the bottle was on the verge of shattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat bottle had been at work for more than ten years, but had been completely drained in a single night. Even as she stood there, trembling and panting, the last bit of blood qi left the immortal\u0027s cave and entered Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei’s phoenix-like eyes radiated murderous coldness as she turned to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young Lady Xuemei, what a coincidence....” Bai Xiaochun said, feeling a bit guilty. Seeing how furious she was, his first thought was to say that he was just passing by. However, all of the blood qi in the area was still rushing toward him because of his effort to reach the first level of the Undying Heavenly King, and there was nothing he could do to stop that. On the verge of tears, he could think of nothing else to do but change the topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is your immortal\u0027s cave? Why don\u0027t we talk things over, I can compensate you....” Before he could say anything else, numerous figures appeared, which were the Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors and elders of Middle Peak’s lower finger. It only took a moment for them to sense the lowered levels of blood qi in the area, and see the strands of blood qi streaming into Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they realized the implications of what they were seeing, they looked at Bai Xiaochun with murderous glares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was Nightcrypt! He\u0027s the reason why the blood qi has been in decline for the past few days....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the reason why I got hit by so many backlashes recently!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So this guy did it! Dammit, it was definitely him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs their murderous gazes fell onto Bai Xiaochun, he began to shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, hey there Brothers and Sisters. We\u0027re all on the same side here, how about I provide some compensation...?” Beads of sweat popped out on his forehead as he prepared to offer an explanation. Before he could, Xuemei lifted her chin, waved her sleeve, and pointed directly at Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill him,” she said, her voice as cold as ice. She only spoke two words, but from those words it was possible to tell how coldly arrogant she was. It was almost like she had just ordered the death of an ant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the surrounding Foundation Establishment cultivators heard her words, their killing intent spiked. Part of that was because of their trust in Xuemei’s ability to protect them, and part of it was because they had been driven mad because of the blood qi recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that they knew who was responsible, how could they not want to kill him? In fact, even if Bai Xiaochun wasn’t actually responsible, he had to be connected to the matter in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost as soon as the words left Xuemei’s mouth, the entire group attacked at the same time. In the blink of an eye, numerous divine abilities and magical techniques appeared. Countless streams of blood-colored sword qi all shot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing himself being attacked by a whole group of Foundation Establishment cultivators left Bai Xiaochun’s scalp tingling so hard it felt like it would explode. Even with the first level of the Undying Heavenly King, he could do nothing but flee in the face of such an attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You people are all bullies!” he shouted defiantly. “If you think you’re tough, why don’t you fight me one-on-one!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was already scared witless; clearly these people really were trying to kill him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Outrageous! It\u0027s just a bit of blood qi, isn’t it? I\u0027m a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Blood Stream Sect! I can’t believe you people are trying to kill me! Are you trying to force me out of the sect!?” Trembling and screaming, he sped away from the countless divine abilities and magical techniques. In his mind, Xuemei really was being too domineering; he\u0027d even offered compensation, but all she did was wave her sleeve and stick her chin up into the air. That was his trademark!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms filled the darkness of night as the entire lower finger of Middle Peak erupted into chaos. Numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators all flew after Bai Xiaochun, killing intent raging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Bai Xiaochun sped along as fast as a rabbit whose tail had been stepped on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re trying to kill me! Help....” Feeling completely maligned, he picked up speed as more and more people joined the chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only one who didn\u0027t was Xuemei. Gritting her teeth, she walked into her immortal\u0027s cave to examine the blood bottle. After a moment, she suppressed her killing intent and adjusted the spell formation to make sure that the bottle wouldn’t break because of the lack of blood qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the entire lower finger was in an uproar, and Bai Xiaochun’s screams rose up into the air, joined by shouts of rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can this guy run so fast!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going to cut him into a million pieces!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nightcrypt, I, Master God-Diviner, won’t stop until you’re dead!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite how the Foundation Establishment cultivators gave chase, Bai Xiaochun was too fast, and Middle Peak was too big. He raced back and forth for a full two hours, until he finally managed to shake all of the Foundation Establishment cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s hiding somewhere!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but he can\u0027t hide forever....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, I, Master God-Diviner, might be injured, but I can still take the risk to divine his location!” Gritting his teeth, Master God-Diviner snorted coldly and began the process of divining Bai Xiaochun’s location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment passed, his eyes turned even more bloodshot than before, and he suddenly pointed off into the distance. As he did, a blood-colored butterfly flew out of the tip of his finger, which the enraged crowd began to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Bai Xiaochun was hiding in a relatively remote immortal\u0027s cave, scowling and sighing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know that was Xuemei’s immortal\u0027s cave! I thought it was vacant, and just didn\u0027t want it to go to waste. I didn\u0027t do it on purpose.” He wanted to fight back, but considering how many people were angry at him, he knew he couldn’t. It was at that point that a blood-colored butterfly suddenly appeared in front of him. Without any hesitation, he burst off at top speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he did, the space where he had just been standing was blasted by countless magical techniques and divine abilities. If he had been even a bit slower, he would definitely have been injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous Foundation Establishment cultivators were in the area, and although some of them were of a mind to block his path, he was too quick, and sped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, another big chase ensued on Middle Peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, and the crowd had once again lost him. Master God-Diviner’s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and a blood-colored butterfly once again sought out Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nightcrypt won’t escape. How could he possibly evade my divination magic!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and over again, Bai Xiaochun came to find that no matter where he hid, the blood-colored butterfly would find him, and the enraged Foundation Establishment cultivators would be close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, he heard Master God-Diviner speaking, and realized that it was his auguries that were revealing his location. That left Bai Xiaochun grumbling in frustration, and yet, there was nothing he could do about it. Although imposter Nightcrypt had studied some divination magic before, he was a novice, and had no idea how to deal with Master God-Diviner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These people are all villains! The Spirit Stream Sect is way better. Even with lightning and acid raid, all they did was throw some rocks. But here, the tiniest things gets them all fighting and killing! What bullies!” Sighing, Bai Xiaochun thought about how much he missed the Spirit Stream Sect.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-199\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-201\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-200","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:08 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:08 AM"}
