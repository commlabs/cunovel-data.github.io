Presently he came to a brilliantly-lighted liquor saloon. As he paused in front of the door, a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder, and, looking up, he met the glance of a well-dressed gentleman, rather[60] portly, whose flushed face and uncertain gait indicated his condition.

As they were walking along Tom caught sight of his roommate, Milton Graham, just turning into a saloon, in company with two other young men. They were laughing loudly, and seemed in high spirits. Graham did not recognize Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope he won\u0027t come home drunk,\" thought our hero. \"It seems to me it is fashionable to drink here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tom\u0027s experience of city life was very[62] limited.

How long he slept he did not know, but suddenly awoke after an interval. Opening his eyes he became conscious that Graham had returned. He discovered something more. His roommate, partially undressed, and with his back turned to Tom, was engaged in searching our hero\u0027s pockets. This discovery set Tom broad awake at once. He was not frightened, but rather amused when he thought of Graham\u0027s disappointment. He did not think it best to speak, but counterfeited sleep.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wonder where the boy keeps his money,\" he heard Graham mutter. \"Perhaps it is in his coat pocket.
