Meet me in the common area later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe couldn’t stand here any longer anyway; we’d already started to get some looks. With a wave, I went to look for Twist, and found him running an errand for Whitewall, deep in the warrens. I fell into step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwist cut me a suspicious look. “What’s broken?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. As far as I know. I just wondered if I could do anything to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t you pull a shift early today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but I’m fine. And bored without work to do. You always seem to be busy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The place doesn’t run itself,” he snapped. And then he ran a tired hand through his hair. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t take it out on you. I’m trying to put together a naming day ceremony, and the Builders haven’t brought me their gifts yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When is it?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced; I could see why he was impatient and angry. “Why don’t I go talk to them for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you do that?” He stopped walking, canting his head to study me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answering, I could be honest. “Look, you do so much, and nobody seems to notice. Whitewall tells you what to do, but he seldom says ‘thanks.’ He just takes the credit when it goes well and blames you when it doesn’t. You’ve always been nice to me, even when I was a brat. I thought maybe I could help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwist smiled and patted me on the shoulder. “You’re a good one, Deuce. It would be great if you could round up the gifts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t mind at all. I know you have other things to do. Where should I have the presents taken?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same place you were named.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t been sure since that was the only ceremony I’d ever attended. A prickle of excitement went through me. This unknown brat was to become a Builder, which meant only they had to supply presents from which a suitable name might be drawn. But the rest of us would bear witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the warren, I made my way to the workshop. As ever, the noise nearly deafened me, a combination of clanging, banging, hammering that always had a good result, but I didn’t know how they all stood it. I saw Thimble at once, but we hadn’t talked since I came back. She might still be mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, she waved me over. “I want you to know I understand. It was wrong of me to mind that you put your orders first.” She paused in her work, surrounded by the various parts of some piece of furniture. “I had a chance to think about it, and Stone kind of yelled at me. I mean, if the senior craftsman told me I couldn’t tell you how to make the torches, I wouldn’t go up against him. No telling how miserable he could make my life in here, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “And I’d never ask you to spill Builder secrets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she hugged me, I didn’t realize how much I’d missed her. Thimble smelled of smoke and tallow. Though we’d outgrown brat-hood and had other responsibilities now, our friendship would endure. Just because some things changed, it didn’t mean everything had to. I wrapped my arm around her shoulders, feeling better already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides coming to see you?” That was a side benefit, actually, but it was better if she thought I’d come specifically to make up. “I’m also doing a favor for Twist.” I explained about the naming day presents. “Who should I talk to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be Rod’s territory. I think he’s working on it.” Thimble led me across the workshop, neatly sidestepping various projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped before a tall, gangly boy a few years older than us. He was scowling when we approached, which made Thimble slide me an apologetic look and disappear. That left me standing alone when he noticed me. His gaze flicked to my bare forearms and he barely contained a sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want, Huntress?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the slur he gave the title by using that subtle stress. “Twist sent me to collect the naming day gifts. I’m sure you have them ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a matter of fact, I do. Four boxes, right there. I can’t spare anyone to help you move them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned in the direction he indicated and stifled a groan. They were sizable, so it would take me a while, and I’d have to make four trips. Instead of arguing, as he clearly expected, I just nodded and strode over the far wall. It took both arms to lift the first one, and as I staggered toward the door, I collided with someone. I peered over the edge of my burden and recognized Banner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need a hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at Rod, who was already busy elsewhere, I said, “Sure. But I don’t want you to get in trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m off shift today. I came in to say hi to Thimble and see if she needed any help with the shelves she’s building, but I can take time for you first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This way, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed for the great room we used for all ceremonies, which took us through the heart of the warren itself. Going past the kitchen, I smelled something good, better than usual, or maybe I was just hungry. With Banner’s help, it only took two trips, but my arms were still burning when we finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That wasn’t so bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had to pick two words to describe her, they’d be “relentlessly cheerful.” I wondered what she’d say if she knew about the brat, or what the elders had done with the Burrowers. But I still didn’t have those answers, and I didn’t want to add weight to her shoulders. Better if Fade and I kept silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I finished your salve. Fade said to give it to him, but if you want, we can get it now.” Her blue gaze bored into mine, as if she were asking a silent question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shrug, I went with her to her space. I wondered why she didn’t store it in the workshop, but I didn’t think anything of it until we stepped inside her quarters. At first glance, it looked just like mine. And then she lifted her crate to reveal a depression in the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoarding. There was no doubt in my mind the elders would exile her if they got a look at what she’d hidden. Instinctively I took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fade said I could trust you. He said you’re one of us. Was he wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of who?” I whispered. I averted my eyes from her stash, willing her to put the crate back. I wasn’t sure I could lie to an elder—or even Twist—if confronted directly. The idea sent me into a cold, anxious sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our leadership is flawed. It doesn’t serve the people anymore, if it ever did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much, I agreed with, so I gave a cautious nod. The elders had lost my blind support, first through their treatment of the brat, and then Silk’s response to our report about Nassau disappointed me. College citizens would pay the price for their determination to permit no change. I understood the rules existed to protect us, but if we didn’t adapt to the new balance in the tunnels, we would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that being true, I still didn’t want to hear any of their plans. I was still a Huntress, not a traitor or a revolutionary. “Could you just give me the salve? Please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face fell in disappointment, but she did as I asked, and then I backed out of her space like she had a disease I could catch. I only wanted answers. I didn’t want to join some secret rebellion. Obedience was ingrained too deeply in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined to put some distance between Banner and myself, I hurried toward the kitchen. I had yet to eat my evening meal. I wanted to search for Twist to see if I could parlay the favor into information, but he’d get suspicious if I did it tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper ran from pot to pot, stirring and poking and slicing. I ate my meal standing up, much later than the other Hunters, and I had been right; it was good. She’d done something different with the fish and mushrooms, maybe augmented by something the Burrowers had sent. The place was full of brats, in fact, a testament to how long I’d waited. They all snickered to see me sharing their mealtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl grinned up at me. “Remember how you said on naming day you’d never eat with us again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. “Joke’s on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t feel like being social tonight so I went to my pallet and just lay down. Unfortunately, I wasn’t destined to be left alone. Before I’d been there long, my curtain rustled, indicating I had a visitor. Throat clearing followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a faint sigh, I climbed to my feet and stepped out. Fade. I’d forgotten I’d told him to meet me in the common area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you say to Banner?” he demanded. Rage pulled his mouth into a taut line, and he spoke through clenched teeth. “She’s been crying and she’s scared to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wouldn’t be this upset over nothing. Did you go to Whitewall? Or the Wordkeeper?” His hands fisted at his sides as if to keep him from reaching for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” I leaned in because I didn’t want to chance anyone overhearing. “Look, I’m not going to tell on her. I just … I don’t think it’s a good idea, that’s all.” Her willful hoarding was risky and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should I believe you? You ran to them on your naming day. You didn’t even sleep when we got back from Nassau because you were so scared of exile. Is that the way you want to live? Do you think it’s right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt that he didn’t trust me, more than I’d expect, especially after all we’d gone through together. I had saved his life, and he’d saved mine. We’d protected each other every step of the way. I would never do anything to hurt someone he cared about, even if his friend’s behavior was reckless and unwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rules exist to protect us.” But I didn’t speak the words with conviction anymore. I’d seen too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the anger drained out of his face. “She’s really upset. Would you mind coming with me to talk to her? I promise we won’t involve you in anything.” He shrugged. “I just thought, after everything, you might—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I can’t. But I’ll go with you to reassure her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we didn’t find Banner in her personal space. Nor was she in the kitchen, the common room, or the workshop. Thimble stared at me strangely when I popped my head in for the second time, but I just waved and went on. Fade’s scowl grew in proportion to the mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Builders never leave the enclave,” he said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Maybe she’s bathing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s find out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the only place we hadn’t looked. He walked with me, but he couldn’t go in. I slipped into the room, finding it darker and colder than usual. The steady plink plink of water added to the hiss of the torches. I found Banner in the corner. Fully dressed, she sat hunched over, paying no mind to the trickle dropping on her head. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/enclave-razorland-1/page-13.html","bookId":1652,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:49:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:49:51 PM"}
