When Jenny asked why, Audrey gave her a sideways glance under spiky dark lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing about video games-the farther you go, the harder they get,\" she said. \"N\u0027est-ce pas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairs had rubber padding with the ridges worn almost to nothing. Jenny couldn\u0027t see the top from where she stood-the roof of the Haunted Mansion hall was in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we waiting for?\" Dee said and vaulted onto the steps. Then she grabbed for the railing-as soon as her foot touched a step, the whole staircase had started moving with a jerk. It was a wheezing, groaning, shivering escalator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, geez,\" Michael said. \"I hate to tell you this, but when I was a kid I was scared of escalators. I was afraid they might catch the end of my muffler or something-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t wear mufflers,\" Audrey said and shoved him on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, if you\u0027re scared of escalators, then this one is probably your fault,\" Jenny said, stepping on behind him. \"Remember, he gets it all from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they neared the top, Jenny found they were riding directly toward a mirror. In fact, she discovered when she looked down the hall-after helping Mike jump off the escalator at the strategic moment -there were mirrors everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallway downstairs had been dark-this one was exactly the opposite. Light bounced and rainbowed off the mirrors lining the zigzagging walls until Jenny saw colored streaks even with her eyes closed. In fact, the mirrored walls zigged and zagged so sharply that it was impossible to get a clear view for more than a few feet. You had to veer alternately right and left to follow the hallway\u0027s path, and anything in the bend before you or behind you was invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, who put these here?\" Dee demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are my legs really that short? Or are these trick mirrors?\" Audrey asked, pivoting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael made one effort to straighten his wrinkled gray sweats and then gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s own reflection made her uncomfortable. She seemed to hear Julian\u0027s voice in her mind: \"Eyes as green as cypress and hair like liquid amber. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t what she saw. Just now Jenny saw a girl with flushed cheeks, whose hair was clinging to her forehead in little damp curls, whose tissue-linen blouse was beginning to go limp, and whose flowing cotton skirt was dusty and grass-stained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right or left-take your pick,\" she said, glancing up and down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Left,\" Dee said firmly, and they went that way, zigging and zagging with the acute turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mirrors were disconcerting. Everywhere Jenny looked her image was thrown back at her, and thrown from mirror to mirror so that she saw herself coming and going, reflected to infinity on all sides. Stay in this place long enough and you might forget which one is really you, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs in the other hallway, there were no deviations from the pattern, nothing to distinguish any part of it from any other. It was especially nerve-racking not being able to see more than one turn behind you, and not knowing what might be waiting around the next turn ahead. Images of the Creeper and the Lurker went through Jenny\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee, slow down,\" Jenny said as Dee\u0027s long, light step took her out of sight for the third time. Dee was navigating the corridor like a skier on a slalom, plunging in and out of the sharp turns, while the rest of them walked with hands outstretched to help them tell reflection from reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you guys hurry up-\" Dee\u0027s voice was responding from the next bend, and then there was a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to reflect from everywhere at once, but Jenny thought it came from ahead. She and Audrey and Michael stood frozen for a moment, then hurried forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee was standing, hands on her hips, in front of a door. It was mirrored like the walls, but Jenny figured it had to be a door because there was a red button like an elevator button beside it. When she looked hard she could distinguish the door\u0027s outline from the mirror around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the red button was a blue light bulb, round as a clown\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just appeared,\" Dee said and snapped her fingers. \"Like that. In that flash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the turn ahead they heard whimpering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer!\" Jenny, Dee, and Audrey exclaimed simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Summer, huddled in the next bend, her spun-sugar curls resting on her folded arms, her legs drawn beneath her china blue shirtdress. She looked up with a little hysterical cry at their approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it really you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Jenny said, kneeling. She was a little frightened by the expression in Summer\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, really you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Oh, Summer.\" Worriedly, Jenny put her arms around the smaller girl and felt her trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been alone here so long, and I kept seeing myself, and then sometimes I thought I saw other people, but when I ran toward them they weren\u0027t there___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who have you seen?\" Jenny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes Zachary-and sometimes him. He scares me, Jenny.\" Summer buried her small face in Jenny\u0027s vest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scares me, too, Jenny thought. She said, \"There\u0027s nothing to be frightened of now. We\u0027re really here. See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer managed a watery smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor sun Bunny, Michael said. I guess it must be your nightmare next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good job, Mr. Tactful,\" Dee said under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey explained about the nightmares to Summer. She wasn\u0027t as disturbed as Jenny thought she might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything to get out of here,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027ve only been here twenty minutes, and I hate the place already,\" Dee said. \"Anybody for claustrophobia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the door Jenny hesitated with her finger on the button. \"I don\u0027t suppose you want to tell us what you drew for your nightmare,\" she said. She didn\u0027t have much hope; none of the others had told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Summer said readily. \"It was a messy room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A messy room?\" Michael said. \"Oh, horror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really, Summer,\" Audrey said with a briskly adult air. \"It\u0027ll help if you tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee flashed an amused ebony glance at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did tell you. It\u0027s a messy room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, Summer,\" Jenny said gently. \"Well deal with it when we get there.\" She pushed the red button. The blue light went on. The door slid open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a messy room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Summer\u0027s bedroom, only more so. Ever since Jenny had known Summer, her room had been messy. Summer\u0027s parents were refugees from the sixties, and everything in their house was slightly frayed or weathered, but as Michael said, Summer herself had clutter down to a fine art. When you visited her you usually couldn\u0027t see the handmade tie-dyed curtains at the window or the bright patchwork quilt on the bed, because of the things hanging from them or piled up in front of them or scattered on top of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the room behind the mirrored door, Jenny couldn\u0027t even see the bed. There was a small clear space in front of the closet-everything else was obscured by piles of junk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee and Michael were giggling. \"Trust you, Sunshine, to have a nightmare like this,\" Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny sighed, not nearly as amused. \"All right, everybody, let\u0027s go in. I suppose we have to clean it up-there must be a door somewhere along one of the far walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, wait. I don\u0027t do the C-word,\" Michael protested, alarmed. \"Besides, dust is bad for my allergies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In,\" said Audrey, taking him by the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all squeezed in between the closet and the piles. The door slid noiselessly shut behind them-and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk about claustrophobia,\" Michael gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cette chambre est une vrai pagaille,\" Audrey said under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jenny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said this is one messy room. Summer, how can you stand it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer\u0027s delft-blue eyes filled with tears. \"My real room isn\u0027t as bad as this. This is my nightmare, dummy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why this kind of nightmare?\" Audrey said, not softening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because my mom never yells about my room, but once my nana came to visit, and she almost passed out. I still dream about what she said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make her feel bad,\" Jenny whispered to Audrey. \"Try to clear a path around the edges,\" she said aloud, \"and check every wall for the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe piles of junk were amazingly varied. There were heaps of rumpled clothes, year-old magazines, disjointed Ray-Bans, spindled cassette tapes, unstrung string bikinis, crushed frozen yogurt cups, bent photographs, mismatched sandals, dry felt-tip pens, chewed pencils, twisted headphones, musty towels, endless mounds of underwear, and a zoo of bedraggled stuffed animals. Also a dog-chewed Frisbee, a mashed Twister mat, and a futon that smelled like somebody\u0027s bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s spider city here,\" Dee said, gathering up one of the heaps. \"Haven\u0027t you ever heard of Raid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe in live and let live,\" Summer said vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really was a nightmare of sorts, Jenny thought-a nightmare of tedium. But Dee worked with tireless energy and Audrey with fastidious precision, and slowly they forged a path through the debris. Michael was no good at all-he stopped to leaf through every magazine he picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were getting to a different type of garbage-a type that made Audrey wrinkle up her nose. Blackened avocado husks, mildewed newspapers, and plastic glasses with the dregs of unidentifiable liquids in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jenny lifted a box of odds and ends and saw something like a pressed flower on the hardwood floor underneath. But it wasn\u0027t a flower, it was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong shape. At first she didn\u0027t recognize it, then she saw the little muzzle and the tiny curled-up feet. It was a flat and desiccated mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t help gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t touch that, I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee scraped it up with a 1991 calendar and threw it in the closet. Jenny felt a whisper of terror inside her, unease that went beyond disgust at the mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garbage got worse and worse-like what you\u0027d find at a dump, nothing that would be in anybody\u0027s bedroom. Food in all stages of decomposition. Every kind of refuse, trash, and litter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was smiling anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee picked up a tattered Easter basket, paused. An awful smell wafted from it. She stirred the cellophane grass with one long finger, and then her face convulsed. In the basket was a solid mass of white, writhing maggots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God!\" In one fluid motion Dee threw the basket at the closet, where it hit the door and scattered a shower of white. Michael bolted up from his magazine with a yell. Audrey and Summer were shrieking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny felt the quick, cold touch of real fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer-just what did your grandmother say about your room?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-she said things were growing in it,\" Summer reported, her eyes large and worried. \"She said it would attract bugs. She said it looked like an earthquake hit it. She said someday I would get lost in it and never come out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee, who had been staring at Summer, now cut a glance of startled revelation at Jenny. The tension in the room was palpable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ana just what kind of nightmares do you have about it?\" Jenny asked, trying to discipline her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Summer shivered. \"Well-it\u0027s like I hear a scratchy noise, and then I look and it\u0027s these cockroaches-but they\u0027re big, big as ... as sneakers. And then I see this thing on the floor. It\u0027s like fungus, sort of a column of fungus, but it\u0027s got a kind of mouth on the top and it\u0027s howling. It\u0027s howling fungus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer\u0027s lips were trembling by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may not sound scary, but it was. It was the scariest thing I\u0027ve ever seen in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA primitive warning was going off in Jenny\u0027s brain. She, Audrey, Dee, and Michael all looked at one another. \"It sounds plenty scary to me,\" she said. \"I think maybe we\u0027d better get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s lips were puckered in a soundless whistle. \"I think maybe you\u0027re right,\" he muttered. He bent to work without another word of complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closet was full by now, and they were just transferring things from before them to behind them, like digging a tunnel. The garbage kept getting grosser and grosser and scarier and scarier. Things Jenny didn\u0027t want to touch with her hands. She wore crumpled Tshirts like oven mitts to move them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the bugs came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started with a rustle, a pleasant sound like a taffeta prom dress. Jenny stiffened, then turned slowly to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cockroach, flat and brown. But it was huge, far larger than Jenny\u0027s foot. It crawled languidly out of the floor vent, squirming through somehow, its barbed back legs catching on the metal louvers. Its feet made soft ticking sounds on the paper debris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer gave a reedy shriek and pointed at it. Then another one came out of the vent, and another. Summer\u0027s pointing finger became a shaky blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny reached for a water glass to revive her and snatched her hand back. The glass was jam-packed with crickets, antennae twitching delicately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer saw it. She stopped pointing and went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmaller roaches emerged from a discarded candy box, the frilly paper cups crinkling as the bugs crept out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer\u0027s face was so white there were blue patches under her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIridescent green beetles the size of footballs began to climb the walls. They flexed their chitinous outer wings, their membranous inner wings hanging out like dragging petticoats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer stood like a statue of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked up. A dozen brown moths as big as small kites were clinging flat to the ceiling, their dark-spotted wings outstretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Summer, help us!\" Audrey said in a fear-clotted voice as she raked at the trash. Disturbed ants swarmed out of it, forming thick trails like black waterfalls over the debris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer didn\u0027t move. She was staring at one of the hard-shelled beetles like a witless rabbit caught in a headlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground rocked beneath Jenny\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she thought it was some effect of the garbage shifting. Then she remembered: \"She said it looked like an earthquake hit it....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to hurry!\" she shouted at the same time as Dee yelled, \"Go, go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were clawing through the garbage now, tearing just enough away from the wall to reveal cracked and peeling wallpaper, to make sure there was no door. They climbed on the smaller mounds, wading through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground shook again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whisper of terror inside Jenny had become a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry,\" she gasped, clearing refuse with sweeps of her arms. \"Hurry, hurry ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe towering piles of rubbish quaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all working frenetically, even Michael. Only Summer stood rooted in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The door!\" Dee shouted, from the top of a pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s head snapped up. Relief flooded through her. Barely visible above a stinking pile she could see the rectangular molding of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It opens in,\" Audrey said. \"We have to get all this stuff out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey scrambled over each other, ripping at the pile. A cockroach climbed onto Jenny\u0027s foot; she kicked it off. Time to scream later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room shook again. Jenny looked up and her breath hissed in. There were ominous cracks in the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Dee and Michael cleared the last rubble from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thankful sob Jenny helped them pull it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned to look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she saw wasn\u0027t anybody\u0027s room. It was Hell. There were huge cracks in the floor with monstrous, mutant bugs crawling out. The ceiling was buckling and plaster was filtering down. The moths, disturbed, were fluttering through the air, their wings making a sound like huge cards shuffling. And sprouting like grotesque anemones among the refuse were objects Jenny didn\u0027t recognize. They looked like drooping sea cucumbers and they were green-gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey and Michael had stumbled out into the hall of mirrors. Dee was holding the door. The earth rumbled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer, come on!\" Jenny shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer turned toward her voice, her large blue eyes blind. She took a step toward Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the growths directly in her path straightened up. It became a column. At the top of the column there was an aperture that flared open and shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aperture opened wide. A demented, obscene sound came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was howling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other growths were straightening. The moaning siren sound doubled, tripled. They were between Summer and the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer turned and stumbled back toward the closet, shrieking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer, no! Come back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground heaved. The piles of garbage were toppling, falling into the clear path. The mutant bugs skittered around in a frenzy. They seemed to be heading toward Summer. The fungus howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer\u0027s shrieks gave way to full-throated screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer!\" Adrenaline kicked in and Jenny plunged into the garbage, trying to climb it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny, come back!\" Dee shouted. More rubbish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efell. Jenny couldn\u0027t see Summer at all. The screams were fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny, I can\u0027t hold the door!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams fell silent. Only the howling went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earth jerked violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming down!\" Dee shouted, and Jenny felt a hand grab her, pull her backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-we have to get Summer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t get anybody! Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-Summer!\" Jenny screamed, turning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee ducked and caught Jenny around the waist. Jenny found herself flying over Dee\u0027s shoulders, out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael and Audrey grabbed her. Through the open door Jenny saw the ceiling come down. Dee staggered out and fell beside them. Jenny didn\u0027t have the strength to stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the door slammed shut as the toppling piles fell against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Michael said in a thick voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did a slow fade, like a still frame in a movie. It was a door, it was a slightly misty door, it was a transparent door with mirror showing through, it was a mirrored wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was staring wildly at her own image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see the others in the mirror. Audrey was white as china. Dee\u0027s face was gray. Michael looked numb. They huddled on the carpet, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had happened with such terrible suddenness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny whispered, \"When Dee was late coming out of Audrey\u0027s nightmare, the door didn\u0027t disappear. It stayed there-and she came out. But this time ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" said Dee in a very low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. Audrey, finally, was the one to say the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny put her face in her hands. It was a gesture she would never have thought she\u0027d use. At the moment it just happened. She wanted to hide from the world. She wanted to make everything that had happened unhappen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not fair,\" she whispered. \"She never hurt anybody.\" Then she was standing, shouting to the echoing hallway. \"It\u0027s not fair. It\u0027s not fair, damn you! She didn\u0027t deserve it! It\u0027s not fair!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny. Jenny, calm down-come on, now. Jenny, please-just sit down, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all trying to hold her. Jenny realized she wasn\u0027t in control of herself. She was trembling violently, and her throat hurt from screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs suddenly as it had come, the hysterical energy faded. Jenny felt herself falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey set her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" Dee said, and Jenny felt a hand stroking her hair. At any other time it would have surprised her. Now she felt nothing. \"It\u0027s okay to be upset,\" Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t understand. It was Jenny\u0027s fault. She was the one who had gotten them into this. If she had kissed Julian in the Erlking\u0027s cavern, she could have gotten Summer out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to mock her, an unseen clock struck two. But Jenny could only sit. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-10.html","bookId":2100,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM"}
