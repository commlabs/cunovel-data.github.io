Granny looked blank. “On the Circle Sea,” Hilta added. Granny\u0027s look of polite enquiry persisted. “Five hundred miles away,” said Hilta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” said Granny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up and brushed an imaginary speck of dust off her dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027d better be going, then,” she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilta laughed. Esk quite liked the sound. Granny never laughed, she merely let the corners of her mouth turn up, but Hilta laughed like someone who had thought hard about Life and had seen the joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start tomorrow, anyway,” she said. “I\u0027ve got room at home, you can stay with me, and tomorrow you\u0027ll have the light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We wouldn\u0027t want to presume,” said Granny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense. Why not have a look around while I pack up the stall?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOhulan was the market town for a wide sprawling countryside and the market day didn\u0027t end at sunset. Instead, torches flared at every booth and stall and light blared forth from the open doorways of the inns. Even the temples put out coloured lamps to attract nocturnal worshippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilta moved through the crowd like a slim snake through dry grass, her entire stall and stock reduced to a surprisingly small bundle on her back, and her jewellery rattling like a sackful of flamenco dancers. Granny stumped along behind her, her feet aching from the unaccustomed prodding of the cobbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Esk got lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took some effort, but she managed it. It involved ducking between two stalls and then scurrying down a side alley. Granny had warned her at length about the unspeakable things that lurked in cities, which showed that the old woman was lacking in a complete understanding of headology, since Esk was- now determined to see one or two of them for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, since Ohulan was quite barbaric and uncivilised the only things that went on after dark to any degree were a little thievery, some amateurish trading in the courts of lust, and drinking until you fell over or started singing or both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the standard poetic instructions one should move through a fair like the white swan at evening moves o\u0027er the bay, but because of certain practical difficulties Esk settled for moving through the crowds like a small dodgem car, bumping from body to body with the tip of the staff waving a yard above her head. It caused some heads to turn, and not only because it had hit them; wizards occasionally passed through the town and it was the first time anyone had seen one four feet tall with long hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone watching closely would have noticed strange things happening as she passed by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was, for example, the man with three upturned cups who was inviting a small crowd to explore with him the exciting world of chance and probability as it related to the position of a small dried pea. He was vaguely aware of a small figure watching him solemnly for a few moments, and then a sackful of peas cascaded out of every cup he picked up. Within seconds he was knee-deep in legumes. He was a lot deeper in trouble he suddenly owed everyone a lot of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small and wretched monkey that for years had shuffled vaguely at the end of a chain while its owner played something dreadful on a pipe-organ. It suddenly turned, narrowed its little red eyes, bit its keeper sharply in the leg, snapped its chain and had it away over the rooftops with the night\u0027s takings in a tin cup. History is silent about what they were spent on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boxful of marzipan ducks on a nearby stall came to life and whirred past the stallholder to land, quacking happily, in the river (where, by dawn, they had all melted: that\u0027s natural selection for your.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stall itself sidled off down an alley and was never seen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk, in fact, moved through the fair more like an arsonist moves through a hayfield or a neutron bounces through a reactor, poets notwithstanding, and the hypothetical watcher could have detected her random passage by tracing the outbreaks of hysteria and violence. But, like all good catalysts, she wasn\u0027t actually involved in the processes she initiated, and by the time all the non-hypothetical potential watchers took their eyes off them she had been buffeted somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was also beginning to tire. While Granny Weatherwax approved of night on general principles, she certainly didn\u0027t hold with promiscuous candlelight - if she had any reading to do after dark she generally persuaded the owl to come and sit on the back of her chair, and read through its eyes. So Esk expected to go to bed around sunset, and that was long past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a doorway ahead of her that looked friendly. Cheerful sounds were sliding out on the yellow light, and pooling on the cobbles. With the staff still radiating random magic like a demon lighthouse she headed for it, weary but determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord of The Fiddler\u0027s Riddle considered himself to be a man of the world, and this was right, because he was too stupid to be really cruel, and too lazy to be really mean and although his body had been around quite a lot his mind had never gone further than the inside of his own head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t used to being addressed by sticks. Especially when they spoke in a small piping voice, and asked for goat\u0027s milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautiously, aware that everyone in the inn was looking at him and grinning, he pulled himself across the bar top until he could see down. Esk stared up at him. Look \u0027em right in the eye, Granny had always said: focus your power on \u0027em, stare \u0027em out, no one can outstare a witch, \u0027cept a goat, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord, whose name was Skiller, found himself looking directly down at a small child who seemed to be squinting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Milk,” said the child, still focussing furiously. “You get it out of goats. You know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkiller sold only beer, which his customers claimed he got out of cats. No self-respecting goat would have endured the smell in the Fiddler\u0027s Riddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven\u0027t got any,” he said. He looked hard at the staff and his eyebrows met conspiratorially over his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could have a look,” said Esk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkiller eased himself back across the bar, partly to avoid the gaze, which was causing his eyes to water in sympathy, and partly because a horrible suspicion was congealing in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven second-rate barmen tend to resonate with the beer they serve, and the vibrations coming from the big barrels behind him no longer had the twang of hop and head. They were broadcasting an altogether more lactic note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned a tap experimentally, and watched a thin stream of milk curdle in the drip bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff still poked up over the edge of the counter, like a periscope. He could swear that it was staring at him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t waste it,” said a voice. “You\u0027ll be grateful for it one day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same tone of voice Granny used when Esk was less than enthusiastic about a plateful of nourishing sallet greens, boiled yellow until the last few vitamins gave in, but to Skiller\u0027s hypersensitive ears it wasn\u0027t an injunction but a prediction. He shivered. He didn\u0027t know where he would have to be to make him grateful for a drink of ancient beer and curdled milk. He\u0027d rather be dead first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he would be dead first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe very carefully wiped a nearly clean mug with his thumb and filled it from the tap. He was aware that a large number of his guests were quietly leaving. No one liked magic, especially n the hands of a woman. You never could tell what they might take it into their heads to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your milk,” he said, adding, “Miss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve got some money,” Esk said. Granny had always told her: always be ready to pay and you won\u0027t have to, people always like you to feel good about them, it\u0027s all headology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, wouldn\u0027t dream of it,” said Skiller hastily. He leaned over the bar. “If you could see, er, your way clear to turning the rest back, though? Not much call for milk in these parts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sidled along a little way. Esk had leaned the staff against the bar while she drank her milk, and it was making him uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk looked at him over a moustache of cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn\u0027t turn it into milk, I just knew it would be milk because I wanted milk,” she said. “What did you think it was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er. Beer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk thought about this. She vaguely remembered trying beer once, and it had tasted sort of second-hand. But she could recall something which everyone in Bad Ass reckoned was much better than beer. It was one of Granny\u0027s most guarded recipes. It was good for you, because there was only fruit in it, plus lots of freezing and boiling and careful testing of little drops with a lighted flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny would put a very small spoonful in her milk if it was a really cold night. It had to be a wooden spoon, on account of what it did to metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe concentrated. She could picture the taste in her mind, and with the little skills that she was beginning to accept but couldn\u0027t understand she found she could take the taste apart into little coloured shapes ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkiller\u0027s thin wife came out of their back room to see why it had all gone so quiet, and he waved her into shocked silence as Esk stood swaying very slightly with her eyes closed and her lips moving .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . little shapes that you didn\u0027t need went back into the great pool of shapes, and then you found the extra ones you needed and put them together, and then there was a sort of hook thing which meant that they would turn anything suitable into something just like them, and then ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkiller turned very carefully and regarded the barrel behind him. The smell of the room had changed, he could feel the pure gold sweating gently out of that ancient woodwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some care he took a small glass from his store under the counter and let a few splashes of the dark golden liquid escape from the tap. He looked at it thoughtfully in the lamplight,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned the glass around methodically, sniffed it a few times, and tossed its contents back in one swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face remained unchanged, although his eyes went moist and his throat wobbled somewhat. His wife and Esk watched him as a thin beading of sweat broke out on his forehead. Ten seconds passed, and he was obviously out to break some heroic record. There may have been steam curling out of his ears, but that could have been a rumour. His fingers drummed a strange tattoo on the bartop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last he swallowed, appeared to reach a decision, turned solemnly to Esk, and said, “Hwarl,ish finish saaarghs ishghs oorgsh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow wrinkled as he ran the sentence past his mind again and made a second attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aargh argh shaah gok?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bharrgsh nargh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife snorted and took the glass out of his unprotesting hand. She sniffed it. She looked at the barrels, all ten of them. She met his unsteady eye. In a private paradise for two they soundlessly calculated the selling price of six hundred gallons of triple-distilled white mountain peach brandy and ran out of numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs Skiller was quicker on the uptake than her husband. She bent down and smiled at Esk, who was too tired to squint back. It wasn\u0027t a particularly good smile, because Mrs Skiller didn\u0027t get much practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you get here, little girl?” she said, in a voice that suggested gingerbread cottages and the slamming of big stove doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got lost from Granny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And where\u0027s Granny now, dear? ” Clang went the oven doors again; it was going to be a tough night for all wanderers in metaphorical forests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just somewhere, I expect.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/equal-rites-discworld-3/page-12.html","bookId":1622,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:35 PM"}
