Who would care if there was fresh talk going around about an old tragedy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone who thinks that I really did murder Kaitlin might care. A lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze. “Dell Sadler. But why would he try to harm my dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As far as Dell is concerned, you covered for me that night. You’re involved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think he would have tried to harm Winston as a way of taking some revenge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think,” Rafe said deliberately, “that we’d better talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faded sign over the gate read SADLER’S AUTO RE- BUILD. Beneath it, in slightly smaller letters, were the words 24-HOUR TOWING. And below that was the phrase SPECIALIZING IN INSURANCE WORK. But the chain-link fence that enclosed the metal carcasses of ruined automobiles and the big dog with the massive head sprawled in front of the trailer sent a slightly different message. This was a junkyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah took one look at the huge dog and decided to leave Winston in the car. “Whatever you do, don’t let him out,” she said as Rafe opened the door on his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe eyed the animal lying in the shade of the tattered awning that shielded the trailer door. “Have a little faith. We’re talking brains versus brawn here. My money’s on Winston.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are not going to put that to the test.” Hannah looked at Winston through the two-inch crack she had left between the window and the top of the car door frame. “Don’t do anything to provoke that beast, understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinston whined softly. His rear legs were planted on the seat she had just vacated, his front paws braced against the door. Ears alert, nose quivering, he stared through the window, his whole attention concentrated on the other dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shuddered at the thought of what might happen if Winston got out of the car. She checked the passenger door to make certain that it was firmly shut and then sent Rafe a warning glance over the low roof of the Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be sure you close that door firmly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You worry too much,” Rafe said. He gave the Porsche door a rather casual push. “Winston’s smart. He can handle that guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the big dog heave his bulk to his feet. “I’m sure I’m a lot smarter than that monster, too. But I wouldn’t want to get into a fight with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay. Winston stays in the car.” Rafe walked to the gate and leaned on a grimy button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds later the door of the trailer opened. Dell Sadler appeared, silhouetted in the gloom. He gazed at Rafe and Hannah, his face shadowed by the brim of a greasy billed cap. After a while he apparently came to a decision. He started toward the gate. The dog paced stiffly after him, moving with the painfully awkward stride of an animal who was either very old or had been badly injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDell crossed the yard, weaving his way between piles of tires, crumpled fenders, and assorted mutilated auto parts. When he reached the gate he made no move to open it. He stared balefully at Rafe through the chain links. The dog came to a halt beside him and stared too. Dell did not look down, but he put his hand on the creature’s head in a gesture that was at once calming and absently affectionate. The bond between man and beast was evident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Happy,” Dell said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite suddenly Hannah found it difficult to believe that this man had tried to murder Winston last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What d’ya want?” Dell asked gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to talk to you, Dell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kaitlin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDell’s shoulders stiffened visibly. He hesitated for a long time. Then he reached for the latch. “You better come inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gate swung open. Dell led the way through the piles of dead automobiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tidy interior of the trailer was a surprise. Hannah glanced surreptitiously around as she sat down on the worn vinyl-covered couch. There was a good reading lamp on the built-in end table. A pile of magazines bearing recent dates was stacked beside it. A new mystery novel by a familiar author lay on the miniature coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDell hovered in the little kitchen. He appeared nervous, uneasy, as if he was not sure how to handle guests. “You want something to drink? I got some soda and beer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soda’s fine,” Rafe said. “Whatever’s handy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soda sounds great,” Hannah said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” Dell opened the refrigerator and hauled out two cans. He carried them into the living room portion of the trailer and set them on the table in front of Rafe and Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah glanced through the screen door of the trailer, studying the dog sprawled outside. “What happened to your dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Happy got run over by some drunk bastard on the highway while we was out on a tow job one night. Messed up his rear legs pretty bad. Vet told me I oughta put him down, but I just couldn’t do that. Cost me a fortune, but what was I gonna do? Me and Happy are partners, y’know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Hannah said. Definitely not a dog killer, she thought. But if Dell Sadler wasn’t the one who had put Winston out on the rocks in Dead Hand Cove, who had? “Someone tried to kill my dog last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would anyone wanna kill a dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We think it may have been meant as a warning of some kind,” she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think maybe I tried to hurt your dog on accounta what happened to Kaitlin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It crossed our minds,” Rafe admitted. “You’re the only one I can think of who might have wanted to avenge Kaitlin’s death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” Dell said again. He sank down onto a threadbare chair and stared at the logo on the can in his hand. “I wouldn’t hurt no dog. That little pooch of yours didn’t have anything to do with what happened to my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right.” Rafe leaned forward, legs spread. He held the can of soda loosely in his fingers between his knees. Serious but nonthreatening. Man to man. “I’ll come to the point, Dell. I know you think I killed Kaitlin. I didn’t. That’s the God’s honest truth. You’ll believe what you want to believe, but in the meantime, I really need to know why you’re so sure I’m guilty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDell turned the can between his hands. Eventually he looked up. “I always figured it was you because you were the last one with her that night. Everyone said you were pissed that she was playing around.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-53.html","bookId":1795,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM"}
