Kensidan kept the measure of his approach and seemed in no hurry to interrupt her spellcasting. Arabeth blasted him full force with a lightning bolt, one that should have lifted him out of his high boots, however tight the lacing, and sent him flying across the room to slam into the back wall, a blast that should have burned a hole into him and sent his black hair to dancing, a blast that should have sent his heart to trembling before stopping all together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightning burst out from Arabeth\u0027s fingers, then just...stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArabeth\u0027s face crinkled in a most unflattering expression and she gave a little cry and stumbled to her right, toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Kensidan, tingling with power, knew he\u0027d been right to trust the voices in the darkness all along. He rushed forward just enough to tap Arabeth on the shoulder as she rushed past, and in that touch, he released all of the energy of her lightning bolt, energy that had been caught and held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman flew through the air, but not so far, for she had enacted many wards before entering the room and much of the magic was absorbed. Of more concern, a globe of blackness appeared at the door, blocking her way. She gave a little yelp and staggered off to the side again, the Crow laughing behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree figures stepped out from the globe of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan watched Arabeth all the while, grinning as her eyes opened, as she tried to scream, and stumbled again, falling to the floor on her behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second of the dark elves thrust his hands out toward her, and the woman\u0027s screams became an indecipherable babble as a wave of mental energy rushed through her, jumbling her thoughts and sensibilities. She continued her downward spiral to lay on the floor, babbling and curling up like a frightened child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your plan?\" said the leader of the drow, the one with the gigantic plumed hat and the foppish garb. \"Or do you intend to have others fight all of your battles this day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan nodded, an admission that it did indeed seem that way. \"I must make my mark for the greater purpose we intend,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well said,\" the drow replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deudermont is mine,\" the high captain promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A formidable foe,\" said the drow. \"And one we might be better off allowing to run away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan didn\u0027t miss that the psionicist gave his master a curious, almost incredulous look at that. A free Deudermont wouldn\u0027t give up the fight, and would surely return with many powerful allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see,\" was all the Crow could promise. He looked to Arabeth. \"Don\u0027t kill her. She will be loyal...and pleasurable enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow with the big hat tipped it at that, and Kensidan nodded his gratitude. Then he flipped his cloak up high to the sides and as it descended, Kensidan seemed to melt beneath its dropping black wings. Then he was a bird, a large crow. He flew to the sill of his open window and leaped off for Suljack\u0027s palace, a place he knew quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will be a good ally,\" Kimmuriel said to Jarlaxle, who had resumed the helm of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. \"As long as we never trust him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wistful and nostalgic sigh escaped Jarlaxle\u0027s lips as he replied, \"Just like home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny thoughts Regis had of rushing in to help his friend disappeared when Drizzt and this curious dwarf joined in battle, a start so furious and brutal that the halfling figured it to be over before he could even draw his - in light of the titanic struggle suddenly exploding before him - pitiful little mace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorningstar and scimitar crossed in a dizzying series of vicious swings, more a matter of the combatants trying to get a feel for each other than either trying to land a killing blow. What stunned Regis the most was the way the dwarf kept up with Drizzt. He had seen the dark elf in battle many times, but the idea that the short, stout, thick-limbed creature swinging unwieldy morningstars could pace him swing for swing had the halfling gaping in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there it was. The dwarf\u0027s weapon hummed across and Drizzt angled his blade, swinging opposite, just enough to force a miss. He didn\u0027t want to connect a thin scimitar to one of those spiked balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morningstar head flew past and the dwarf didn\u0027t pull it up short, but let it swing far out to his left to connect on the wall of the alleyway, and when it did, the ensuing explosion revealed that there was more than a little magic in that weapon. A huge chunk of the building blasted away, leaving a gaping hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling his own swing short, his feet sped by his magical anklets, Drizzt saw the opening and charged ahead, only wincing slightly at the crashing blast when the morningstar hit the wooden wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the slight wince was too much; the momentary distraction too long. Regis saw it and gasped. The dwarf was already into his duck and turn as the spiked ball took out the wall, coming fast around, his left arm at full extension, his second morningstar head whistling out as wide as it could go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf his opponent hadn\u0027t been a dwarf, but a taller human, Drizzt likely would have had his left leg caved in underneath him, but as the morningstar head came around a bit lower, the drow stole his own forward progress in the blink of a surprised eye and threw himself into a leap and back flip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morningstar hit nothing but air, the drow landing lightly on his feet some three strides back from the dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, against a lesser opponent, there would have been a clear opening then. The great twirling swing had brought the dwarf to an overbalanced and nearly defenseless state. But so strong was he that he growled himself right out of it. He ran a couple of steps straight away from Drizzt, diving into a forward roll and turning as he did so that when he came up, over, and around, he was again directly squared to the drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore impressively, even as he came up straight, his arms already worked the morningstars, creating a smooth rhythm once again. The balls spun at the ends of their respective chains, ready to block or strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you hurt him?\" Regis asked incredulously, not meaning for Drizzt to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow did hear, though, as was evidenced by his responding shrug as he and the dwarf engaged yet again. They began to circle, Drizzt sliding to put his back along the wall the morningstar had just demolished, the dwarf staying opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the look on Drizzt\u0027s face as he turned the back side of that circle that alerted Regis to trouble, for the drow suddenly broke concentration on his primary target, his eyes going wide as he looked Regis\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurely on instinct, Regis snapped out his mace and spun, swinging wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit the thrusting sword right before it would have entered his back. Regis gave a yelp of surprise, and still got cut across his left arm as he turned. He fell back against the wall, his desperate gaze going to Drizzt, and he found himself trying to yell out, \"No!\" as if all the world had suddenly turned upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Drizzt had started to sprint Regis\u0027s way, and so quick was he that against almost any enemy, he would have been able to cleanly disengage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that dwarf wasn\u0027t any enemy, and Regis could only stare in horror as the dwarf\u0027s primary hand weapon, the one that had blown so gaping a hole in the building, came on a backhand at the passing drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt sensed it, or anticipated it, and he dived into a forward roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t avoid the morningstar, and his roll went all the faster for the added momentum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, the blow didn\u0027t prove lethal, though, and the drow came right around in a full run at Regis\u0027s attacker - who, spying his certain doom, tried to run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even begin his turn, backstepping still, when Drizzt caught him, scimitars working in a blur. The man\u0027s sword went flying in moments, and he fell back and to the ground, his chest stabbed three separate times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the drow and at Regis for just a moment before falling flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt spun as if expecting pursuit, but the dwarf was still far back in the alleyway, casually spinning his morningstars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get to Deudermont,\" Drizzt whispered to Regis, and he tucked one scimitar under his other arm and put his open hand out and low. As soon as Regis stepped into it, Drizzt hoisted him up to grab onto the low roof of the shed and pull himself over as Drizzt hoisted him to his full outstretched height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow turned the moment Regis was out of sight, scimitars in hand, but still the dwarf had not approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could\u0027ve killed ye to death, darkskin,\" the dwarf said. \"Could\u0027ve put me magic on the ball that clipped ye, and oh, but ye\u0027d still be rollin\u0027! Clear out o\u0027 the streets and into the bay, ye\u0027d still be rollin\u0027! Bwahahahaha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis looked to Drizzt, and was shocked to see that his friend was not disagreeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or I could\u0027ve just chased ye down the hall,\" the dwarf went on. \"Quick as ye were rid o\u0027 that fool wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve been quick enough to set yerself against the catastrophe coming yer way from behind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the drow didn\u0027t disagree. \"But you didn\u0027t,\" Drizzt said, walking slowly back toward his adversary. \"You didn\u0027t enact the morningstar\u0027s magic and you didn\u0027t pursue me. Twice you had the win, by your own boast, and twice you didn\u0027t take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, wasn\u0027t fair!\" bellowed the dwarf. \"What\u0027s the fun in that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you have honor,\" said Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got nothin\u0027 else, elf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why waste it?\" Drizzt cried. \"You are a fine warrior, to be sure. Join with me and with Deudermont. Put your skills -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the dwarf interrupted. \"To the cause of good? There ain\u0027t no cause of good, ye fool elf. Not in the fightin\u0027. There\u0027s only them wantin\u0027 more power, and the killers like yerself and meself helpin\u0027 one side or the other side - they\u0027re both the same side, ye see - climb to the top o\u0027 the hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Drizzt. \"There is more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bwahahahaha!\" roared the dwarf. \"Still a young one, I\u0027m guessin\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can offer you amnesty, here and now,\" said Drizzt. \"All past crimes will be forgiven, or at least...not asked about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bwahahahaha!\" the dwarf roared again. \"If ye only knowed the half of it, elf, ye wouldn\u0027t be so quick to put Athrogate by yer side!\" And with that, he charged, yelling, \"Have at it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt paused only long enough to look up at Regis and snap, \"Go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis had barely clambered two crawling steps up the steep roof when he heard the pair below come crashing together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scream louder,\" the Crow ordered, and he twisted his dagger deeper into the belly of the woman, who readily complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Kensidan, giggling at his own cleverness, tossed the pained woman aside, as the door to the room crashed open and Captain Deudermont, diverted by the screams from his rush to the kitchen service door of Suljack\u0027s palace, charged in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noble to a fault,\" said Kensidan. \"And with the road of retreat clear before you. I suppose I should salute you, but alas, I simply don\u0027t feel like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont\u0027s gaze went from the injured woman to the son of Rethnor, who reclined casually against a window sill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you taken in the view, Captain?\" Kensidan asked. \"The fall of the City of Sails...It\u0027s a marvelous thing, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you do this?\" Deudermont asked, coming forward in cautious and measured steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I?\" Kensidan replied. \"It was not Ship Rethnor that went against the Hosttower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That fight is ended, and won.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This fight is that fight, you fool,\" said Kensidan. \"When you decapitated Luskan, you set into motion this very struggle for power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could have joined forces and ruled from a position of justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Justice for the poor - ah, yes, that is the beauty of your rhetoric,\" Kensidan replied in a mocking tone, and he hopped up from the window sill and drew his sword to compliment the long dagger. \"And has it not occurred to the captain of a pirate hunter that not all the poor of Luskan are so deserving of justice? Or that there are afoot in the city many who wouldn\u0027t prosper as well under such an idyllic design?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is why I needed the high captains, fool,\" Deudermont countered, spitting every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you be so innocent, Deudermont, as to believe that men like us would willingly surrender power?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you be so cynical, Kensidan, son of Rethnor, as to be blind to the possibilities of the common good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live among pirates, so I fought them with piracy,\" Kensidan replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had a choice. You could have changed things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you had a choice. You could have minded your own business. You could have left Luskan alone, and now, more recently, you could have simply gone home. You accuse me of pride and greed for not following you, but in truth, it\u0027s your own pride that blinded you to the realities of this place you would remake in your likeness, and your own greed that has kept you here. A tragedy, indeed, for here you will die, and Luskan will steer onto a course even farther from your hopes and dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the floor, the woman groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take her out of here,\" Deudermont said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Kensidan replied. \"All you have to do is kill me, and she\u0027s yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any further hesitation, Captain Deudermont launched himself forward at the son of Rethnor, his fine sword cutting a trail before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan tried to execute a parry with his dagger, thinking to bring his sword to bear for a quick kill, but Deudermont was far too fast and practiced. Kensidan wound up only barely tapping the thrusting sword with his dagger before flailing wildly with his own sword to hardly move Deudermont\u0027s aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain retracted quickly and thrust again, pulled up short before another series of wild parry attempts, then thrust forth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but you are good!\" said Kensidan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont didn\u0027t let up through the compliment, but launched another thrust then retracted and brought his sword up high for a following downward strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan barely got his sword up horizontally above him to block, and as he did, he turned, for his back was nearing a wall. The weight of the blow had him scrambling to keep his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont methodically pursued, unimpressed by the son of Rethnor\u0027s swordsmanship. In the back of his mind, he wondered why the young fool would dare to come against him so. Was his hubris so great that he fancied himself a swordsman? Or was he faking incompetence to move Deudermont off his guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that warning ringing in his thoughts, Deudermont moved at his foe with a flurry, but measured every strike so he could quickly revert to a fully defensive posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no counterattack came, not even when it seemed as if he had obviously overplayed his attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain didn\u0027t show his smile, but the conclusion seemed inescapable: Kensidan was no match for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman groaned again, bringing rage to Deudermont, and he assured himself that his victory would strike an important blow for the retribution he would surely bring with him on his return to the City of Sails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he went for the kill, skipping in fast, smashing Kensidan\u0027s sword out wide and rolling his blade so as to avoid the awkward parry of the dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan leaped straight up in the air, but Deudermont knew he would have him fast on his descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that Kensidan didn\u0027t come down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont\u0027s confusion only multiplied as he heard the thrum of large wings above him and as one of those large black-feathered appendages batted him about the head, sending him staggering aside. He turned and waved his sword to fend him off, but Kensidan the Crow wasn\u0027t following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set down with a hop on three-toed feet, a gigantic, man-sized crow. His bird eyes regarded Deudermont from several angles, head twitching left and right to take in the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nickname well-earned,\" Deudermont managed to say, trying hard to parse his words correctly and coherently, trying hard not to let on how off balance the man\u0027s sudden transformation into the outrageous creature had left him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crow skipped his way and Deudermont presented his sword defensively. Wings going wide, the Crow leaped up, clawed feet coming forward, black wings assaulting Deudermont from either side. He slashed at one, trying to fall back, and did manage to dislodge a few black feathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Crow came on with squawking fury, throwing forward his torso and feet as he beat his wings back. Deudermont tried to bring his sword in to properly fend the creature off. Six toes, widespread, all ending with lethal talons clawed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe managed to nick one of the feet, but the Crow dropped it fast out of harm\u0027s way, while the other foot slipped past the captain\u0027s defenses and caught hold of his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wings beat furiously, the Crow changing his angle as he raked that foot down, tearing the captain from left shoulder to right hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont brought his sword slashing across, but the creature was too fast and too nimble, and the taloned foot slipped out of his reach. The bird came forward and pecked the captain hard in the right shoulder, sending him flying to the ground, stealing all sensation and strength from his sword arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wing beat and a leap had the Crow straddling the fallen man. Deudermont tried to roll upright, but the next peck hit him on the head, slamming him back to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood poured down from his brow across his left eye and cheek, but more than that, opaque liquid blurred the captain\u0027s sight as, thoroughly dazed, he faded in and out of consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis kept his head down, focusing solely on the task before him. Crawling on hands and knees, picking each handhold cautiously but expediently, the halfling made his way up the steep roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have to get to Deudermont,\" he told himself, pulling himself along, increasing his pace as he gained confidence with the climb. He finally hit his stride and was just about to look up when he bumped into something hard. High, black boots filled his vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis froze and slowly lifted his gaze, up past the fine fabric of well-tailored trousers, up past a fabulously crafted belt buckle, a fine gray vest and white shirt, to a face he never expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" he cried in dismay and horror, desperately throwing his arms up before his face as a small crossbow leveled his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exaggerated movement cost the halfling his balance, but even the unexpected tumble didn\u0027t save him from being stuck in the neck by the quarrel. Down the roof Regis tumbled, darkness rushing up all around him, stealing the strength from his limbs, stealing the light from his eyes, stealing even his voice as he tried to cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf\u0027s swings didn\u0027t come any slower as he rejoined battle against Drizzt. And Drizzt quickly realized that the dwarf wasn\u0027t even breathing hard. Using his anklets to speed his steps, Drizzt pushed the issue, scampering to the left, then right back around the dwarf, and out and back suddenly as the furious little creature spun to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow worked a blur of measured strikes, and exaggerated steps, forcing the stubby-limbed dwarf to rush every which way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flurry went on and on, scimitars rolling one over the other, morningstars spinning to keep pace, and even, once in a while, to offer a devious counter-stroke. And still Drizzt pressed, rushing left and back to center, right and all the way around, forcing the dwarf to continually reverse momentum on his heavier weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Athrogate did so with ease, and showed no labored breath, and whenever a thrust or parry connected, weapon to weapon, Drizzt was reminded of the dwarf\u0027s preternatural strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Athrogate possessed it all: speed, stamina, strength, and technique. He was as complete a fighter as Drizzt had ever battled, and with weapons to equal Drizzt\u0027s own. The first morningstar kept coating over with some explosive liquid, and the second head leaked a brownish fluid. The first time that connected in a parry against Icingdeath, Drizzt was sure he felt the scimitar\u0027s fear. He brought the blade back for a quick inspection as he broke away, angling for a new attack, and noted dots of brown on is shining metal. It was rust, he realized, and realized, too, that only the mighty magic of Icingdeath had saved the blade from rotting away in his hand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Athrogate just kept howling, \"Bwahahahaha!\" and charging on with abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeming abandon, because never, ever, did the dwarf abandon his defensive technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was good. Very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut so was Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark elf slowed his attacks and let Athrogate gain momentum, until it was the dwarf, not the drow, pressing the advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bwahahahaha!\" Athrogate roared, and sent both his morningstars into aggressive spins, low and high, working one down, the other up in a dizzying barrage that nearly caught up to the dodging, parrying drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt measured every movement, his eyes moving three steps ahead. He thrust into the left, forcing a parry, then went with that block to send his scimitar out wide but in an arcing movement that brought it back in again, sweeping down at his shorter opponent\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAthrogate was up to the task of parrying, as Drizzt knew he would be, bringing his left-hand morningstar flying up across his right shoulder to defeat the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t really an attack, and Icingdeath snuck in for a stab at Athrogate\u0027s side. The dwarf yelped and leaped back, clearing three long strides. He laughed again, but winced, and brought his hand down against his rib. When he brought that hand back up, both Drizzt and he understood that the drow had drawn first blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done!\" he said, or started to, for Drizzt leaped at him, scimitars working wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt rolled them over each other in a punishing alternating downward and straightforward slash, keeping them timed perfectly so that one morningstar could not defeat them both, and keeping them angled perfectly so that Athrogate had to keep his own weapons at a more awkward and draining angle, up high in front of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf\u0027s grimace told Drizzt that his stab in the ribs had been more effective than Athrogate pretended, and holding his arms up in such a manner was not comfortable at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow kept up the roll and pressed the advantage, driving Athrogate ever backward, both combatants knowing that one slip by Drizzt would do no more than put them back at an even posture, but one slip by Athrogate would likely end the fight in short order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf wasn\u0027t laughing anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt pressed him even harder, growling with every rolling swing, backing Athrogate back down the alley the way Drizzt had come, away from the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt caught the movement out of the corner of his eye, a small form rolling limply off the roof. Without a whimper, without a cry of alarm, Regis, tumbled to the ground and lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAthrogate seized the distraction for his advantage, and cut back and to his right, then smashed his morningstar across to bat the drow\u0027s chopping scimitar out far to the side with such force - and an added magical explosion - that Drizzt had to disengage fully and scamper to the opposite wall to simply hold onto the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt got a look at Regis, lying awkwardly twisted in the alleyway\u0027s gutter. Not a sound, not a squirm, not a whimper of pain....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was somewhere past pain; it seemed to Drizzt as if his spirit had already left his battered body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Drizzt couldn\u0027t go to him. Drizzt, who had chosen to return to Luskan, to stand with Deudermont, couldn\u0027t do anything but look at his dear friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt sea, it\u0027s said that danger can be measured by the scurry of the rats, and if that model held true, then the battle between Robillard and Arklem Greeth in the hold of Sea Sprite ranked right up alongside beaching the boat on the back of a dragon turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll manner of evocations flew out between the dueling wizards, fire and ice, magical energy of different colors and inventive shapes. Robillard tried to keep his spells more narrow in scope, aiming just for Arklem Greeth, but the lich was as full of hatred for Sea Sprite herself as he was for his old peer in the Hosttower. Robillard threw missiles of solid magic and acidic darts. Greeth responded with forked lightning bolts and fireballs, filling the hold with flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard\u0027s work on the hull with magical protections and wards, and all manner of alchemical mixtures, had been as complete and as brilliant as the work of any wizard or team of wizards had ever put on any ship, but he knew with every mighty explosion that Arklem Greeth tested those wards to their fullest and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every fireball, a few more residual flames burned for just a few heartbeats longer. Every successive lightning bolt thumped the planking out a bit wider, and a little more water managed to seep in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon enough, the wizards stood among a maelstrom of destruction, water up to their ankles, Sea Sprite rocking hard with every blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard knew he had to get Arklem Greeth out of his ship. Whatever the cost, whatever else might happen, he had to move the spell duel to another place. He launched into a mighty spell, and as he cast it, he threw himself at Greeth, thinking that both he and his adversary would be projected into the Astral Plane to finish the insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened, for the archmage arcane had already applied a dimensional lock to the hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard staggered as he realized that he was not flying on another plane of existence, as he had anticipated. He threw his arms up defensively as he righted himself, for Arklem Greeth brought in a gigantic disembodied fist that punched at him with the force of a titan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blow didn\u0027t break through the stoneskin dweomer of mighty Robillard, but it did send him flying back to the other end of the hold. He hit the wall hard, but felt not a thing, landing lightly on his feet and launching immediately into another lightning bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArklem Greeth, too, was already into a new casting, and his spell went off right before Robillard\u0027s, creating a summoned wall of stone halfway between the combatants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard\u0027s lightning bolt hit that stone with such tremendous force that huge chunks flew, but the bolt also rebounded into the wizard\u0027s face, throwing him again into the wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had exhausted his wards. He felt that impact, and felt, too, the sizzle of his own lightning bolt. His heart palpitated, his hair stood on end. He kept his awareness just enough to realize that Sea Sprite was listing badly as a result of the tremendous weight of Arklem Greeth\u0027s summoned wall. From up above he heard screaming, and he knew that more than one of Sea Sprite\u0027s crew had fallen overboard as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the way, beyond the wall, Arklem Greeth cackled with delight, and in looking at the wall, Robillard understood that the worst was yet to come. For Greeth had offset it on the floor and had lined it along with the length and not the breadth of the ship, but he had not anchored it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo as Sea Sprite listed under the great weight, so too leaned the wall, and it was beginning to tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard realized that he couldn\u0027t stop it, so he found a moment of intense concentration instead and focused on his most-hated enemy. The wall fell, clearing the ground between the wizards, and Robillard let fly another devastating lightning blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo intent was he on his stone wall tumbling into Sea Sprite\u0027s side planking, crashing through the wood, that Arklem Greeth never saw the bolt coming. He flew backward under the power of the stroke and hit the wall even as the side of the hull broke open and Luskan Harbor rushed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard beat the rush of water, launching himself upon Arklem Greeth. Energy crackled through his hands, one electrical discharge after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArklem Greeth fought back physically, tearing at Robillard with undead hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey held their death grip on each other as the sea turned Sea Sprite farther on her side, taking her down into the harbor. Spell after spell leaped from Robillard\u0027s fingers into the lich, blasting away at his magical defenses, and when those were finally beaten, as was his very life-force, still Arklem Greeth merely held on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lich didn\u0027t need to breathe, but Robillard surely did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pitch of the sinking ship sent them out through the hole in the hull, tumbling amidst the debris, rocks, and weeds of Luskan Harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard felt his ears pop under the pressure and knew his lungs wouldn\u0027t be far behind. But he held on, determined to end the struggle at whatever cost. The sight of Sea Sprite, the wreckage of his beloved Sea Sprite, spurred him on and he resisted the urge to break free of Arklem Greeth and focused instead on continuing his electrical barrage on the lich - even though every powerful discharge stung him as well in the conducting water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like a dozen, dozen spells. It seemed like his lungs would surely burst. It seemed like Arklem Greeth was mocking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the lich simply let go, and the face the surprised Robillard looked into was dead, not undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard shoved away and kicked off the bottom, determined not to die in the arms of the hideous Arklem Greeth. Instinctively he clawed for the surface, and saw the water growing lighter above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he knew he wouldn\u0027t make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sea Sprite!\" more than one sailor of Thrice Lucky, and of every other ship moored in the area, cried out in astonishment. To those men and women, friend and enemy of Deudermont\u0027s ship alike, the sight before them seemed impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waves took Sea Sprite and smashed her up on a line of rocks, just one rail of her glorious hull and her three distinctive masts protruding from the dark waters of Luskan Harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could not be. In the minds of those who knew the ship as friend or foe, the loss of Sea Sprite proved no less traumatic than the disintegration of the Hosttower of the Arcane, a sudden and unimaginable change in the landscape that had shaped their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sea Sprite!\" they cried as one, pointing and jumping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik the Rogue and Bellany rushed to Thrice Lucky\u0027s rail to take in the awful scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we to do?\" Morik asked incredulously. \"Where is Maimun?\" He knew the answer, and so did many others echoing that very sentiment, for their captain had gone ashore less than an hour earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome crewmen called for lifelines, to weigh anchor to rush to the aid of the crew in the water. Bellany did likewise and started for a lifeboat, but Morik grabbed her by the shoulder and spun her to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make me fly!\" he bade her, and she looked at him curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me flight!\" he screamed. \"You\u0027ve done it before!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellany rubbed her hands together and tried to focus, tried to remember the words as the insanity around her only multiplied. She reached out and touched Morik on the shoulder and the man leaped up to the rail and out from the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t fall into the water, though, but flew out across the bay. He scanned, trying to figure out where he was most needed, then cut across for the downed vessel herself, fearing that some of the crew might be trapped aboard her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he crossed over a form in the water, just under the surface but sinking fast, and willed himself to stop. He slapped his hand down, plunging it through the waves, and grabbed hard on the fine fabric of a wizard\u0027s robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, the glorious pain,\" Kensidan taunted. Deudermont again tried to pull himself up and the Crow pecked him hard on the forehead, slamming him back to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room\u0027s door banged open. \"No!\" cried a voice familiar to both men. \"Let him go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you mad, young pirate?\" the Crow cackled as he turned to regard Maimun. He spun back and slammed Deudermont hard again, smashing him flat to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun responded with a sudden and brutal charge, flashing sword leading the way. Kensidan beat his wings and tried to extricate himself from the close quarters, but Maimun\u0027s fury was too great and his advantage too sudden and complete. The wings battered around the perimeter of the fight, but Maimun\u0027s sword cut a narrower and more direct line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the span of a few heartbeats, Maimun had Kensidan pinned at the end of his blade, and when Kensidan tried to turn the sword with his beak, Maimun got the blade inside the Crow\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that awkward and devastating clutch, Kensidan could offer no further resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun, breathing hard, clearly outraged, held the pose and the pin for a long breath. \"I give you your life,\" he said finally, easing the blade just a bit. \"You have the city - there will be no challenge. I will go, and I\u0027m taking Captain Deudermont with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan looked over at the battered and bloody form of Deudermont and started to cackle, but Maimun stopped that with a prod of his well-placed blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will allow us clear passage to our ships, and for our ships out of Luskan Harbor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is already dead, fool, or soon enough to be!\" the Crow argued, slurring every word, as he spouted them around the hard steel of a fine blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words nearly buckled Maimun\u0027s knees. His thoughts swirled back in time to his first meeting with the captain. He had stowed away onSea Sprite, fleeing a demon intent on his destruction. Deudermont had allowed him to stay. Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, generous to a fault, had not abandoned him when they\u0027d learned the truth of his ordeal, even when they discerned that having Maimun aboard made them targets of the powerful demon and its many deadly allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Deudermont had saved young Maimun, without a doubt, and had taken him under his wing and trained him in the ways of the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Maimun had betrayed him. Though he had never expected it to come to so tragic an end, the young pirate captain could not deny the truth. Paid by Kensidan, Maimun had sailed Arabeth to Quelch\u0027s Folly. Maimun had played a role in the catastrophe that had befallen Luskan, and in the catastrophe that had lain Captain Deudermont low before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun turned back sharply on Kensidan and pressed the sword in tighter. \"I will have your word, Crow, that I will be allowed free passage, with Deudermont and Sea Sprite beside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKensidan stared at him hatefully with those black crow eyes. \"Do you understand who I am now, young pirate?\" he replied slowly, and as evenly as the prodding blade allowed. \"Luskan is mine. I am the Pirate King.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re to be the dead Pirate King if I don\u0027t get your word!\" Maimun assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as Maimun spoke, Kensidan all but disappeared beneath him, almost instantly reverting to the form of a small crow. He rushed out from under the overbalanced Maimun and with a flap of his wings, fluttered up to light on the windowsill across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun wrung his hands on his sword hilt, grimacing in frustration as he turned to regard the Crow, expecting that his world had just ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have my word,\" Kensidan said, surprising him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have nothing with which to barter,\" Maimun stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crow shrugged, a curious movement from the bird, but one that conveyed the precise sentiment clearly enough. \"I owe Maimun ofThrice Lucky that much, at least,\" said Kensidan. \"So we will forget this incident, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun could only stare at the bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I look forward to seeing your sails in my harbor again,\" Kensidan finished, and he flew away out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaimun stood there stunned for a few moments then rushed to Deudermont, falling to his knees beside the broken man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first attacks after seeing Regis fall were measured, his first defenses almost half-hearted. Drizzt could hardly find his focus, with his friend lying there in the gutter, could hardly muster the energy necessary to stand his ground against the dwarf warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps sensing that very thing, or perhaps thinking it all a ploy, Athrogate didn\u0027t press in those first few moments of rejoined battle, measuring his own strikes to gain strategic advantage rather than going for the sudden kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Drizzt internalized the shock and the pain, and as he always had before, took it and turned the tumult into a narrowly-focused burst of outrage. His scimitars picked up their pace, the strength of his strikes increasing proportionately. He began to work Athrogate as he had before the fall of Regis, moving side to side and forcing the dwarf to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dwarf did match his pace, fighting Drizzt to a solid draw strike after thrust after slash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what a glorious draw it was to any who might have chanced to look on. The combatants spun with abandon, scimitars and morningstars humming through the air. Athrogate hit a wall again, the spiked ball smashing the wood to splinters. He hit the cobblestones before the backward-leaping drow and crushed them to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there Drizzt scored his second hit, Twinkle nicking Athrogate\u0027s cheek and taking away one of his great beard\u0027s braids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, but ye\u0027ll pay for that, elf!\" the dwarf roared, and on he came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the side, Regis groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt turned away from Athrogate and fled across the alleyway, the dwarf in close pursuit. The drow leaped to the wall, throwing his shoulders back and planting one foot solidly as if he meant to run right up the side of the structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, to Athrogate\u0027s discerning and seasoned battle sensibilities, to flip a backward somersault right over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf pulled up short and whirled, shouting \"Bwaha! I\u0027m knowin\u0027 that move!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Drizzt didn\u0027t fly over him and come down in front of him, and the drow, who had not used his planted foot to push off, and who had not brought his second foot up to further climb, replied, \"I know you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind the turned dwarf, down the alley, Guenhwyvar roared, like an exclamation point to Drizzt\u0027s victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor indeed the win was his; he could only pray that Regis was not beyond his help. Icingdeath slashed down at Athrogate\u0027s defenseless head, surely a blow that would split the dwarf\u0027s head apart. He took little satisfaction in that win as his blade connected against Athrogate\u0027s skull, as he felt the transfer of deadly energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dwarf didn\u0027t seem to even feel it, no blood erupted, and Drizzt\u0027s blade didn\u0027t bounce aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt had felt that curious sensation before, as if he had landed a blow without consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he didn\u0027t sort it out quickly enough, didn\u0027t understand the source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAthrogate spun, morningstars flying desperately.
