One still had to bear in mind that even if the four Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperors had the Destruction Attribute, both Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were also formidable existences of Maximum Level Heavenly Emperors. As such, they might not be able to fight one against two, but if it were just one against one… heh heh.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter being struck by Zhou Weiqing’s hammer, the Second Grand Elder’s entire body went numb.

More so, at this point, the Second Grand Elder had his back facing the Demonic Emperor, and with his mind set on the ‘tournament fight’, he would never imagine that the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue would actually attack him from behind without thought of his own status.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn truth, at this point Wu Yunyue would hardly care about his status or prestige. The Heavenly Demon Sect had almost been wiped out by these Blood Red Hell powerhouses! If not for that, how could his talks with Zhou Weiqing be at such a disadvantage, where Zhou Weiqing held all the cards? He truly hated the Blood Red Hell, and as long as he could have his vengeance, who would give a damn about face now!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Heavenly Demon Blade slashed down, and behind Wu Yunyue’s back, a cloud of misty lights burst forth.

Wu Yunyue’s Core Natal Plant was named the Despair Hibiscus, one that did exist naturally in the wild. It did not have a poisonous nature, but upon contact with it, its inherent Demonic nature would burst forth with a powerful Demonic Venom, one created out of the Demonic Attribute. It was similar in nature to the Dark Demon God Lightning that Zhou Weiqing had, and was filled with vicious malice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePreviously, Zhou Weiqing had told Wu Yunyue that he would create an opportunity for him to strike. As such, Wu Yunyue had been fully prepared to do so at any time.

The Heavenly Demon Blade clashed savagely with the blood-red spear of the Second Grand Elder.

The Second Grand Elder vomited a mouthful of blood. His layer of defensive Heavenly Energy had already been broken through and scattered by Zhou Weiqing in that previous blow, and now the Despair Hibiscus seized the opportunity to slide forward, enveloping the Second Grand Elder’s body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA heart rending cry rang out as the Second Grand Elder shouted with sheer rage, unwillingness and dissatisfaction. “You dare to launch a sneak attack!

Instantly, the zone around him began to form an existence like that of a black hole. Once a Heavenly Emperor self-detonated, the area affected would be immense, and even the far off Heavenly Bow City would likely be affected. If that truly happened, the sheer amount of casualties would not be limited to just these few of them here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithout hesitation, Wu Yunyue vanished in a flash, leaving the battlefield as quickly as he could. The self-detonation of a Heavenly Emperor exceeded three times that of his strongest attack, and Wu Yunyue did not wish to die here like that. Furthermore, once a Heavenly Core Nucleus was ignited, the process was irreversible, and self-detonation was almost a certainty. Since this Second Grand Elder was definitely dying, how could he allow himself to be claimed as a ‘burial companion’.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, almost in the same instant, a massive hammer appeared right behind the Second Grand Elder’s back, a warped and twisted light swiftly enveloping the body in midst of self-detonation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat kid is insane!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWu Yunyue thought to himself. He could clearly see that Zhou Weiqing had just appeared behind the Second Grand Elder. No matter how outstanding and talented he was, that was self-detonation of a Heavenly Emperor! Was he looking for death?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, in the next moment, Wu Yunyue could only stare, stunned. That was because the Second Grand Elder’s self-detonation was halted just like that. The space around Zhou Weiqing and the Second Grand Elder seemed to distort itself violently momentarily before everything returned to its normal state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTime Reversal. The Skill notorious for being useless, yet Zhou Weiqing had his own ways of utilizing it. Ever since he had formed the Astral Saint Core Nucleus, he had just started to truly master this skill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, the Time Reversal no longer needed such a massive amount of energy, and it was also no longer restricted to reversing time for two hours. With the aid of his Astral Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing was able to fully control the amount of time reversed as well as the area of effect. Of course, if it was being used on an enemy, he would have to first remove all the defenses on the target first.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSince the Second Grand Elder was already going to self-detonate, what defenses would be left on him? As such, in just one single attempt, Zhou Weiqing had succeeded.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePreviously, after sending the Second Grand Elder flying back with his strike, Zhou Weiqing had already guessed the possible sequence of events that could occur. As such, he had already prepared the Time Reversal Skill as quickly as possible, before using a Blink Skill to reach at a perfect timing. However, when he had arrived behind the Second Grand Elder with the Blink Skill, it had nearly been influenced by the black hole deviation caused by the process of self-detonation, causing Zhou Weiqing to break out in cold sweat. Luckily, he had still managed to succeed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNaturally, his Dual Legendary Hammers were not just for the purpose of imbuing and strengthening his Stored Skills as he had just used! Such a heavy hammer blow, it had also shattered a large portion of the bones on the Second Grand Elder’s back. At this point, even if he wanted to re-ignite his Heavenly Core Nucleus and self-detonate once more, he would no longer be able to do so. In that moment, the light cloud of the Astral Saint Core Nucleus began to shine forth from Zhou Weiqing’s chest area.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHaving sustained such critical injuries, how could the Second Grand Elder possibly fight off Zhou Weiqing now? As Zhou Weiqing withdrew his hammers, he used his Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms to claw savagely at the Second Grand Elder’s back, activating the Devour Skill once more. At the same time, the sky darkened as he released the full powers of his Astral Saint Core Nucleus.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the surface, Zhou Weiqing had defeated a Heavenly Emperor so easily. In truth, this was the combined full force of himself and the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue joining hands to defeat the Second Grand Elder, especially with the elements of surprise and much scheming. Being the recipient of such a comprehensive nefarious plan, the Second Grand Elder naturally had a tragic ending. It could be said that the main reason why he had ended up in such a state was largely due to the series of Zhou Weiqing’s actions and acting.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTh..this is actually possible?!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWu Yunyue’s eyes widened in shock.

The First and Third Grand Elders of the Blood Red Hell might have taken a second to react, but they were still able to raise a defensive energy space, blocking the majority of the Dragon Silencing Seal rays. Only about seven or eight of the eight and nine Jeweled Blood Red Hell powerhouses were actually struck by the Dragon Silencing Seal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the Fourth Grand Elder had been smashed and destroyed so savagely by Long Shiya, both the First and Third Grand Elders had been shocked to the core.

Due to the previous agreement of this being a tournament match, as well as their hopes to gain Long Shiya and the others’ surrender, they had not intervened when Long Shiya had launched such a suicidal move. In their eyes, even though the Fourth Grand Elder was no match for Long Shiya, they were both Heavenly Emperors, and it should not be possible for Long Shiya to kill the Fourth Grand Elder with just a single blow.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe appearance of the Demonic Dragon Lady was just too abrupt. Up until the point when she had self-destructed, they had still not figured out whether it was a Heavenly Beast or just an energy construct.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the death of the Fourth Grand Elder, both the First and Third Grand Elder fell into a rage. Naturally, they would no longer care about the bet, and as one they charged towards Long Shiya. However, in that moment, the Demonic Dragon Lady self-detonated.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the First and Third Grand Elder’s cultivation, even if they were struck by the Dragon Silencing Seal, it would not have a great effect on them. However, they could not ignore the subordinates behind them. The Demonic Dragon Lady was after all a Max Level Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Beast, and the Dragon Silencing Seals released from its self-detonation would not be easy to withstand, even for a Heavenly King. If they allowed the rays to strike, it could be said that nearly all of their subordinates would lose the majority of their combat powers. With the death of the Fourth Grand Elder, their great advantage had already lessened considerably, and although they were in a great rage, they could not possibly ignore their subordinates. As such, they could only release their Consolidated Equipment and defend against the rays. Of course, this had also given the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor the chance to launch his own attacks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe entire sky had turned into six colours.
