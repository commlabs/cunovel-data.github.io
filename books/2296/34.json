She knew, knew, something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, she opened the door and stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy drapes at the window shut out the light, so that the room was nearly dark. As soon as she stepped inside the doorway, the overhead light went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension went out of her in a whoosh as Edward stepped in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward! You scared me out of a year\u0027s growth. What are you doing here? Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relief she had first felt at seeing him quickly turned to alarm as he stepped behind her and closed the door. \"Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go sit down, Marisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, and everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not making sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll understand soon enough.\" He gave her a little push and she stumbled forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that she saw Grigori. He lay still as death on the bed, bound by a heavy silver chain ... a chain that looked very much like the one that had once bound Alexi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward pulled a syringe out of his coat pocket. \"I put him to sleep, and then I bled him.\" He nodded at the basin on the table beside her chair. It was a large bowl, and it was filled with blood. Grigori\u0027s blood. Enough to weaken him. Enough to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not... not dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, please\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed her toward the chair in the corner. \"Sit down, Marisa. Alexi will be here soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexi! He\u0027s coming here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward nodded, his expression unutterably sad. \"I\u0027m sorry, Marisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down heavily. \"Why are you doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean? Of course you do....\" The words died in her throat. \"He\u0027s done something to you, hasn\u0027t he? Oh, Lord, you\u0027re like Antoinette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She had no mind of her own. Alexi has left me my mind, Marisa, but he has robbed me of my will.\" His voice was raw with torment. \"This is worse. I know what I\u0027m doing, and even though I don\u0027t want to, I can\u0027t refuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight him, Edward! You\u0027ve got to fight him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\" He began to pace the floor. \"He\u0027s too strong.\" He stopped in front of her, his eyes wild, his hands clenching and unclenching. \"He took my blood, made me take his. I can hear his thoughts in my mind. I can\u0027t shut them out!\" He placed his hands over his ears and shook his head. \"I can\u0027t shut him out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to kill us, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to kill Grigori. I\u0027m afraid he has worse things in mind for you.\" Edward dropped to his knees in front of Marisa. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" He pulled a short piece of rope out of his coat pocket. \"So sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinct overcame fear. With a cry, she jerked her knee up. It caught him under the jaw. His head snapped backward and she kicked him in the chest with all her might. The air whooshed out of his lungs as he fell to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJumping to her feet, she ran for the door. She screamed as she felt his hand close over her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go!\" she shrieked. \"Let me go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled against him, but he was too strong for her. Twisting her arm behind her back, he quickly tied her wrists together, then guided her back to the chair and pushed her into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marisa, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shaking now, frightened beyond words. Alexi was coming. She felt a ripple in the air, a stirring against her skin, and knew that Grigori was emerging from the dark sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward felt it, too. Reaching under his coat, he withdrew a sharpened stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t. Not unless I have to.\" He glanced at her over his shoulder. \"Alexi wants that pleasure for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, please, please don\u0027t do this. Please. I\u0027d rather be dead than become his creature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marisa.\" A groan rose in Edward\u0027s throat. She saw him struggle against Alexi\u0027s hold on his mind, saw the torment in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Edward. He\u0027ll make me like Antoinette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at her, helpless, every muscle in his body taut. Pain flickered in his eyes, and she knew that Alexi was reading Edward\u0027s mind, knew the vampire was exerting his influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I can\u0027t fight him,\" he said, panting heavily. \"He\u0027s too strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving stiffly, he stood up and backed away from her. \"I can\u0027t help you.\" Pain twisted his features and he bent at the waist, clutching his stomach. \"Stop,\" he begged. \"Please stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him writhe in agony. What was Alexi doing to him? Fighting the urge to scream, to give in to the panic surging through her, she began to work her hands back and forth in an effort to loosen the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head jerked up at the sound of Grigori\u0027s voice. She glanced at the bed. His eyes were closed. As far as she could tell, he hadn\u0027t moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you hurt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Are you all right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak... Alexi is coming... You must be strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you in pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver... it burns... makes me weak...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t fight Alexi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you crazy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are the one who is crazy, if you think you can defeat him. You are only a mortal, and a woman, at that. If you fight him, it will only be so much the worse for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you fust want me to submit? To let him kill you and then turn me into some kind of zombie? I don\u0027t think so!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very idea made her mad enough to spit. She was outraged that Grigori would even suggest they just give up without a fight. Adrenaline flowed through her as she tugged against the rope, and then, to her surprise, she felt the knots give, felt the rope loosen, just a little. The next thing she knew, one hand slipped free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at Grigori again. He still hadn\u0027t moved, but she could feel him smiling in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink you\u0027re pretty smart, don\u0027t you, she thought, getting me all riled up like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour hands are free, aren\u0027t they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa swallowed a grin. He knew her much too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden heaviness seemed to pulse through the air and she knew, with a sinking feeling of dread, that Alexi had arrived. The thought no sooner crossed her mind than he was there, in the room. Darkness seemed to trail in his wake, like a miasma of evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Alexi said. \"We are all together at last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa fought the urge to cringe in her chair. Clenching her fists, she stared at him, willing herself to be strong. Grigori\u0027s life depended on her now. Edward would be no help. Even now, he was kneeling in front of Alexi, accepting his master\u0027s terse words of praise for a job well done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, it is time I made the woman mine. You will leave the room. Wait for me in the hallway.\" Alexi sniffed the air, his nose wrinkling as the smell of cold blood reached his nostrils. He jerked his chin toward the bowl. \"Get rid of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Edward rose to his feet. Moving like a robot, he picked up the bowl and started toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" Marisa cried, \"don\u0027t leave me! Please, help me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\" He tried to turn to face her, his whole being longing to help her, to strike Alexi down, but the vampire\u0027s power was too strong to resist. He told himself to stop, to turn, but his body refused to obey. One step after another, he moved toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward!\" The fear and anguish in her voice stabbed him to the heart. But there was nothing he could do. Nothing...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey! I\u0027ve taken your blood, made you a part of me. Listen to my voice. Draw on my strength. You can fight him. Think! Combine your will with mine. Together we can defeat him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t. Edward stared into the bowl, at the blood that was so dark it was almost black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can! Marisa needs help, help I can\u0027t give her. Damn you! Fight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCradling the bowl in one arm, Edward opened the door and stepped into the hallway. He heard Marisa\u0027s shriek of terror as he closed the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexi leered at Marisa as he jerked her to her feet. Locking one arm around her waist, he caught her chin in his hand and kissed her, his tongue plunging into her mouth, choking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled against him, the taste of him making her gag. There was a darkness in his kiss that seemed to smother all the light in her soul. She kicked him, but he only laughed. Shaking the rope from her wrists, she scratched his face, clawed at his eyes, but he only laughed harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight me all you wish, woman; you cannot escape me. I will take you here, now, and there is nothing you can do about it. Nothing Chiavari can do to save you.\" Wicked laughter bubbled up from his throat. \"I know the power of those chains. He does not have the strength to remove them. Even now, the silver burns his flesh and weakens his powers. Only a vampyre who has lived as long as I could withstand them. And he is but a babe compared to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed down at her, his eyes glowing with hatred. \"He took Antoinette from me, and now I shall take you from him. I will defile you, here, in his presence, and then I shall destroy him. And when that is done, you will be mine for a hundred years. And he will know it. In whatever hell he finds himself, he will know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent her back over his arm and licked her face, laughing when she shuddered with revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is time to end the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing her by the hair, he forced her to her knees. \"Disrobe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa shook her head. She slid a glance at Grigori. His eyes were dark with hatred. She could see him trying to summon his power, knew he was trying to get past the pain, the loss of blood, trying to find the strength to free himself of the heavy silver that weighed him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do it! I know you can. She tried to will him her strength, rocked back on her heels as Alexi slapped her across the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was reaching for the zipper when the bedroom door slammed open and Edward burst into the room. Mouth stained with blood, eyes wild, he hurled himself at Alexi, the stake in his hand aimed for the vampire\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a cry, Marisa jumped to her feet. Hurrying to the bed, she lifted the heavy chain from Grigori\u0027s chest, and thrust her arm in his face. \"Hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t argue. She felt the prick of his fangs, the oddly sensual flow of blood from her veins. He seemed to drink forever, yet it was only a handful of seconds, and then he put her from him and rose to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wholly vampire now. His eyes blazed with a pure red flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa watched it all, too terrified to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward and Alexi were locked in a fierce embrace. The stake had missed Alexi\u0027s heart. He pulled it from his body with a savage cry and tossed it aside. Unmindful of the blood that spurted from his chest in a dark torrent, he flung Edward against the wall, held him there with one arm while he jerked Edward\u0027s head to the side and buried his fangs in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strangled cry rose from Edward\u0027s lips as the vampire began to drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Grigori was there. Like an avenging angel, he pulled Alexi away from Edward. With a triumphant cry, Grigori snatched up the stake and drove it through Alexi\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrible cry of anguish and rage rose in the vampire\u0027s throat. With a look of satisfaction, Grigori twisted the stake, driving it deeper, deeper. Alexi sank to his knees, his eyes growing dull. He tried to dislodge the stake, but he lacked the strength. A horrible hissing sound issued from his lips as he sank to the floor. His face turned a hideous shade of gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marisa, bring me the chain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at Grigori, one hand pressed to her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Marisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to take her eyes from the horror before her, she picked up the chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it over him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as she was told, though it seemed unnecessary. Alexi Kristov was truly dead this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marisa. Marisa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked up at him, and then fell into his arms, sobbing. \"Edward... what about Edward?\" She looked over her shoulder at Edward, who lay sprawled on the floor, a gaping hole in his throat. \"Is he...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, but soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t let him die. Please, Grigori, you\u0027ve got to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please! He saved our lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. But you will have to take the blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Please, hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish, cara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her go, and then put a hand on her shoulder. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweeping her into his arms, he carried her across the floor and placed her in the chair. Yanking the bedspread from the bed, he covered her with it. \"Rest.\" He brushed a wisp of hair from her cheek. \"You might want to close your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, but she didn\u0027t. Hands clutching the bedspread, she watched as Grigori knelt on the floor and drew Edward into his lap. With surprising gentleness, he turned Edward\u0027s head to the side. She saw Grigori take a deep breath, and then he bent down, his long black hair falling over Edward\u0027s face, blocking her view. Several long minutes passed. The ticking of the bedside clock seemed very loud in the stillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, she glanced at Alexi\u0027s body, half expecting it to vanish into thin air. She wished Grigori had thought to cover it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA movement drew her eye back to Grigori. She pressed her knuckles to her mouth as Grigori bit his own wrist, and then placed the bleeding wound to Edward\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink, Ramsey.\" His voice was soft yet compelling, as soothing as a mother\u0027s lullaby. \"That\u0027s right, drink your fill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Edward was drinking, his mouth fastened to Grigori\u0027s wrist, his hands clutching Grigori\u0027s arm as if he feared it would be suddenly snatched away. His eyes were open, his expression one of near-rapture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori turned his head, his gaze meeting Marisa\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what I am, what I have always been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Marisa met his gaze, unflinching, accepting him, loving him, for who and what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough.\" Grigori jerked his arm from Edward\u0027s grasp, ran his tongue over the wound in his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sat back, looking confused. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa leaned forward in the chair. Color suffused Edward\u0027s cheeks; the horrible wound in his throat closed, healed, in a matter of minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glanced from Chiavari to Marisa. \"What the hell happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel, Edward?\" Marisa asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel fine,\" he retorted. \"I want to know what the...\" His words trailed off when he caught sight of Alexi\u0027s body. \"Is he dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa shrugged. \"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead,\" Grigori remarked. He regarded Ramsey through narrowed eyes. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you two keep asking me that? I feel\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he frowned\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I feel funny.\" He looked at Alexi again. \"I stabbed him, and then he\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward lifted one hand to his throat. \"He bit me. Ripped my jugular. I remember... what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were dying,\" Marisa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey stared at Grigori, a look of horror spreading over his face. \"You didn\u0027t? For the love of all that\u0027s holy, tell me you didn\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my idea,\" Marisa said. \"He didn\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told him to turn me into one of them? How could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa stood up, clutching the bedspread to her chest. \"Would you rather be dead, Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambled to his feet and backed away from them both. \"Of course I would,\" he began, and then, shoulders slumping, he buried his face in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising to his feet, Grigori went to stand beside Marisa. \"Don\u0027t be sorry, cara. If he\u0027d rather be dead, I\u0027ll be only too happy to accommodate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s head snapped up. \"Yeah, I\u0027ll just bet you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your choice, vampyre hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward snorted. \"Not anymore. I guess you just put me out of business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I guess I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward lifted his hands, turned them this way and that. Crossing the floor, he stared into the mirror above the dresser. \"I look the same,\" he murmured. \"How can I look the same and feel so different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might thank Grigori,\" Marisa suggested, \"for saving your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward turned around. \"I was going to kill you, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori nodded. \"I know you were going to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward gestured at Alexi\u0027s body. \"What are we going to do with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drag his body out onto the balcony. The sun will take care of the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shuddered, and then squared his shoulders. \"Well, I guess I\u0027ll be going.\" He took a step toward Marisa, but then stopped, as if uncertain how she would receive him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa held out a hand and smiled. \"Keep in touch, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand in both of his and squeezed it. \"I will. Good night, Marisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful, Ramsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward met Grigori\u0027s eyes, surprised by the genuine concern in the other man\u0027s voice. \"You too. And... thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he be okay?\" Marisa asked when they were alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s up to him.\" He gave her shoulders a squeeze; then he dragged Kristov\u0027s body out onto the balcony, careful not to touch the chain coiled on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa was sitting on the bed when he returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori smiled at her. \"Some honeymoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can\u0027t say it hasn\u0027t been exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And are you still happy being Mrs. Chiavari?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be happier if you were holding me.\" She slid off the bed and wrapped her arms around him. \"Can we sleep in another room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, he pulled the blankets off the bed, swung her into his arms, and carried her down the hall into one of the other bedrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumping the blankets on the bed, he sat down and cradled her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a most remarkable woman,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, husband, are a most remarkable man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you still think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\" She caressed his cheek. \"Nothing will change that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think Edward will be happy being a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s up to him. Life is what you make it, cara, whether you\u0027re a man or a vampyre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Before Marisa, he had merely been content. He had accepted what he was, learned to live with it. He had made the most of the good things, and wasted little energy worrying over the drawbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head to one side, her eyes shining with love. \"So, do you think I\u0027d be happy as a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marisa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, hardly daring to believe his ears. \"You\u0027re not serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Until this moment, she hadn\u0027t realized how seriously she had been considering it, how desperately she wanted to share his life, all of it, how desperately she wanted him to share hers. There was only one way that could ever be possible. \"Would you change me if I asked you to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you were certain it was what you wanted.\" He looked deep into her eyes. How many times had he dreamed of bestowing the Dark Gift on her? A hundred? A thousand? Yet he had never suggested it, certain she would refuse. \"Is it what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but not right away. I\u0027d like to spend Easter with my family up at the cabin one more time, maybe go on vacation with Mom and Dad next summer, and spend one more Christmas with Mike and Barbara and the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori nodded. \"There\u0027s no hurry, cara. We have all the time in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the time in the world,\" she repeated softly. \"I like the sound of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Marisa, you\u0027ll never know how much you mean to me. I wish I had words enough to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed up at him, her lips parting in a sensual smile as she slid her arms around his neck. \"You could show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was his pleasure to do so, not only that night, but every night for centuries to come. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shades-of-gray-vampire-trilogy-1/page-34.html","bookId":2296,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:07 PM"}
