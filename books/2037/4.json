If you go back to animal blood, wil you be seriously weakened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan smiled. \"I\u0027l be the way I was when I first met you,\"he said. \"Strong enough to do this.\"He bent toward the fire irons right below Damon\u0027s elbow, murmuring absently, \"Scusilo per favore\" and removed the poker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon rol ed his eyes. But when Stefan, in one fluid motion, bent the poker into a shape and then straightened it immediately back and replaced it, Matt could swear that there was ice-cold envy in Damon\u0027s usual poker-player expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that was iron, which is resistant to al eldritch forces,\"Meredith said evenly, as Stefan stepped away from the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of course he\u0027s been imbibing from you three charming girls for the past few days - not to mention the nuclear powerhouse that dear Elena has become,\"Damon said, clapping his hands three times slowly. \"Oh...Mutt. Sono spiacente - I mean, I didn\u0027t mean to add you in with the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo offense meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None taken,\"Matt said through his teeth. If he could, just once, wipe that flashing, there-and-gone smile off Damon\u0027s face, he would die happy, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, the truth is that you have become a very...wil ing... donor for Dear Brother, haven\u0027t you?\"Damon added, his lips twitching slightly, as if only the strictest control kept him from smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt took two steps toward Damon. It was al he could do not to get right up in Damon\u0027s face, even though something in his brain always screamed suicide when he had thoughts like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\"he said as evenly as possible. \"I\u0027ve been donating blood to Stefan just like the girls. He\u0027s my friend, and a couple of days ago he looked like he\u0027d just gotten out of a concentration camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\"Damon murmured, as if chastened, but then he went on in even softer tones, \"My little brother has always been popular with both - wel , with ladies present, I wil say genders. Even with male kitsune; which of course is why I am in this mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt literal y saw red as if he were looking through a haze of blood at Damon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of which, what happened to Sage, Damon? He was a vampire. If we could find him, your problem would be over, right?\"Meredith asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good riposte, just as al Meredith\u0027s cool responses were. But Damon spoke with his fathomless black eyes fixed on Meredith\u0027s face. \"The less you know and say about Sage, the better. I wouldn\u0027t speak of him lightly - he has friends in low places. But to answer your question: No, I would not let Sage make me into a vampire. It would just complicate things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shinichi said good luck on finding out who he is,\"Meredith said, stil calm. \"Do you know what he meant by that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shrugged fluidly. \"What I know is my own business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spends time in the lowest and darkest of the Dark Dimensions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie burst out, \"Why did Sage go? Oh, Damon, did he go because of us? Why did he leave Talon and Saber to watch over us, then? And, oh - oh -\u0026nbsp; oh, Damon, I\u0027m so sorry! So, so sorry! \"She slid off the love seat and bent her head so that only strawberry curls were visible. With her smal pale hands on the floor to brace her, she looked as if she were about to bow her head to the ground at his feet. \"This is al my fault and everyone\u0027s angry - but it was just so horrible I had to believe the worst things I could think of!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tension-breaker. Nearly everyone laughed. It was so Bonnie, and so true of al of them. So human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt wanted to pick her up and put her back on the love seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith was always the best medicine for Bonnie. But as Matt found himself reaching for her, he was confounded by two other pairs of hands doing the same thing. One was Meredith\u0027s own long, slender olive-skinned hands, and the other pair were male, with even longer tapering fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt\u0027s hand clenched into a fist. Let Meredith take her, he thought, and his clumsy fist - somehow - got in the way of Damon\u0027s reaching fingers. Meredith lifted Bonnie easily and sat back on the love seat. Damon lifted his dark eyes to Matt\u0027s and Matt saw perfect comprehension there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You real y ought to forgive her, Damon,\"Meredith, ever the impartial referee, said bluntly. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027l be able to sleep tonight otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shrugged, cold as an iceberg. \"Maybe...someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt could feel his muscles clench. What kind of bastard said that to little Bonnie? Because of course she was listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you,\"Matt said under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"Damon\u0027s voice was no longer languid and falsely polite, but suddenly a whiplash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me,\"Matt growled. \"And if you didn\u0027t, maybe we\u0027d better go outside so I can say it louder,\"he added, soaring on the wings of bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left behind a wail of \"No!\"from Bonnie, and a gentle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh,\"from Meredith. Stefan said, \"Both of you - \"in a commanding voice, but then he faltered and coughed, which both Matt and Damon took as a chance to sprint for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was stil very warm outside on the boardinghouse porch. \"Is this the kil ing ground?\"Damon asked lazily when they had descended the steps and stood beside the gravel path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine by me,\"Matt said briefly, knowing in his bones that Damon would fight dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, this is definitely close enough,\"Damon said, flashing an unnecessarily bril iant smile in Matt\u0027s direction. \"You can yel for help while little brother is in the parlor, and he\u0027l have plenty of time to rescue you. And now we\u0027re going to solve the problems of what you\u0027re doing in my business and why you are - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt punched him in the nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what Damon was trying to do. If you asked a guy to step outside, then you asked him to step outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you went for the guy. You didn\u0027t stand around talking. If you tried that, you\u0027d be stuck with the label of \"coward\"or worse. Damon didn\u0027t seem like the type who needed to be told that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, Damon had always been able to repel any attack on him while he got as many insults as he liked...before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, he\u0027d have just broken every bone in my hand and gone on baiting me, Matt guessed. But now...I\u0027m almost as fast as him, and he simply got taken by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt flexed his hand gingerly. It always hurt, of course, but if Meredith could do it to Caroline, then he could do it to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, did I just take down Damon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun, Honeycutt, he seemed to hear the voice of his old coach tel ing him. Run. Get out of town. Change your name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTried that. Didn\u0027t work. Never even got a T-shirt, Matt thought sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Damon wasn\u0027t leaping up like a flaming demon from hel , with the eyes of a dragon and the strength of a raging bul to annihilate Matt. It looked and sounded more as if he were shocked and indignant from his disheveled hair to his earth-stained boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You...ignorant...childish...\"He lapsed into Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\"Matt said. \"I\u0027m here to fight, okay? And the smartest guy I ever knew said: \u0027If you\u0027re gonna fight, don\u0027t talk. If you\u0027re gonna talk, don\u0027t fight.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon tried to snarl as he knelt up and pul ed spiny teasel and prickly sida out of his distressed black jeans. But the snarl didn\u0027t come out quite right. Maybe it was the new shape of his canines. Maybe it just didn\u0027t have enough conviction behind it. Matt had seen enough defeated guys to know that this fight was over. A strange exaltation came over him. He was going to keep al his limbs and organs! It was a precious, precious moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl right, then, should I offer him a hand? Matt wondered, to be answered instantaneously by, Sure, if you\u0027d offer a hand to a temporarily stunned crocodile. What do you really need ten whole fingers for, anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, wel , he thought, turning to go back into the front door. As long as he lived - which, conceded, might not be too long - he would remember this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he went in, he bumped into Bonnie, who was rushing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Matt, oh, Matt,\"she cried. She was looking wildly around. \"Did you hurt him? Did he hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt smacked his fist into the palm of his hand, once. \"He\u0027s stil sitting down back there,\"he added helpful y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\"Bonnie gasped, and she hurried out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Less spectacular of a night. But stil a pretty good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did what?\"Elena asked Stefan. Cold poultices anchored by tight bandages were wrapped around her arm, hand, and thigh - Mrs. Flowers had cut her jeans off short - and Mrs. Flowers was wiping away the dried blood on her neck with herbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was pounding with more than pain. Even she hadn\u0027t realized that Stefan was tuned in to the entire house when he was awake. Al she could do was to shakily thank God that he\u0027d been asleep while she and Damon - no! She had to stop thinking about it, and right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They went outside to fight,\"Stefan said. \"It\u0027s idiotic, of course. But it\u0027s a matter of honor, too. I can\u0027t interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel , I can - if you\u0027re done, Mrs. Flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, dear Elena,\"Mrs. Flowers said, winding a bandage around Elena\u0027s throat. \"Now you shouldn\u0027t get tetanus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena stopped in mid-motion. \"I thought you got tetanus from rusty blades,\"she said. \"Da - this one looked brand-new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tetanus comes from dirty blades, my dear,\"Mrs. Flowers corrected her. \"But this\" - she held up a bottle - \"is Grand mama\u0027s own personal recipe that has kept many a wound disease-free down the cen - down the years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\"Elena said. \"I never even heard of Grand mama before. Was she a - healer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\"Mrs. Flowers said earnestly. \"She was actual y accused of being a witch. But at her trial they could prove nothing. Her accusers seemed not even to be capable of coherent speech.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena looked at Stefan only to find that he was looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt was in danger of being dragged off to a kangaroo court - for al egedly assaulting Caroline Forbes while under the influence of some unknown and terrible drug. Anything to do with courts was interesting to both of them. But looking at Stefan\u0027s concerned face, Elena decided not to pursue the subject. She squeezed his hand. \"We have to go now - but let\u0027s talk about Grand mama later. I think she sounds fascinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just remember her as a crotchety old recluse, who didn\u0027t suffer fools gladly and thought just about everyone was a fool,\"Mrs. Flowers said. \"I suppose I was going down the same path until you children came and made me sit up and take notice. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re the ones who should thank you,\"Elena began, hugging the old woman, feeling her heart stop pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan was looking at her with open love. It was al going to be al right - for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m worried about Matt, she thought to Stefan, testing the waters more vigorously. Damon\u0027s still so fast - and you know he doesn\u0027t like Matt a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think, Stefan returned with a wry smile, that that is a rather stunning understatement. But I also think you shouldn\u0027t worry until we see who comes back injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena eyed that smile, and thought for a moment about impulsive, athletic Matt. After a moment, she smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was feeling both guilty and protective - and safe. Stefan always made her feel safe. And right now, she wanted to spoil him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the front yard, Bonnie was abasing herself. She couldn\u0027t help thinking, even now, about how handsome Damon looked, how wild and dark and ferocious and gorgeous. She couldn\u0027t help thinking about the times he\u0027d smiled at her, laughed at her, come to save her at her urgent cal . She had honestly thought that someday...But now she felt as if her heart were breaking in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to bite my tongue out,\"she said. \"I should never have assumed anything from what I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you possibly have known that I wasn\u0027t stealing Elena away from Stefan?\"Damon said wearily. \"It\u0027s just the kind of thing I\u0027d do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t! You did so much to free Stefan from prison - you always faced the most danger yourself - and you kept us al from being hurt. You did al that for other people - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Bonnie\u0027s upper arms were being held by hands that were so strong that her mind was flooded with cliches. A grasp of iron. Strong as steel bands. An inescapable grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a voice like an icy torrent was coming at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know anything about me, or what I want, or what I do. For al you know I could be plotting right now. So don\u0027t ever let me hear you talk again about such things, or imagine that I won\u0027t kil you if you get in my way,\"Damon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and left Bonnie sitting there, staring after him. And she\u0027d been wrong. She wasn\u0027t out of tears at al .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-midnight-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-4.html","bookId":2037,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:32:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:32:33 PM"}
