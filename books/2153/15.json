He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hawat will be given both food and drink,\" the Baron said. \"Treated with kindness, with sympathy.

True, but the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he\u0027s not to blame for the Duke\u0027s demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud . We will woo the formidable Thufir Hawat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woo him. Yes, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat\u0027s right. Hawat will see a certain element of truth in this. The Duke couldn\u0027t afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information.\" The Baron stared at Nefud . \"Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud . The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With wealth. Yes, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will woo Hawat,\" the Baron said. \"We will hide him from the Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve . . . the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison. There\u0027s no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud , Hawat need never suspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNefud \u0027s eyes opened wide with understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The absence of a thing,\" the Baron said, \"this can be as deadly as the presence .

The absence of anything else we\u0027re addicted to.\" The Baron nodded. \"You understand me, Nefud ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNefud swallowed. \"Yes, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At once, m\u0027Lord.\" Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If they suspect anything at all it\u0027s that I wish to destroy the Mentat. And this suspicion I\u0027ll confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they\u0027ll toss him to me like some silly toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the Atreides dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter . . . or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet . . . all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor\u0027s ears alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower and fear - fear and power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this Rabban he\u0027d summoned, of course. But Rabban\u0027s younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed . . . a ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lovely boy , the Baron thought. A year or two more - say, by the time he\u0027s seventeen, I\u0027ll know for certain whether he\u0027s the tool that House Harkonnen requires to gain the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M\u0027Lord Baron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron\u0027s bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line\u0027s narrow-set eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some rigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that he\u0027d come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle-minded tank-brain , the Baron thought. No Mentat, my nephew . . . not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he\u0027ll grind over everything in his path. Oh, how he\u0027ll be hated here on Arrakis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Rabban,\" the Baron said. He released the doorfield, but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You summoned me,\" Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a suspensor chair, found none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand closer where I can see you easily,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Atreides are dead,\" the Baron said. \"The last of them. That\u0027s why I summoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban blinked. \"But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piter, too, is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You finally tired of him, eh?\" Rabban asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy-blanketed room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will say a thing to you just this once,\" the Baron rumbled. \"You insinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle.\" He snapped fat fingers. \"Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. I will take it unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that I am so stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear showed in the squinting of Rabban\u0027s eyes. He knew within certain limits how far the old Baron would go against family. Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments could be painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, m\u0027Lord Baron,\" Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not fool me, Rabban,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I make a point,\" the Baron said. \"Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law . Always do it for an overriding purpose - and know your purpose! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger spoke in Rabban: \"But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his body being carried out as I arrived last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Baron smiled. \"I\u0027m very careful about dangerous weapons,\" he said. \"Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke.\" Strength poured into the Baron\u0027s voice. \"I suborned a doctor of the Suk School ! The Inner School ! You hear, boy? But that\u0027s a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. I didn\u0027t obliterate him casually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a penetrating question , the Baron thought. Have I misjudged this nephew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Emperor doesn\u0027t know it yet,\" the Baron said. \"But his Sardaukar are sure to report it to him. Before that happens, though, I\u0027ll have my own report in his hands through CHOAM Company channels. I will explain that I luckily discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you understand? Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk School , this will be accepted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-h-h, I see,\" Rabban murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Baron thought: Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret . The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. Why did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine - the nephew I must use and discard? The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be kept secret,\" Rabban said. \"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron sighed. \"I give you different instructions about Arrakis this time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein. This time, I have only one requirement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M\u0027Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Income.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Income?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Expensive, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Expensive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. \"If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, you\u0027ll just barely repay us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Expensive,\" the Baron sneered. \"The damnable Guild monopoly on space would\u0027ve ruined us if I hadn\u0027t planned for this expense long ago. You should know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were insidious - bleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and pay and pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. \"Hazard rates,\" the oily Guild agents explained. And for every agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsufferable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Income then,\" Rabban said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. \"You must squeeze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cannons you brought,\" Rabban said. \"Could I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m removing them,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t need such toys.

I . . . ah, took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from . . . ah, before. They\u0027ve been acting as guides to the Sardaukar.

Have you any idea how displeased I\u0027d be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor,\" the Baron said. \"As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was straightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though. That is the story.

Not the slightest vestige of pity or mercy must you show them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can one exterminate an entire planet?\" Rabban asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exterminate?\" Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron\u0027s head. \"Who said anything about exterminating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said squeeze . Nephew, not exterminate. Don\u0027t waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy.\" He smiled, a baby\u0027s expression in the dimple-fat face. \"A carnivore never stops. Show no mercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry and thirsty.\" The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. \"Like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban swung his gaze left and right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all clear then, Nephew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except for one thing.

His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. \"Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis.

I\u0027ve quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Duke\u0027s men got most of what we\u0027d stored for sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRabban nodded. \"Yes, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron brightened. \"Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains of organization here and you\u0027ll say to them: \u0027Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time, I\u0027m sure you do.

Muscle-minded tank-brain. They will be bloody pulp here when he\u0027s through with them. Then, when I send in Feyd-Rautha to take the load off them, they\u0027ll cheer their rescuer. Beloved Feyd-Rautha. Benign Feyd-Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from a beast. Feyd-Rautha, a man to follow and die for. The boy will know by that time how to oppress with impunity. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s the one we need. He\u0027ll learn. And such a lovely body. Really a lovely boy .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"A Child\u0027s History of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Paul fought the \u0027thopter\u0027s controls, he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional vortex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his inner sense began to see through the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must find the right vortex , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time now he had sensed the storm\u0027s power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the \u0027thopter left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul!\" she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the \u0027thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out - a winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert - moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re out of it,\" Jessica whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve given them the slip,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the litany , she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It\u0027s gone, but we remain .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the sound of our wing motion,\" Paul said. \"We suffered some damage in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was the spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the words had a power of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall not fear . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the litany\u0027s magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: \"What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s rock all around,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul focused on the \u0027thopter\u0027s launching, shook his head to clear it. He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm\u0027s doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better set us down on sand,\" Jessica said. \"The wings might not take full brake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes. \"I\u0027ll set us down near those rocks. Check your safety harness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obeyed, thinking: We\u0027ve water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we can do .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run for those rocks the instant we\u0027re stopped,\" Paul said. \"I\u0027ll take the pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run for . . . \" She fell silent, nodded. \" Worms .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our friends, the worms,\" he corrected her. \"They\u0027ll get this \u0027thopter.

The \u0027thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s killing our speed against the sand , Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brace yourself!\" Paul warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder. He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings\u0027 leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the \u0027thopter. The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and out onto the \u0027thopter\u0027s metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its straps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run!\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica leaped off the \u0027thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune. She heard Paul\u0027s panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow the ridge,\" Paul ordered. \"It\u0027ll be faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worm,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grew louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faster!\" Paul gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother\u0027s arm with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t run any farther,\" Jessica panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel to their rock island\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- moonlit ripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul\u0027s eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once - a short loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bigger than a Guild spaceship,\" Paul whispered. \"I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but I didn\u0027t realize . . . how big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor I,\" Jessica breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving track toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and quoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: \"Travel by night and rest in black shade through the day.\" He looked at his mother. \"We still have a few hours of night. Can you go on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever you\u0027re ready,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. \"Which direction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where this ridge leads.\" He pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deep into the desert,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fremen desert,\" Paul whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But the set of the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-15.html","bookId":2153,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:41 PM"}
