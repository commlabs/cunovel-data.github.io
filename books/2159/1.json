But this, the crystalline glimmer of a single silken strand, shone brightly, caught her eye, and showed her all that it was and all that would soon be, and all that she was and all that she would soon be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glimmer of light in the dark Abyss promised renewal and greater glory and made that promise all the sweeter with its hints of danger, mortal danger for a creature immortal by nature. That, too, was the allure, was, in truth, the greatest joy of the growth. The mother of chaos was fear, not evil, and the enjoyment of chaos was the continual fear of the unknown, the shifting foundation of everything, the knowledge that every twist and turn could lead to disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something the drow had never come to fully understand and appreciate, and she preferred that ignorance. To the drow, the chaos was a means for personal gain; there were no straight ladders in the tumult of drow life for one to climb. But the beauty was not the ascent, she knew, if they did not.

She wished she could remain more fully conscious to witness it all, to bask in it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter. Even within, she would feel the pleasure of their fear, the hunger of their ambition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat glimmer of the silk edge, cutting the gray perpetual fog of the swirling plane, brought a singular purpose to this creature of shifting whims and reminded her that it was time, was past time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever taking her gaze off that glimmer, the creature turned slowly, winding herself in the single strand. The first strand of millions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe start of the metamorphosis, the promise. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-1.html","bookId":2159,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:59 PM"}
