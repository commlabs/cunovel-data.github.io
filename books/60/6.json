{"id":1860,"no":6,"title":"A Patch-Work SCREEN FOR THE LADIES. LEAF IV.","content":"The Ladies having pass\u0027d their Evening\u0027s Diversion, and their Night\u0027s Repose, dispos\u0027d themselves in the Morning to go on with their Patch-work; the Lady ordering Galesia to resume her Story. Which she was about to do, when the Cook came to inquire, what shou\u0027d be for Dinner; telling her Ladyship, That Two of the South-Sea Directors had sent his Master Word they wou\u0027d dine with him to Day. They think themselves Great-Men, said the Lady, that they did not suppose we had a Dinner worth their eating, without sending us Word. But since they have taken Care to give us this Notice, we will do the best we can; therefore, if you can tell my Cook how to make a very good French Soup, prithee do.\n\u003cbr\u003e A Receipt for French Soup.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Take a large Barn-door Cock, and all his Bones break;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of Mutton and Veal, each one a good Neck: may make;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of these, then, Two Quarts of strong Broth you take;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Next, another full Quart of good Beef Gravey\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of right Vermicelli, a Quartern at least:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then season all these as best likes your Taste:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Fowl in the Middle, to swim like a Toast,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It matters not whether it boil\u0027d be or roast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With Bacon and Balls, then garnish it well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Add Toasts fry\u0027d in Marrow, and Sweet-breads of Veal,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And what else you please: for I cannot tell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is a chargeable Soup, said the Lady, but one wou\u0027d not stick at Expence to obtain the Favour of one of these Directors. My Husband is about to lay a Debt upon his Estate, to put into this profitable Fund: He has, with much ado, got the Promise of a Subscription for 10,000l. for this Purpose. Madam, reply\u0027d Galesia, I beg you to use your utmost Endeavours to prevent this Proceeding: I beg you for God\u0027s Sake, your own Sake, your Childrens Sake, and for the Sake of all the Poor, that depend upon your Charity, to endeavour to disappoint this Design. I know not what to say (reply\u0027d the Lady) to these your earnest Entreaties; but for the Sake of this your Solicitation, I shall consider very well upon it, together with my Husband. And now we are alone and quiet, turn over your Papers, and look out some Patches. Accordingly Galesia went about it, and, lo! the first thing she laid her Fingers upon, was a Prophesy, which she read, after the Lady had discharg\u0027d her Cook with due Orders about the Dinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Prophesy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When a Noise in the South\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ???Shall fill ev\u0027ry one\u0027s Mouth,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then England beware of Undoing,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ???Your Sins shall be scourged,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ???Your Pockets well purged,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And, ev\u0027ry one seek his own Ruin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I suppose, said the Lady, this Prophesy gives you so great an Aversion to the South-Sea. I cannot deny, said Galesia, but it strikes my Thoughts so far, that if I had never so much to spare, I wou\u0027d not put a Shilling into that or any other Bubble. I will not inquire into your Reasons, said the Lady; it will but hinder our Diversion: So pray go on with your Story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas! said Galesia, the next is so melancholy, that I care not how long I keep from it; for now it was that the Death of King Charles II. put a Stop to the Wheel of all Joy and Happiness in England: And it more particularly affected me, because the Death of this our Gracious Sovereign, seiz\u0027d my dear aged Mother with such a Storm of Grief, that she fell into a languishing State, in which she continu\u0027d for many Weeks, e\u0027er Death releas\u0027d her. During her Illness, whilst I watch\u0027d her Slumbers, divers Reflexions accosted me, some of one kind, some of another; in particular, What a new Face the World had at present: It was but t\u0027other Day, said I to myself, that all the World was in Gaiety, and the English-Court in Splendor. The King reverenc\u0027d; the Courtiers belov\u0027d; the Nation seeking after them for Places and Preferments: Glittering Coaches crowding before White-hall-Gate, discharging out of their sides Beaus and Belles, in the most sumptuous Apparel, as if they meant to vie with Phoebus in his Meridian. And now, behold how wonderful is the Change! as if Dooms-day had discharg\u0027d it self of a Shower of black walking Animals; whose Cheeks are bedew\u0027d with Tears, and whose Breasts are swollen with Sighs! Amongst these, none griev\u0027d more sincerely than my Mother, for the Death of this her Royal Lord, for whose dear Sake, and that of his Father, so many Heroes of her Family had shed their dearest Blood. Then wou\u0027d she remark upon, and recite the Villainies of those Times, \u0027till Faintness call\u0027d her Spirits to some reviving Slumbers. In the mean time my Pen wou\u0027d discharge itself of one sort of Scribble or other; and I think here is one appears:\n\u003cbr\u003e On the Follies of Human-Life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To trace but out the Follies of Mankind,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whether in the Common-Mass, or else disjoyn\u0027d,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is an Abyss, wherein to drown the Mind:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Lab\u0027rinth wild, obscure, to lose one\u0027s Sense,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Wilderness of thick Impertinence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tho\u0027 we pretend we\u0027ave Reason for our Guide,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Passions get the Reins, they drive aside,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027er dang\u0027rous Ways, and Precipices run,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Till Reason is by Passion overthrown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ???No Animals such Bubbles are, as Man;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They strive to save themselves, in all they can;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But we in our own Snares, our selves trapan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027re Heav\u0027n\u0027s Clock-work, too, too finely wrought,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seldom strike true, in Deed, in Word or Thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But clash and clatter, contradict and prove,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then say and unsay, as our Fancies move.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sometimes we glory of Immortal Souls,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whilst every Action, every Word controuls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Above all Sense, we of our Reason boast,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whilst by our Deeds, we shou\u0027d think both were lost,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some, with Respect to God, their Words will place,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whilst some again, his Entity disgrace,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And All, in Deeds, affront him to his Face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then to excuse ourselves of all these Crimes,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We lay the Fault on Devils or the Times.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When false Ideas, our frail Minds persuade,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Lust or other Crimes our Wills invade,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Devils are aspers\u0027d, and Panders made.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Tis true, e\u0027er since the Fall, we are his Fools,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He plots our Ruin, and make us his Tools.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For oft\u0027ner we betray ourselves than he\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e (Deforming th\u0027 Image of the Deity);\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so make Brutes, much happier than we.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ???Than \u0027tis not strange, if we this Being hate,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ???Since brutal Happiness is more compleat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a little Reflection, recollecting my scatter\u0027d Thoughts, I broke out into the following Contemplations:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whither, O whither! do my Thoughts ramble! — Into what strange, unfrequented Desarts does my Imagination wander! — Desarts, never trodden but by one Wild Passenger. He, indeed, has told the World of one Fowler, a Happy Creature. But I dare ingage, if it were in Fowler\u0027s Power, he would most readily change with the most contemptible of Human Creatures, (setting a happy Immortality aside). I have heard say, That a Butcher\u0027s Dog, and a Brewer\u0027s Hog, are the Happiest of Brute Animals: But which of us wou\u0027d change with either of them, if Transmigration were in our Power? Not one I dare answer; no, not even of those who daily make themselves in Fact, what those Animals are in Form; and by their repeated Excesses, become of so deprav\u0027d a Nature, that they are scarce distinguishable (at least in their Actions) from those poor Brutes. And tho\u0027 these are Vices which all the World explode in Words, yet very few do in Acts. And what is more detestable, (if true) I have heard that our Women begin to be Practitioners in this Vice; which is but lately, if at all; for \u0027till now, their Manners never suffer\u0027d the least Blemish of that kind, but were as perfect, as to any such Taint, as an untouch\u0027d Plumb, or Grape, in a fair Summer\u0027s Morning; Pride having been the only Vice imputed to the Fair Sex. And indeed at some Times, and on some Occasions, is so far from being a Vice, that it is a Vertue of great Magnitude, shining in the Horizon of their Affairs. However, I dare ingage, there is not one of either Sex wou\u0027d injoy the utmost Pleasures, attending the Perpetration of these Crimes, at the Price of their Humanity.\n\u003cbr\u003e And as to Pride,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Crime most laid at the Ladies Door; \u0027Tis said, they love Dressing, gaudy Apparel, Preference of Place, Title, Equipage, \u0026amp;c. But which of them wou\u0027d be a Peacock for the sake of his Plumes? a Lark for its high flying? or an Owl for the sake of the great Equipage of Birds that fly after him? Alas! not one. The meanest Servant in a Family, wou\u0027d not change her Station, to be the Happiest of these Animals. Then let us value our Humanity, and endeavour to imbellish it with vertuous Actions; by which means we shall be far from seting our-selves on the Level with mere Animals, much less giving them the Preference. But e\u0027er I leave this Reflection on Pride, we must remember, That there is a great Difference between the Use and Abuse of those Things, which seem the Concomitants of Pride; for Cloaths, Place, Equipage, \u0026amp;c. in some Cases, and to some Persons, are Necessaries almost to a Necessity; as the Gospel testifies, Soft Rayment is for King\u0027s Houses: For God is pleas\u0027d to place different Persons in different Stations; and every one is to accommodate themselves according to their Station; it wou\u0027d as ill befit a Hedger to wear a Velvet Coat, as a Courtier to wear a Leathern one; for if over-doing our Condition, may ascend to Pride, under-doing may descend to Sloth or Slovenliness: Therefore, with Care, we are to chuse the Medium. I doubt not but Diogenes was as proud in his Tub, as Alexander in his Palace. To find a right Medium, is sometimes hard; for very often Vice dresses her self in the Apparel of Vertue; and, in a special manner, Pride puts on the Mask of Honour: And though one be a direct Vice, and the other a Vertue, yet they are not distinguishable to every Capacity, but often one passes for the other. Lucifer, the Author of this Sin, having taken Care to gild it over double and treble, with the refulgent Brightness of Honour, Magnanimity, and Generosity: Which so dazles our Interiour, that we are not always able to distinguish between the Crime of this Apostate Angel, and the Vertue of Seraphims; the one by his Pride having thrown himself into utter Darkness, and eternal Misery; the other, by their Obedience, maintaining their Seraphick Glory in the highest Heavens. By mistaking these, we often deprive ourselves of the Benefit of our well-form\u0027d Intentions. Again, sometimes, the beauteous Face of Vertue presents her-self in an obscure Light, without the Sun-shine of happy Circumstances. We then let her pass unregarded, and so lose the Opportunity of making our-selves happy in her Embraces. Which puts me in mind of a Distich or two.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If Chance or Fore-cast, some small Good produce,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We slip it by unknown, or spoil it in the Use.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When many Years in Toils and Cares are pass\u0027d,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To get of Happiness some small Repast,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our Crimes or Follies always spoil the Taste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now these Oversights and Mistakes, are not only in the Case of Pride and its opposite Vertues; but in other Cases, a false Light or a false Appearance deceives us; we mistake Cunning for Wisdom, and a mean Selfishness, for a discreet Precaution; Fury and Rashness for Valour; Vain-glory for Charity; and a thousand Things of the like Nature. But having mention\u0027d Charity, here appears a little Slip of Verse; which, I think, refers rather to the forgiving, than the giving Part of Charity. However it will make a Patch.\n\u003cbr\u003e Upon CHARITY.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This Vertue does above all others climb;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To give is Noble, to forgive Sublime.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giving, one may call Religion\u0027s Heart;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Pardoning, the Animating Part.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These Two conjoyn\u0027d, make Charity complete,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By which our Souls of Heav\u0027n participate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Vertue kind, soft, gentle, debonair,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Guardian Angels to their Pupils are,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or faithful Swains, to their lov\u0027d, faithful-Fair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To chast Affection, \u0027tis as Oyl to Fire,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Ice and Water to all foul Desire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of Friendship and fraternal Love the Source,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Marriage Vows, it waters with its Course;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Like Aqua-fortis, graving on the Mind,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Character of all good Deeds and kind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But otherwise it does a Lethe prove,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And makes us quite forget forgiving Love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These Blessings are th\u0027 Effects of Charity;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But nought compar\u0027d to Heav\u0027n\u0027s unbounded Joy,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Surpassing Sense! which those participate,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who shar\u0027d this Virtue in their Earthly State.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joys! not only surpassing Sense! but too high for Humane Thought! O the transcendant Joys of a bless\u0027d Eternity! How inconceivable to our weak Capacities, are the ineffable Pleasures of the bright Regions of Eternity! Eternity of Time, and Infinity of Space, who can comprehend? Reason can climb high, and Thought can extend far; but neither Reason nor Thought can reach the Altitude of Heaven, nor the Extent of the Almighty\u0027s Dominions: To say nothing of His Justice, Mercy and Wisdom, and His Power to execute whatsoever His Wisdom determines from and to all Eternity: Where the Righteous injoy all Happiness, and the Wicked all Misery. All this we risque, for a little Shining Earth, or, what is less worthy, a little empty Fame; the one being the Aim of the Covetous, the other of the Ambitious Man; of which the latter is the worst, because his Vice affects whole Countries and Kingdoms; whereof we have but too pregnant an Example at this Time, in the Person of the Duke of Monmouth. Unhappy Young Prince! to be possess\u0027d with this Devil of Ambition, which makes him become the Phaeton of our Age; to set these Kingdoms in a Combustion. [For it was at this Time, Madam, added Galesia, that the Duke of Monmouth\u0027s Enterprize began to be talk\u0027d of.] Whether Ambition be a Branch of Pride, or Pride a Branch of Ambition, I know not: They both partake of the same Quality; so which is Root, or which is Branch, it matters not; since it may be determin\u0027d, that the Tree produces the worst of Fruit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As I was going on in these wandring Thoughts, during the Intervals of my grieved Mother\u0027s Slumbers, I heard a little mumbling Noise in the next House, in a Room joyning to ours; which mumbling at last ended in a Hymn: Then I concluded it to be the Prayer of an Old Gentlewoman who lodg\u0027d on the same Floor in the next House. But the Hymn being distinct, I cou\u0027d hear the Words perfectly; which are these:\n\u003cbr\u003e A Hymn. Sung in a Psalm Tune.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Preserve thy Holy Servant Monmouth, Lord,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who carries for his Shield thy Sacred Word:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Preserve him from the Lyon and the Bear:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From Foxes and from Wolves, who daily tear\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thy little Flock: and for him whet thy Sword,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That we may be Thy People, Thou our Lord.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do thou the Red-Coats to Confusion bring,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Surplices, Lawn-Sleeves, and eke their King;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whilst in thy Sion we thy Praises sing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wicked Song! said I; and wicked Wretch that sings it; in which she curses the Lord\u0027s Anointed, and all his Adherents, the Church and all her Children.
