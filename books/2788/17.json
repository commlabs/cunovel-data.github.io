I went downstairs and started cleaning. Some people eat in times of stress. I scour. By the time Dody and Fontaine were up, I\u0027d cleaned the bathrooms, scrubbed the kitchen floor, and was taking down the family-room curtains for washing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, sunshine,\" Dody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust wafted off the drapes, making me sneeze. \"When\u0027s the last time you washed these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you could. Won\u0027t the hooks get caught in the machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hooks come off. Are you telling me these have never been cleaned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can\u0027t tell, then why does it matter? You\u0027re ornery this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip. \"Sorry. Just missing the kids, I guess.\" I had no intention of filling her in about last night\u0027s discovery. She\u0027d just say, \"Oh, pish-posh. Have some flaxseed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine wisely held his tongue, keeping busy with design sketches until he left to meet a client. We didn\u0027t even have coffee on the deck, not that I worried about seeing Des jog by. Certainly he was still entangled in the arms of the blonde and too exhausted from his horizontal cardio workout to go running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the day polishing everything I could get my hands on. And every second of every minute, I reminded myself I didn\u0027t care. It didn\u0027t matter that he didn\u0027t even call to tell me more lies. I could get over this. Broken hearts mend. At least Richard taught me that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my kids came home late the next evening, I was overjoyed. I hugged and kissed them until Jordan said, \"No more smooches, Mommy. You\u0027re hurting my face.\" Tucking Paige into bed that night, I read all her favorite stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I tell you a story, Mommy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled down under her covers. \"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed me the pictures from Snow White, adapting it to her own fractured fairy tale. Basically Snow White and the Dorfs owned a very successful cookie company, but when Prince Charming showed up, Snow White had to decide if she\u0027d quit her job and marry him or keep working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But can\u0027t she keep her job and still get married?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, silly, because when you get married, your job is taking care of the Prince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got hot all over. \"That\u0027s Daddy\u0027s opinion, honey. But Mommy doesn\u0027t agree with him. When you get bigger, then you can decide for yourself if you want to do both. It\u0027s your choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to marry Des,\" she sighed. My skin burned hotter still. \"Or maybe Fontaine. And you. Can I marry you, Mommy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. She was so sweet, so innocent. I would not ruin that for all the money in the world. \"Sure you can, baby. I would love to marry you. Now go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned off her light and went to my own room. I didn\u0027t go back downstairs. I was avoiding Dody and her inevitable questions about Des\u0027s whereabouts. I hadn\u0027t called Penny to fill her in either. It almost felt like if I didn\u0027t tell anyone, then it hadn\u0027t really happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was gorgeous outside the next morning, which made me grumpy. The kids were dying to go to the beach, but I was stalling, wanting to make sure we\u0027d miss Des\u0027s jog. This was getting a little ridiculous, though. If I was going to keep avoiding him, I might as well go back to Glenville right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you take them down to the beach, Dody? I had a little too much sun yesterday, and I think I might need to stay in today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, darling. You can\u0027t be too careful about the sun. Anita Parker has a very suspicious mole on her inner thigh. I keep meaning to ask Des to look at it. When you talk to him, will you mention it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, sure. That would be the very first thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to remember, Dody. But she should talk to her own doctor. We can\u0027t bother him with stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I suppose. All right, kiddos! Shall we go to the beach and look for seahorse shoes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seahorses don\u0027t wear shoes, Aunt Dody,\" Paige answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the summer. In the summer they wear sandals. Come on. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moseyed on down the deck steps, and I breathed a tiny sigh of relief. Another potential run-in with my one-night stand averted. I settled down on the sunporch with a magazine and my favorite coffee mug, prepared to caffeinate and brood. I derived a perverse joy in my self-pity, perhaps because it was so familiar to me. But my joy was interrupted by footsteps on the deck and that hypnotic accent I had yet to purge from my memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the shadow cast on the sunporch floor, I knew Des was standing at the screen door. I didn\u0027t look up. Why should I? I had my magazine with Alex O\u0027Loughlin\u0027s baby blues to gaze into. I didn\u0027t need Des. Stupid old Des with his stupid flat stomach and his stupid awesome hair. Stupid accent too. It probably wasn\u0027t even real. Didn\u0027t I see somebody who looked like him on America\u0027s Most Wanted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Sadie?\" He knocked lightly, then opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it. Pretty much had to acknowledge him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my eyes flicker over him. \"Oh, hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi. Dody said you were up here. Too much sun, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged noncommittally. \"Yep, I guess.\" I flipped the page of the magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. So are we on for dinner tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tsk-tsk-tsked. \"Uh, was that tonight? Shoot. I won\u0027t be able to make that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed his arms and frowned. I could almost envision the thought bubble above his head saying, \"This woman is pissed. I don\u0027t know why. The next thing I choose to say is critically important. Danger! Danger!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can read a lot into one little frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept waiting for some snarky comment or some excuse about the other night. Like his cousin Charlie was a beautiful teenage drag queen. But he was silent, staring and sucking all the oxygen out of my universe. It took every muscle in my body not to squirm. I casually flipped another page. Good-bye, picture of Robert Downey Jr. Hello, millionth depiction of the Jolie-Pitt clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie,\" he said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, was he still here? I had forgotten all about him. I looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I had to cancel the other night. Is that what this is about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the record, it did occur to me that I was being outrageously childish, but I couldn\u0027t help myself. I wanted to have a tantrum. I wanted to kick him in the shins and punch his arms. (His thick...muscular...arms...damn it!) But I wouldn\u0027t give him the satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just have a lot going on right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes dropped to my magazine. \"I can see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed it aside, lurching up from my chair with the grace of a pregnant rhinoceros. \"Look, I don\u0027t appreciate being lied to. It wasn\u0027t necessary for you to make something up. You could have told me the truth. So let\u0027s just skip the whole friend thing, OK? Thanks for your help with Dody, but we don\u0027t need you anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhew! There! I told him. He was a player, but he hadn\u0027t tricked me, god damn it, because I was too smart! Any second now a surge of indignant righteousness would course through me! Any second now...Wait for it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he was good. I had to grant him that. He had the look of a man genuinely confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cousin Charlie? I saw that little blondey-blonde cheerleader at your house, and that was no Cousin Charlie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened. \"That\u0027s what this is about? My cousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right, your cousin.\" My air quotes added just the right touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe expelled a gusty breath and stared at me a moment. Surely he was searching his big, fat head for a plausible excuse. \"Wow, Sadie,\" he finally said. \"I don\u0027t even know how to respond to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about \u0027Hasta la vista, baby?\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the \u0027blondey blonde is my cousin. Charlie.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie? Charlie is a girl?\" Hmmmmmm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! She got stranded at the airport flying home from Marquette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was kind of insistent. I felt the stirrings of uncertainty but hammered them down stubbornly. He was using typical man tactics, damn it! First they make you think you\u0027re being irrational so you start second-guessing yourself, and then somehow it turns into a fight about how you accidentally dumped a big glass of iced tea all over the keyboard when you thought he was surfing for Internet porn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m supposed to buy that? I saw her, Des.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On your deck. Fontaine and I were walking the dogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you come up and say hi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I didn\u0027t think she was your cousin. Who the hell names a girl like that Charlie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe volleyed back defensively. \"You have a cousin named Fontaine!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHo, ho, hold on! I wasn\u0027t tripped up by that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but Fontaine isn\u0027t his real name. I mean, it is his real name, but it\u0027s not his first name. It\u0027s his middle name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHah! So there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes paused. His face had the same expression Lazyboy gets when perplexed by something squeaky. \"Then what\u0027s his first name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tim!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHah! Take that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his temples. \"His name is Tim, but he goes by Fontaine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gay! Hello!\" Stop trying to change the subject, dumb-ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie for Charlotte. Hello!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a dirty trick, using my own sarcasm against me. But I had too much experience fighting with Richard to let Des get away with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why didn\u0027t you tell me that your cousin was a girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t realize I hadn\u0027t. And because it never occurred to me you\u0027d see her and completely flip out. God, Sadie. What is the matter with you?\" He ran both hands through his hair, clutching fistfuls at the top. \"You thought I cancelled on you so I could be with somebody else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood my ground, hands on my hips. \"You have every right to be with somebody else. We\u0027re not exclusive. I just don\u0027t like being lied to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed against his skull. \"But I didn\u0027t lie to you! And I wasn\u0027t with somebody else!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I didn\u0027t know that!\" I hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know it now!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I shouldn\u0027t be mad! But I am!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes slapped both hands over his face and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever had one of those funky dreams where a super-famous celebrity is madly and passionately in love with you? Then you wake up? You know it\u0027s not real, but it still feels real. The emotions are so intense, and all those leftover feelings make it seem like maybe it really did happen? Like once I had a wickedly naughty dream about Matt Lauer, which was kind of weird because he\u0027s not really my type. But still, I spent the whole next day thinking he might actually call me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the state I was in right now. I felt as though something major had happened and I responded accordingly. The fact I had it all terribly wrong was irrelevant. It was too late because I\u0027d already cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes opened his mouth, but it took a full ten seconds for any sound to come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re unbelievable, Sadie. I have to go.\" Then he walked out the door and down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should\u0027ve called after him, but I was still mad. Mad about nothing, it seemed. I think I may have screwed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDody trotted up the steps a few minutes later to find me perched on the edge of the chair, staring vacantly. She wagged a finger at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie Turner, I have never been one to mind my own business and I\u0027m not going to start now. What did you say to that young man? He seemed very upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s watching the kids, Dody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"They\u0027re fine. I told them to stay out of the water. What\u0027s going on with you and Des?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped up, rushing out the door and down the steps. \"You can\u0027t leave them alone on the beach!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried after me. \"Don\u0027t go changing the subject, missy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got to the beach and the kids were fine. But Dody made me sit down and tell her what happened. I told her everything, even admitting my mistake. Now we were sitting under an umbrella while the kids built a castle and decorated it with stones and feathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling, you know what they say about assumptions and how they make a dummy out of a U and a Y.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An ass, Dody. To assume makes an ass of U and me. It\u0027s a play on words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, whatever it is, smarty-pants English major, you\u0027re being foolish. Why do you work so hard at making things harder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\" I was getting really tired of her saying that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do! You should have asked him about that girl instead of jumping to concussions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conclusions!\" God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to give people a chance to explain once in a while. You\u0027re just like your mother. She holds a grudge like an elephant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I smoked, because I could really use a cigarette right about now. \"I\u0027m not holding a grudge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? You don\u0027t think you\u0027re blaming Des for something he didn\u0027t do because Richard cheated on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dody, that\u0027s not fair!\" I wished Anita Parker was here. She must have a pack of smokes in that big beach bag of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair? Whoever told you life was fair?\" Dody pulled a tissue from between her breasts and dabbed at her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did! You\u0027re always talking about karma and telling me what goes around comes around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s always fair. What I mean is that whatever energy you send out into the universe is what you get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying I deserve whatever rotten shit I get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took off her sunglasses to stare at me. \"No. I\u0027m saying that if you expect the worst from people that\u0027s what you\u0027ll see. You take offense where none is intended, like your mother does. She didn\u0027t used to be that way, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she used to be happy and sweet and funny. But somewhere along the way someone disappointed her, and she punished every single person that came along after that. And then, of course, there was your father. He was a big disappointment too. And she never got over it. I don\u0027t want to see you ending up like she has, darling. Life is to be embraced. It\u0027s meant to be lived and enjoyed. Make your mistakes, but make them with gusto and learn from them. Some people will still let you down, like Richard. He\u0027s the type with an itch that can\u0027t be scratched. But I promise, if you start looking for the best in people, you\u0027ll be very surprised at what you find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burned, prickling the way they did when I tried not to cry. It was a familiar feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDody put a soft arm around me. \"I think you might owe that boy an apology. Maybe we should make him some cookies.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-17.html","bookId":2788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM"}
