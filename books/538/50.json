In lonely districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless pedestrian, and knowing this Tess pursued the nearest course along by-lanes that she would almost have feared in the day time; but marauders were wanting now, and spectral fears were driven out of her mind by thoughts of her mother. Thus she proceeded mile after mile, ascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow, and about midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born. Having already traversed about five miles on the upland she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished. The winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan starlight as she followed it, and soon she paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell. It was the heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part of the Vale to which turnpike-roads had never penetrated. Superstitions linger longest on these heavy soils. Having once been forest, at this shadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character, the far and the near being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its presence. The harts that had been hunted here, the witches that had been pricked and ducked, the green-spangled fairies that `whickered\u0027 at you as you passed; the place teemed with beliefs in them still, and they formed an impish multitude now. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt Nuttlebury she passed the village inn, whose sign creaked in response to the greeting of her footsteps, which not a human soul heard but herself. Under the thatched roofs her mind\u0027s eye beheld relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow, as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on Hambledon Hill. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had threaded, and entered Marlott, passing the field in which, as a club-girl, she had first seen Angel Clare, when he had not danced with her; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet. In the direction of her mother\u0027s house she saw a light. It came from the bedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at her. As soon as she could discern the outline of the house - newly thatched with her money - it had all its old effect upon Tess\u0027s imagination. Part of her body and life it ever seemed to be; the slope of its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of brick which topped the chimney, all had something in common with her personal character. A stupefaction had come into these features, to her regard; it meant the illness of her mother. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody; the lower room was vacant, but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came to the top of the stairs, and whispered that Mrs Durbeyfield was no better, though she was sleeping just then. Tess prepared herself a breakfast, and then took her place as nurse in her mother\u0027s chamber. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, when she contemplated the children, they had all a curiously elongated look; although she had been away little more than a year their growth was astounding; and the necessity of applying herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHer father\u0027s ill-health was of the same indefinite kind, and he sat in his chair as usual. But the day after her arrival he was unusually bright. He had a rational scheme for living, and Tess asked him what it was. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027m thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this part of England,\u0027 he said, `asking them to subscribe to a fund to maintain me. I\u0027m sure they\u0027d see it as a romantical, artistical, and proper thing to do. They spend lots o\u0027 money in keeping up old ruins, and finding the bones o\u0027things, and such like; and living remains must be more interesting to \u0027em still, if they only knowed of me. Would that somebody would go round and tell \u0027em what there is living among \u0027em, and they thinking nothing of him! If Pa\u0027son Tringham, who discovered me, had lived, he\u0027d ha done it, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had grappled with pressing matters in hand, which seemed little improved by her remittances. When indoor necessities had been cased she turned her attention to external things. It was now the season for planting and sowing; many gardens and allotments of the villagers had already received their spring tillage; but the garden and the allotment of the Durbeyfields were behindhand. She found, to her dismay, that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed potatoes,-that last lapse of the improvident. At the earliest moment she obtained what others she could procure, and in a few days her father was well enough to see to the garden, under Tess\u0027s persuasive efforts: while she herself undertook the allotment-plot which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the village. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber, where she was not now required by reason of her mother\u0027s improvement. Violent motion relieved thought. The plot of ground was in a high, dry open enclosure, where there were forty or fifty such pieces, and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the day had ended. Digging began usually at six o\u0027clock, and extended indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight. Just now heaps of dead weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots, the dry weather favouring their combustion. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne fine day Tess and \u0027Liza-Lu worked on here with their neighbours till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that divided the plots. As soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare of the couch-grass and cabbage-stalk fires began to light up the allotments fitfully, their outlines appearing and disappearing under the dense smoke as wafted by the wind. When a fire glowed, banks of smoke, blown level along the ground, would themselves become illuminated to an opaque lustre, screening the workpeople from one another; and the meaning of the `pillar of a cloud,\u0027 which was a wall by day and a light by night, could be understood. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs evening thickened some of the gardening men and women gave over for the night, but the greater number remained to get their planting done, Tess being among them, though she sent her sister home. It was on one of the couch-burning plots that she laboured with her fork, its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little clicks. Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire; then it would leave her figure free, irradiated by the brassy glare from the heap. She was oddly dressed to-night, and presented a somewhat staring aspect, her attire being a gown bleached by many washings, with a short black jacket over it, the effect of the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one. The women further back wore white aprons, which, with their pale faces, were all that could be seen of them in the gloom, except when at moments they caught a flash from the flames. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWestward, the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower sky. Above, Jupiter hung like a full-blown jonquil, so bright as almost to throw a shade. A few small nondescript stars were appearing elsewhere. Iii the distance a dog barked, and wheels occasionally rattled along the dry road. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStill the prongs continued to click assiduously, for it was not late-, and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in it that cheered the workers on. Something in the place, the hour, the crackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and shade, made others as well as Tess enjoy being there. Nightfall, which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer as a lover, came as a tranquillizer on this March day. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNobody looked at his or her companions. The eyes of all were on the soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires. Hence as Tess stirred the clods, and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a hope that Clare would ever hear them, she did not for a long time notice the person who worked nearest to her - a man in a long smockfrock who, she found, was forking the same plot as herself, and whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work. She became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer. Sometimes the smoke divided them; then it swerved, and the two were visible to each other but divided from all the rest. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTess did not speak to her fellow-worker, nor did he speak to her. Nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been there when it was broad daylight, and that she did not know him as any one of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her absences having been so long and frequent of late years. By-and-by he dug so close to her that the fire-beams were reflected as distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own. On going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she found that he did the same on the other side. The fire flared up, and she beheld the face of d\u0027Urberville. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the most old-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that chilled her as to its bearing. D\u0027Urberville emitted a low long laugh. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`If I were inclined to joke I should say, How much this seems like Paradise!\u0027 he remarked whimsically, looking at her with an inclined head. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`What do you say?\u0027 she weakly asked. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`A jester might say this is just like Paradise. You are Eve, and I am the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior animal. I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton\u0027s when I was theological. Some of it goes-- \u003c/p\u003e   \n\u003cp\u003e`Entirely. To see you; nothing more. The smockfrock, which I saw hanging for sale as I came along, was an after-thought, that I mightn\u0027t be noticed. I come to protest against your working like this.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`But I like doing it - it is for my father.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Your engagement at the other place is ended?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Yes.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Where are you going to next? To join your dear husband?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe could not bear the humiliating reminder. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`O - I don\u0027t know!\u0027 she said bitterly. `I have no husband!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`It is quite true - in the sense you mean. But you have a friend, and I have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself. When you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there for you.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`O, Alec, I wish you wouldn\u0027t give me anything at all! I cannot take it from you! I don\u0027t like - it is not right!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`It is right!\u0027 he cried lightly. `I am not going to see a woman whom I feel so tenderly for as I do for you, in trouble without trying to help her.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`But I am very well off! I am only in trouble about - about - not about living at all!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, and desperately resumed her digging, tears dripping upon the fork-handle and upon the clods. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`About the children - your brothers and sisters,\u0027 he resumed. `I\u0027ve been thinking of them.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTess\u0027s heart quivered - he was touching her in a weak place. He had divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`If your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`He can with my assistance. He must!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`And with mine.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`No, sir!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`How damned foolish this is!\u0027 burst out d\u0027Urberville. `Why, he thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`He don\u0027t. I\u0027ve undeceived him.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`The more fool you!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eD\u0027Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u0027s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`O, Tessy - what do you think! \u0027Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u0027s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness; and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance, till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`What, Tess, shan\u0027t we talk to father never no more?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`But father was only a little bit ill!\u0027 exclaimed Tess distractedly. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Liza-Lu came up. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`He dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother said there was no chance for him, because his heart was growed in.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was out of danger, and the indisposed one was dead. The news meant even more than it sounded. Her father\u0027s life had a value apart from his personal achievements, or perhaps it would not have had much. It was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and premises were held under a lease; and it had long been coveted by the tenant-farmer for his regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage accommodation. Moreover, `leviers\u0027 were disapproved of in villages almost as much as little freeholders, because of their independence of manner, and when a lease determined it was never renewed. \u003c/p\u003e     \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4745.html","bookId":538,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:11:16 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:11:16 AM"}
