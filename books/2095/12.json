But - \" Deborah stopped and scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But some of us may not have believed she\u0027d pass the tests,\" Faye interpreted, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s face was pale and angry. The diadem she wore seemed to give her added stature, so that she looked taller even than Faye. Moonlight shimmered in her hair as it had off the blade of the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she did pass the tests,\" she said coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you\u0027ve interrupted a ritual - broken it - while I was calling down the Powers. I hope you have a better reason than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you a reason,\" Deborah said. \"She\u0027s not really one of us. Her mother married an outsider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do you want?\" Diana said. \"Do you want us never to have a real Circle? You know we need twelve to get anything done. What are we supposed to do, wait until your parents - or the Hendersons - have another baby? None of the rest of us even has both parents alive. No.\" Diana turned to face the others in the group, who were standing around the inside perimeter of the circle. \"We\u0027re the last,\" she told them. \"The last generation in the New World. And if we can\u0027t complete our Circle, then it all ends here. With us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie spoke up. She was wearing ordinary clothes under a pale green fringed shawl that looked both tattered and fragile, as if it were very old. \"Our parents and grandparents would like that,\" she said. \"They want us to leave it all in the past, the way they did and their parents did. They don\u0027t want us digging up the old traditions and waking the Old Powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re scared,\" Deborah said scornfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be happy if we can\u0027t complete the Circle,\" Melanie said. \"But is that what we want?\" She looked at Faye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye murmured coolly, \"Individuals can do quite a lot on their own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" Laurel put in. \"Not like a real Circle. Not unless,\" she added, \"somebody was planning to get hold of the Master Tools and use them all by herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye gave her a slow, dazzling smile. \"I\u0027m not the one searching for the lost tools,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all off the point,\" said Diana sharply. \"The question is, do we want a complete Circle or don\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do,\" one of the Henderson brothers said. No, Chris, Cassie corrected herself. Suddenly she could tell them apart. Both the brothers looked white and strained in the moonlight, but Chris\u0027s eyes were less savage. \"We\u0027re going to do whatever it takes to find out who killed Kori,\" Chris finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then take care of them,\" Doug put in. He made a gesture of stabbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we need a full Circle,\" said Melanie. \"A twelfth person and a seventh girl. Cassie is both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she\u0027s passed the tests,\" Diana repeated. \"Her mother was one of us. She went away, yes, but now she\u0027s come back. And she brought her daughter to us just when we need her. Just exactly when we need her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbornness still lingered in Deborah\u0027s eyes. \"Who says she can even use the Powers?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Diana replied steadily. \"I can sense it in her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so do I,\" Faye said unexpectedly. Deborah turned to stare at her, and she smiled ingenuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say she can call on Earth and Fire, at least,\" Faye continued, maddeningly bland. \"She might even prove to have quite a talent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why, Cassie wondered dazedly, did that make hairs on the back of her neck stand up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s brows were drawn together as she gave Faye a long, searching look. But then she turned to Deborah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that satisfy your objection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a beat. Then Deborah nodded, sullenly, and stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said Diana, with a quiet politeness that seemed to overlay an icy anger, \"can we please get on with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stood away as she returned to her position. Once again she lifted the dagger to the sky, then to the cardinal points of the compass, then to Cassie. Once again she spoke the words that had sent chills down Cassie\u0027s spine, but this time she finished them uninterrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarth and water, fire and air,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee your daughter standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy dark of moon and light of sun,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I will, let it be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy challenge, trial, and sacred vow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet her join the Circle now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlesh and sinew, blood and bone,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie now becomes our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Laurel said softly from behind Cassie. \"You\u0027re in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn. I\u0027m in. Cassie knew, with a feeling of wild exhilaration, that nothing would ever be the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana was unclasping the silver necklace she was wearing. Cassie\u0027s eyes were drawn to the crescent moon pendant that hung from it. It was like the one on the diadem, Cassie realized - and like Deborah\u0027s tattoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a token,\" Diana said, fastening the chain around Cassie\u0027s neck, \"of your membership in the Circle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she hugged Cassie. It wasn\u0027t a spontaneous gesture; it had more the feeling of a ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext she turned Cassie around to face the others and said, \"The Powers have accepted her. I\u0027ve accepted her. Now each of you has to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel was the first to step up. Her face was serious, but there was a genuine warmth and friendliness in the depths of her brown eyes. She hugged Cassie, then kissed her lightly on the cheek. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re one of us,\" she whispered, and stepped back, her long, light-brown hair fluttering slightly in the breeze. \"Thanks,\" Cassie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie was next. Her embrace was more formal, and her cool, intellectual gray eyes still intimidated Cassie. But when she said, \"Welcome to the Club,\" she sounded as if she meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah, by contrast, was scowling as she stepped forward, and she hugged Cassie as if she were trying to crack a rib or two. She didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean hurried up, looking eager. His hug was a little too long and too close for Cassie\u0027s taste, and she ended up having to extricate herself. He said, \"Glad you\u0027re in,\" with his eyes fixed on her nightgown in a way that made Cassie wish it were flannel instead of light cotton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell,\" she said under her breath as he stepped back, and Diana, standing beside her, had to bite her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder normal circumstances the Henderson brothers might have been even worse. But tonight they didn\u0027t seem to care if it was a girl or a block of wood they were embracing. They hugged her mechanically and stepped back to watch again with their angry, faraway eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was Nick\u0027s turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt something inside her tighten. It wasn\u0027t that she was attracted to him, exactly, but... she couldn\u0027t help feeling a slight inner tremor when she looked up at him. He was so handsome, and the coldness that surrounded him like a thin layer of dark ice seemed only to enhance his looks. He\u0027d stood back and observed the entire ceremony tonight with such detachment, as if none of it affected him one way or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven his embrace was noncommittal. Sexless. As if he were merely going through the motions while thinking of something else. His arms were strong, though - well, of course, thought Cassie. Any guy who had an - arrangement - with Faye would have to be strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzan smelled of perfume, and when she kissed Cassie\u0027s cheek, Cassie felt sure she left a smudge of cherry-colored lipstick. Hugging her was like hugging a scented pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Faye came. Her heavy-lidded eyes were gleaming enigmatically, as if she were aware of Cassie\u0027s discomfiture and enjoying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Cassie was aware of was Faye\u0027s height and how much she herself wanted to run. She had a panicked conviction that Faye was going to do something awful...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Faye simply murmured, as she stepped back, \"So the little white mouse is tougher than she looks. I was betting you wouldn\u0027t even last through the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I did,\" Cassie muttered. She desperately wanted to sit down and gather her thoughts. So much had happened so fast... but she was in. Even Faye had accepted her. That fact could not be changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Diana said quietly. \"That\u0027s it for the initiation ritual. Normally after this we\u0027d have a party or something, but...\" She looked at Cassie and lifted her hands. Cassie nodded. Tonight, a party could hardly be less appropriate. \"So I think we should formally dispel the Circle, but go on and have a regular meeting. That way we can get Cassie caught up on what she needs to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were nods around the circle and a collective breath released. Diana picked up a handful of sand and poured it over the line drawn on the beach. The others followed suit, each pouring a handful and smoothing it down so that the circle\u0027s outline was blurred, erased. Then they distributed themselves among the still-lighted candles, some sitting on the sand, others on out-thrusts of rock. Nick remained standing, a cigarette in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana waited until everyone was quiet, looking at her, then she turned to Cassie. Her face was grave and her green eyes were earnest. \"Now that you\u0027re one of us,\" she said simply, \"I think it\u0027s time to tell you what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s breath caught. So many bizarre things had happened to her since she\u0027d come to New Salem, and now she was about to hear the explanation. But strangely, she wasn\u0027t sure she needed to be told. Ever since they\u0027d brought her here tonight, all sorts of things had been arranging themselves in her mind. A hundred little oddities that she\u0027d noticed about New Salem, a hundred little mysteries that she\u0027d been unable to solve. Somehow, her brain had begun putting them together, and now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the faces around her, lit by moonlight and flickering candlelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" she said slowly, \"that I already know.\" Honesty compelled her to add, \"Some of it, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes?\" Faye raised her eyebrows. \"Why don\u0027t you tell us, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked at Diana, who nodded. \"Well, for one thing,\" she said slowly, \"I know you\u0027re not the Mickey Mouse Club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckles. \"You\u0027d better believe it,\" Deborah muttered. \"We\u0027re not the Girl Scouts, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know...\" Cassie paused. \"I know that you can light fires without matches. And that you don\u0027t use feverfew just in salads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye examined her nails, looking innocent, and Laurel smiled ruefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that you can make things move when they\u0027re not alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was Faye who smiled. Deborah and Suzan exchanged smug glances, and Suzan murmured, \"Sssssss...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know everybody\u0027s afraid of you at school, even the adults. They\u0027re afraid of anyone who lives on Crowhaven Road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to be more afraid,\" said Doug Henderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you use rocks for spot remover - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crystals,\" murmured Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - and there\u0027s something more than tea leaves in your tea. And I know\" - Cassie swallowed and then went on, deliberately - \"that you can push somebody without touching them, and make them fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence at this. Several people looked at Faye. Faye tilted her chin back and looked at the ocean with narrowed eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" Diana said. \"You\u0027ve learned a lot from just watching - and we\u0027ve been a little lax with security. But I think you should hear the entire story from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell it,\" said Faye. And when Diana looked at her doubtfully, she added, \"Why not? I like a good story. And I certainly know this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" said Diana. \"But could you please try to stick to the point? I know your stories, Faye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly,\" Faye said blandly. \"Now, let me see, where shall I start?\" She considered a moment, head tilted, and then smiled. \"Once upon a time,\" she said, \"there was a quaint little village called Salem. And it was just filled with quaint little Puritans - all-American, hardworking, honest, brave, and true - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like some people here we all know,\" Faye said, undisturbed by the interruption. She stood, switching her glorious black mane behind her, clearly enjoying being the center of attention. The ocean, with its endlessly breaking waves, formed a perfect background as she began to pace back and forth, her black silk blouse sliding down just far enough to leave one shoulder bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These Puritans were filled with pure little thoughts - most of them. A few just may have been unhappy with their boring little Puritan lives, all work, no play, dresses up to here\" - she indicated her neck - \"and six hours of church on Sundays...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye,\" said Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye ignored her. \"And the neighbors,\" she said. \"All those neighbors who watched you, gossiped about you, monitored you to make sure you weren\u0027t wearing an extra button on your dress or smiling on your way to meeting. You had to be meek in those days, and keep your eyes down, and do as you were told without asking questions. If you were a girl, anyway. You weren\u0027t even allowed to play with dolls because they were things of the devil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie, fascinated despite herself, watched Faye pacing and thought again of jungle cats. Caged ones. If Faye had lived in those days, Cassie thought, she would have been quite a handful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe some of those young girls weren\u0027t so happy,\" Faye said. \"Who knows? But anyway, one winter a few of them got together to tell fortunes. They shouldn\u0027t have, of course. It was wicked. But they did it anyway. One of them had a slave who came from the West Indies and knew about fortune-telling. It helped to while away those long, dull winter nights.\" She glanced sideways under black lashes toward Nick, as if to say that she could have suggested a better way herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it preyed on their poor little Puritan minds,\" Faye went on, looking sorrowful. \"They felt guilty. And eventually one of them had a nervous collapse. She got sick, delirious, and she confessed. Then the secret was out. And all the other young girls were on the hot seat. It wasn\u0027t good in those days to get caught fooling around with the supernatural. The grown-ups didn\u0027t like it. So the poor little Puritan girls had to point the finger at somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye held up her own long, tapering, scarlet-tipped finger, trailing it across the seated group like a gun. She stopped in front of Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked at it, then up into Faye\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they did,\" Faye said pleasantly. She withdrew the finger as if sheathing a sword, and went on. \"They pointed at the West Indian slave, and then at a couple of other old women they didn\u0027t like. Women with a bad reputation around the village. And when they pointed, they said...\" She paused for dramatic effect, and tipped her face up to the crescent moon hanging in the sky. Then she looked back at Cassie. \"They said... witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ripple went through the group, of agitation, bitter amusement, exasperation. Heads were shaking in disgust. Cassie felt the hairs at the back of her neck tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do you know what?\" Faye looked over her audience, holding them all spellbound. Then she smiled, slowly, and whispered, \"It worked. Nobody blamed them for their little fortune-telling games. Everyone was too busy hunting out the witches in their midst. The only problem,\" Faye continued, her black eyebrows now raised in scorn, \"was that those Puritans couldn\u0027t recognize a witch if they fell over one. They looked for women who were offbeat, or too independent, or... rich. Convicted witches forfeited their worldly goods, so it could be quite a profitable business to accuse them. But all the while the real witches were right there under their noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, you see,\" Faye said softly, \"there really were witches at Salem. Not the poor women - and men - they accused. They didn\u0027t even get one right. But the witches were there, and they didn\u0027t like what was happening. It hit a little too close to home. A few of them even tried to stop the witch trials - but that only tended to arouse suspicion. It was too dangerous even to be a friend of one of the prisoners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, and there was a silence. The faces surrounding Cassie now were not amused, but cold and angry. As if this story was something that resonated in their bones; not a cobwebby tale from the dead past, but a living warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Cassie asked at last, her own voice subdued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the accused witches? They died. The unlucky ones, at least, the ones who wouldn\u0027t confess. Nineteen were hanged before the governor put a stop to it. The last public executions took place exactly three hundred years ago... September 22, the fall equinox, 1692. No, the poor accused witches didn\u0027t have much luck. But the real witches... well...\" Faye smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The real witches got away. Discreetly, of course. After the fuss was over. They quietly packed up and moved north to start their own little village, where no one would point fingers because everyone would be the same. And they called their little village...\" She looked at Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New Salem,\" Cassie said. In her mind, she was seeing the crest on the high school building. \"Incorporated 1693,\" she added softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Just one year after the trials ended. So you see, that\u0027s how our little town was founded. With just the twelve members of that coven, and their families. We\" - Faye gestured gracefully around the group - \"are what\u0027s left of the descendants of those twelve families. Their only descendants. While the rest of the riffraff you see around the school and the town - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Sally Waltman,\" Deborah put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - are the descendants of the servants. The help,\" Faye said sweetly. \"Or of outsiders who drifted in and were allowed to settle here. But those twelve houses on Crowhaven Road are the houses of the original families. Our families. They intermarried and kept their blood pure - most of them, anyway. And eventually they produced us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to understand,\" Diana said quietly from Cassie\u0027s side. \"Some of what Faye has told you is speculation. We don\u0027t really know what caused the witch hunts in 1692. But we do know what happened with our own ancestors because we have their journals, their old records, their spell books. Their Books of Shadows.\" She turned and picked something up off the sand, and Cassie recognized the book that had been on the window seat the day Diana cleaned her sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This,\" Diana said, holding it up, \"was my great-great-grandmother\u0027s. She got it from her mother, who got it from her mother, and so on. Each of them wrote in it; they recorded the spells they did, the rituals, the important events in their lives. Each of them passed it on to the next generation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until our great-grandmothers\u0027 time, anyway,\" said Deborah. \"Maybe eighty, ninety years ago. They decided the whole thing was too scary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too wicked,\" Faye put in, her golden eyes gleaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They hid the books and tried to forget the old knowledge,\" said Diana. \"They taught their kids it was wrong to be different. They tried to be normal, to be like the outsiders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were wrong,\" Chris said. He leaned forward, his jaw set, his face etched with pain. \"We can\u0027t be like them. Kori knew that. She - \" He broke off and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, Chris,\" Laurel said softly. \"We know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean spoke up eagerly, his thin chest puffing out. \"They hid the old stuff, but we found it,\" he said. \"We wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we wouldn\u0027t,\" said Melanie, casting an amused glance at him. \"Of course, some of us were busy playing Batman while the older ones were rediscovering our heritage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And some of us had a little more natural talent than others,\" Faye added. She spread out her fingers, admiring the long red nails. \"A little more natural - flair - for calling on the Powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" said Laurel. She raised her eye-brows and then looked significantly at Diana. \"Some of us do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all have talent,\" Diana said. \"We started discovering that when we were really young - babies, practically. Even our parents couldn\u0027t ignore it. They did try to keep us from using it for a while, but most of them have given up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of them even help us,\" Laurel said. \"Like my grandmother. But we still get most of what we need from the old books.\" Cassie thought about her own grandmother. Had she been trying to help Cassie? Cassie felt sure she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or from our own heads,\" said Doug. He grinned a wild and handsome grin and for an instant looked again like the boy who\u0027d gone racing through the hallways on roller blades. \"It\u0027s instinct, you know? Pure instinct. Primal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our parents hate it,\" said Suzan. \"My father says we\u0027ll only make trouble with the outsiders. He says the outsiders will get us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug\u0027s teeth showed white in the moonlight. \"We\u0027ll get them,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t understand,\" Diana said softly. \"Even among ourselves not everybody realizes that the Powers can be used for good. But we\u0027re the ones who can call on the Powers, and we know. That\u0027s what\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel nodded. \"My grandmother says there will always be outsiders who hate us. There\u0027s nothing we can do but try and keep away from them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie thought suddenly of the principal holding the hanged doll by the back of its dress. How apt, he\u0027d said. Well, no wonder... if he thought she was one of them already. Then her mind drew up short. \"Do you mean,\" she said, \"that even adults know what you - what we are? Outsider adults?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the ones around here,\" Diana said. \"The ones who grew up on the island. They\u0027ve known for centuries - but they\u0027ve always kept quiet. If they want to live here, they have to. That\u0027s just the way it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the last few generations, relations have been very good between our people and the outsiders,\" Melanie said. \"That\u0027s what our grandparents say, anyhow. But now we\u0027ve stirred things up. The outsiders may not keep quiet forever. They might try to do something to stop us - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might? They already have,\" Deborah said. \"What do you think happened to Kori?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly voices rose in a babble as the Henderson brothers, Sean, Suzan, and Deborah burst into argument. Diana raised her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough! This isn\u0027t the time,\" she said. \"What happened to Kori is one of the things our Circle is going to find out. Now that we\u0027re complete, we should be able to do it. But not tonight. And as long as I\u0027m leader - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Temporary leader. Until November,\" Faye put in sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as I\u0027m temporary leader, we\u0027ll do things when I say and not jump to any conclusions. All right?\" Diana looked around at them. Some faces were shuttered, expressionless; others, like Deborah\u0027s, openly hostile. But most of the members nodded or gave some sign of acquiescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. And tonight is for initiating Cassie.\" She looked at Cassie. \"Do you have any questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Cassie had the nagging feeling that there was something she should be asking, something important, but she couldn\u0027t think of what. \"The guys in the Circle - what do you call them? I mean, are they wizards or warlocks or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Diana. \"\u0027Wizard\u0027 is an old-fashioned word - it means a wise man who usually worked alone. And \u0027warlock\u0027 comes from a word meaning traitor, deceiver. \u0027Witch\u0027 is the proper term for all of us, even guys. Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" Faye said. \"Now that you\u0027ve heard our story, we have just one question to ask you.\" She fixed Cassie with an odd half smile and said in a sweet, false voice, \"Are you planning to be a good witch or a bad witch?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-initiation-the-secret-circle-1/page-12.html","bookId":2095,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:46 PM"}
