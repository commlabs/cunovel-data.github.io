Utterance, even the utterance which speaks in the inmost soul, failed him. \u0026nbsp;He had in some way that he knew not hurt—wounded—killed Stephen; for the finer part was gone from the Stephen that he had known and worshipped so long. \u0026nbsp;She wished him gone; she wished she had never seen him; she hoped to God never to see him again. \u0026nbsp;Life for him was over and done!

\u0026nbsp;There was nothing to look forward to; nothing to look back at! \u0026nbsp;The present was a living pain whose lightest element was despair. \u0026nbsp;As, however, he got further and further away, his practical mind began to work; he thought over matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he could dispose of his affairs, so to cause as little comment as might be, and to save the possibility of worry or distress of any kind to Stephen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even then, in his agony of mind, his heart was with her; it was not the least among his troubles that he would have to be away from her when perhaps she would need him most. \u0026nbsp;And yet whenever he would come to this point in his endless chain of thought, he would have to stop for a while, overcome with such pain that his power of thinking was paralysed. \u0026nbsp;He would never, could never, be of service to her again. \u0026nbsp;He had gone out of her life, as she had gone out of his life; though she never had, nor never could out of his thoughts. \u0026nbsp;It was all over! \u0026nbsp;All the years of sweetness, of hope, and trust, and satisfied and justified faith in each other, had been wiped out by that last terrible, cruel meeting. \u0026nbsp;Oh! how could she have said such things to him! \u0026nbsp;How could she have thought them! \u0026nbsp;And there she was now in all the agony of her unrestrained passion. \u0026nbsp;Well he knew, from his long experience of her nature, how she must have suffered to be in such a state of mind, to have so forgotten all the restraint of her teaching and her life! \u0026nbsp;Poor, poor Stephen! \u0026nbsp;Fatherless now as well as motherless; and friendless as well as fatherless! \u0026nbsp;No one to calm her in the height of her wild abnormal passion! \u0026nbsp;No one to comfort her when the fit had passed! \u0026nbsp;No one to sympathise with her for all that she had suffered! \u0026nbsp;No one to help her to build new and better hopes out of the wreck of her mad ideas! \u0026nbsp;He would cheerfully have given his life for her. \u0026nbsp;Only last night he was prepared to kill, which was worse than to die, for her sake. \u0026nbsp;And now to be far away, unable to help, unable even to know how she fared. \u0026nbsp;And behind her eternally the shadow of that worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted her to a chance comer in his drunken delirium. \u0026nbsp;It was too bitter to bear. \u0026nbsp;How could God lightly lay such a burden on his shoulders who had all his life tried to walk in sobriety and chastity and in all worthy and manly ways! \u0026nbsp;It was unfair! \u0026nbsp;It was unfair! \u0026nbsp;If he could do anything for her? \u0026nbsp;Anything! \u0026nbsp;Anything! . . .

why am I lying on the ground?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All at once wakened memory opened on her its flood-gates, and overwhelmed her with pain. \u0026nbsp;With her hands pressed to her throbbing temples and her burning face close to the ground, she began to recall what she could of the immediate past. \u0026nbsp;It all seemed like a terrible dream. \u0026nbsp;By degrees her intelligence came back to its normal strength, and all at once, as does one suddenly wakened from sleep to the knowledge of danger, she sat up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Somehow the sense of time elapsed made Stephen look at her watch. \u0026nbsp;It was half-past twelve. \u0026nbsp;As she had come into the grove immediately after breakfast, and as Harold had almost immediately joined her, and as the interview between them had been but short, she must have lain on the ground for more than three hours. \u0026nbsp;She rose at once, trembling in every limb. \u0026nbsp;A new fear began to assail her; that she had been missed at home, and that some one might have come to look for her. \u0026nbsp;Up to now she had not been able to feel the full measure of pain regarding what had passed, but which would, she knew, come to her in the end. \u0026nbsp;It was too vague as yet; she could not realise that it had really been. \u0026nbsp;But the fear of discovery was immediate, and must be guarded against without delay. \u0026nbsp;As well as she could, she tidied herself and began to walk slowly back to the house, hoping to gain her own room unnoticed. \u0026nbsp;That her general intelligence was awake was shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered that she had forgotten her sunshade. \u0026nbsp;She went back and searched till she had found it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gaining her room without meeting any one, she at once change her dress, fearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray her. \u0026nbsp;Resolutely she put back from her mind all consideration of the past; there would be time for that later on. \u0026nbsp;Her nerves were already much quieter than they had been. \u0026nbsp;That long faint, or lapse into insensibility, had for the time taken the place of sleep. \u0026nbsp;There would be a price to be paid for it later; but for the present it had served its purpose. \u0026nbsp;Now and again she was disturbed by one thought; she could not quite remember what had occurred after Harold had left, and just before she became unconscious. \u0026nbsp;She dared not dwell upon it, however. \u0026nbsp;It would doubtless all come back to her when she had leisure to think the whole matter over as a connected narrative.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the gong sounded for lunch she went down, with a calm exterior, to face the dreaded ordeal of another meal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Luncheon passed off without a hitch. \u0026nbsp;She and her aunt talked as usual over all the small affairs of the house and the neighbourhood, and the calm restraint was in itself soothing. \u0026nbsp;Even then she could not help feeling how much convention is to a woman’s life. \u0026nbsp;Had it not been for these recurring trials of set hours and duties she could never have passed the last day and night without discovery of her condition of mind. \u0026nbsp;That one terrible, hysterical outburst was perhaps the safety valve. \u0026nbsp;Had it been spread over the time occupied in conventional duties its force even then might have betrayed her; but without the necessity of nerving herself to conventional needs, she would have infallibly betrayed herself by her negative condition.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After lunch she went to her own boudoir where, when she had shut the inner door, no one was allowed to disturb her without some special need in the house or on the arrival of visitors. \u0026nbsp;This ‘sporting oak’ was the sign of ‘not at home’ which she had learned in her glimpse of college life. \u0026nbsp;Here in the solitude of safety, she began to go over the past, resolutely and systematically.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She had already been so often over the memory of the previous humiliating and unhappy day that she need not revert to it at present. \u0026nbsp;Since then had she not quarrelled with Harold, whom she had all her life so trusted that her quarrel with him seemed to shake the very foundations of her existence? \u0026nbsp;As yet she had not remembered perfectly all that had gone on under the shadow of the beech grove. \u0026nbsp;She dared not face it all at once, even as yet. \u0026nbsp;Time must elapse before she should dare to cry; to think of her loss of Harold was to risk breaking down altogether. \u0026nbsp;Already she felt weak. \u0026nbsp;The strain of the last forty-eight hours was too much for her physical strength. \u0026nbsp;She began to feel, as she lay back in her cushioned chair, that a swoon is no worthy substitute for sleep. \u0026nbsp;Indeed it had seemed to make the need for sleep even more imperative.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was all too humiliating! \u0026nbsp;She wanted to think over what had been; to recall it as far as possible so as to fix it in her mind, whilst it was still fresh. \u0026nbsp;Later on, some action might have to be based on her recollection. \u0026nbsp;And yet . . .
