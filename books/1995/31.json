A small silver package with Rush’s familiar scrawl on the note was being held out to me. “Rush wanted to provide you with your something old,” she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t tried to get any of those things. I had forgotten about that tradition. Smiling, I took the package and opened it. Inside was a very expensive looking pearl ring. The silver band it was on was elegant and engraved. I held it up to see the engraving. It said, “My love” in it. That too was old. Not something Rush had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small note lay tucked beside it. I picked it up and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was my grandmother’s. My father’s mother. She came to visit me before she passed away. I have fond memories of her visits and when she passed on she left this ring to me. In her will I was told to give it to the woman who completes me. She said it was given to her by my grandfather who passed away when my dad was just a baby but that she’d never loved another the way she’d loved him. He was her heart. You are mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is your something old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed and Bethy did too. I glanced over at her and she was beside me reading the note. “Damn, who knew Rush Finlay could be so romantic,” she said and sniffed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew. He’d shown me that more than once. I slipped the ring on my right hand and it fit perfectly. I figured this was not a coincidence. Smiling, I looked over at Bethy. “Thank you for everything,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged me and nodded. “I should be thanking you. You’re the best friend I’ve ever had.” Before I could say more she ducked out of the room with a final wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to look into the mirror to study myself. The pearl colored satin gathered over my breasts stayed up without straps thanks to my pregnant cup size. The waistline was high and right under my breasts and was covered in a million tiny pearls. Over the satin was a layer of chiffon that hung loosely in an A line until it hit a few inches above my knees. I’d chosen to go barefoot since I had to walk on the sand. My toenails had been painted a pale pink to match the rose petals scattered on the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door startled me and I turned to see Harlow step into the room. She was holding a small box. “You look like a princess,” she said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I replied. I felt like one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have something from Rush. He wanted to be the one to supply your something new,” she said and handed me the small gift. “I’d leave but I think you’ll need my help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the box and opened it quickly, excited to see what it was he had sent up here to me this time. Nestled inside was a delicate gold chain with several diamonds cut in the exact shape of my ring but much smaller. I held the anklet up and the sun coming through the windows caught the diamonds and danced around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll put it on you,” Harlow said and I laid the anklet in her hand then she fastened it around my ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d told Rush that I felt like I needed something on my feet but that I couldn’t imagine walking across the sand in shoes. This was his answer to that. I smiled and thanked Harlow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome. It’s beautiful on you,” she said before leaving the room just as quietly as she had entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my ankle in the mirror to admire it when another knock on the door came. A familiar face that I hadn’t been expecting at all smiled at me and I rushed over to hug Granny Q. I hadn’t invited Granny Q because I was worried that Rush would be upset about Cain being here. I knew he’d be the one to drive his grandmother and I couldn’t not invite Cain too. Tears stung my eyes as she squeezed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you’re here. I can’t believe you drove this far,” I gushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted my back and chuckled. “Well, I didn’t drive. That man of yours sent me and Cain plane tickets. First class. I’ve never been so pampered in my life. Was an experience, I tell ya.” If I didn’t already love Rush Finlay with every fiber of my being then I’d love him more for this. But he had all of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now don’t you go to blubbering on me and mess up that makeup. You look like your momma. Just like her. Don’t think your daddy could be happier than he is right now. I’m not supposed to come up here and make you cry. I’m here to give you something from Rush. He wanted to be the one to give you your something borrowed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silly smile on my face couldn’t be helped. He was sending me another gift. She handed me a small box wrapped just like the one that Harlow had brought. I took it and unwrapped it quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNestled in a satin box was a small note. I picked it up and underneath it was an old swatch of pink satin. It had been well worn and it was obviously cut from something else. I opened the note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve waited until today to show this to you. It hasn’t been easy to not say anything about it. But when I was reminded of who your mother was I was also reminded of this piece of satin. I had forgotten where it came from for a long time but I knew it was special so I kept it with me. All the time. Growing up, when I was scared or alone I would hold it in my hands and rub it across my face. It was a secret I wanted no one to know about. But it soothed me. When your father reminded me of the Mickey Mouse pancakes my memories of your mother all came back. With them I remembered the day I got this piece of satin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour mother always wore a pair of pink satin pajamas to bed at night. She would often rock me to sleep because I was difficult to get to calm down long enough to close my eyes. I loved it when she held me. My own mother never did. I would go to sleep at night rubbing my nose across her arm and the pink satin pajamas. The day she left I remember being scared. I didn’t want to be left with Georgianna. Your mother hugged me tightly then tucked this piece of satin cut from her pajamas in my hand and told me to use it at night when I was going to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d love to say this memory came back to me all on my own but it didn’t. I just knew the fabric had to do with the woman who made me pancakes. So, I asked your dad. He told me the story and I realized that the recurring dream I had growing up about the woman in the pink satin pajamas was real. Not a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s mine and you can’t have it (unless you really want it and then it’s yours).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is your something borrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you’re not wearing a lot of makeup ‘cause if you are you just cried half of it off,” Granny Q grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and took the tissue she was holding and wiped my face free of the tears. I wasn’t wearing much makeup, to Bethy’s dismay. The mascara I had on was waterproof which was a good thing. I touched the satin to my cheek and thought of my sweet momma leaving this for Rush. Then I folded it and tucked it into my strapless bra. I put the note away in the dresser. I wanted to keep that too. Forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I need to get on downstairs and get in my seat. I’ll see you soon,” Granny Q said and blew me a kiss before she headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to the mirror to check my makeup when another swift knock came on the door. My dad stepped inside with a smile on his face. “You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. That’s one lucky man down there. He just better remember it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Daddy,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out another small gift box similar to the ones the others had brought in here. “I have something for you from Rush. He wanted to be the one to give you your something blue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t keep the silly grin off my face. I had already figured out that was why he was here. Dad handed it to me. “I’ll stay. You’re going to need my help with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the box, excited about getting something else from Rush. A delicate gold chain that matched the anklet he’d sent me was nestled in the satin. I pulled it out and hanging from it was a teardrop shaped topaz. Beside it was another note. I took it out quickly and unfolded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis teardrop represents many things. The tears I know you’ve shed over holding your mother’s piece of satin. The tears you’ve shed over each loss you’ve experienced. But it also represents the tears we’ve both shed as we’ve felt the little life inside you begin to move. The tears I’ve shed over the fact I’ve been given someone like you to love. I never imagined anyone like you Blaire. But every time I think about forever with you I’m humbled that you chose me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is your something blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped another tear away and laughed. He was right. We’d had both sad and happy tears. I wanted this memory of both on me as we said our vows today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad took it from my hands and fastened it around my neck. I moved it so that it lay against my chest. I was complete. He’d made sure I had something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time for us to go down now,” Dad said to me before walking over to open the door. I followed him and then he led me down the stairs and out the front door. I was to walk under the house and come through an archway of pink roses and white twinkling lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping my hand into the crook of my dad’s arm, I let him lead me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-31.html","bookId":1995,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM"}
