And where is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt chilled by his words and shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a laugh, Astir stood, kissed my hand, and walked out. His peals of merriment taunted me as Magda and Adem stepped into the parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We return to Buda tomorrow night,” I informed them. “And pray I forgive you both by then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving them, I rushed to my room and flung myself across my bed. Tears of joy and relief streamed down my face and bloodied the coverlet. I did not care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was returning to Buda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJune 11, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Krone Hotel, Bistriţa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight we depart for Buda! I am thrilled beyond all comprehension! To once again be in a cosmopolitan city shall be a tremendous relief! I am so happy to be on my way at last, I can even forgive Astir for insisting we return to Buda without the benefit of his magicks. I still do not trust him completely, but I do believe he will not free Vlad. I think he speaks the truth when he says I amuse him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are departing by Astir’s private carriage and Adem has arranged for another cart to follow, carrying the coffins of my family. In just a week I shall once again be in the city where I met and fell in love with Ignatius. Despite all that Astir warned, I hope that my love will return to the city and find me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have decided to pardon Magda and Adem. Perhaps it is my utter relief to finally be returning to Buda that has me in such a merciful mood, but my anger over their deceit had faded by the time all my trunks were packed. I have yet to inform them that they are absolved, but I shall tell them when I find a suitable time. Besides, in my heart I may have forgiven them, but I am not inclined to inform them just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am saddened to depart without determining the fate of my beloved sister, Erzsébet, yet I can no longer linger in seclusion. I must leave behind the past and forge forward in my plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce my traveling trunks are removed from my room, we shall be off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed to travel in a long coat, scarf and gloves, I pulled on my bonnet as I trailed after the men carrying my luggage downstairs. Magda followed, carrying a small travel case. She appeared anxious, but I could not imagine what was to fear now that we were departing. Unless, of course, she thought I would never forgive her. I graced her with a small smile to alleviate her worry and she returned it thankfully. Just as we neared the top of the stairs, Adem rushed up to join us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have a complication,” Adem informed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever is it?” I asked, not really caring about some issue with our travel plans. “And can you take care of it immediately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is Katya and I believe you may need to intercede before things escalate any further,” Adem answered, his expression unusually grim. “I attempted to handle the situation and failed. Lord Astir is now attempting to calm the situation, but it is not going well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly? What has she done now?” I had started down the stairs, but paused at his words. Short of her informing the local priest of my nature, I really couldn’t imagine how she could cause any harm or cause such anxiety in Adem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem drew a breath, then said in a rush of words, “She had relations with Enre and her father discovered them in the act. He is enraged and disgraced. Lord Astir finds it amusing, so is being no help whatsoever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at Adem. “How could he be so foolish? This is a scandal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you are speaking of Lord Astir, he loves scandals. If you are speaking of Enre, I have had harsh words with him. He is remorseful. I had him leave to scout the road ahead to remove him from the situation so I could attempt to placate Toma, Katya’s father. Sadly, I failed and Lord Astir is not faring well either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does Toma desire to settle the issue, Adem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katya’s father is demanding an immediate marriage and recompense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Enre love her?” I asked, arching my eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Adem conceded. “He does not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, dear,” Magda whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katya is foolish, but I expected more of Enre. Why on earth did he seduce her if he did not love her? Did he not consider the ramifications?” I realized my voice was rising and I took a breath to calm my nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He claims she plied him with wine and seduced him,” Adem replied. “Of course, her story is contrary to his.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m inclined to believe him,” Adem continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, you are. You’re a man,” I grumbled irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried down the stairs to find the quarrelers and settle the argument so we could depart. I was done with the hotel and the drama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not difficult to find, Toma, Katya’s father. His angry voice boomed through the lower floor. I found Toma, his frightened wife, a weeping Katya, and Astir gathered in the parlor. Katya wailed, huddled in her mother’s arms as the older woman tried to calm her. Katya’s mother had harsh lines about her mouth and eyes, but she strongly resembled her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Astir, she is in disgrace!” Katya’s mother declared in a fierce voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, please. It’s not as if the girl was a virgin,” Astir scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToma was so angry I thought the veins in his neck would rupture. “Do not speak of her in that way! She is an innocent!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who has let Count Dracula play with her many a time, hasn’t she? But this time it is a mere guard, not a count with a full purse to encourage you to forget about any indiscretion,” Astir decided. “I’m not about to pay you for the use of your daughter. I didn’t indulge in her feminine wiles and Enre is a man of humble means.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Astir,” I said warningly, stepping fully into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fallen angel tossed his golden hair from his face and grinned rakishly. “Why, darling Countess Dracula, how kind of you to join us. We have the most exciting drama afoot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Astir, do behave,” I chided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what your guard did?” Toma demanded, his blue eyes fastening upon me. “He defiled her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess, help me!” Katya wailed. Her face was swollen from crying and her hair clung to her wet face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Toma, what do you desire?” I asked, making a great show of opening my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This time she could be with child!” Katya’s mother cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True,” Astir agreed. “A vampire’s seed is dead, but Enre is a fine human beast, virile and potent!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya’s mother gasped as her daughter cried louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Astir, please!” I scolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is not enough for you to pay,” Toma shouted. “I will be disgraced for her sin in the eyes of the church and this town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And everyone in this hotel if you keep shouting,” Astir pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t even know if she’s with child,” I said in a much calmer tone. I was trying to keep my temper, but it was not an easy task with all the shouting and crying in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her sin is on you! You brought that man here and he seduced her!” Toma shoved his fair hair back from his flushed face with a one meaty hand and glowered at me. “You have brought a great sin down on me and my family!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As if it is not a sin for you to give succor to vampires?” Astir asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Astir, I suggest you remove yourself from the room,” I said tersely. “The sooner this is resolved, the better, and you are only making things worse. Now go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see why we should pay for the harlot. I certainly did not amuse myself with her. Though you did take a sip or two, didn’t you?” Astir tapped his throat, winking. “Perhaps we should pay that tab and be off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess, please help me!” Flailing about in her mother’s arms, Katya fought to come to me while her mother restrained her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or should we also pay for all the times she lay with your husband on previous trips? Or did he already pay?” Astir asked Toma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnraged, the man could barely speak as he clenched his fists and raised them in Astir’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Astir, leave,” I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Astir tucked back his curls, straightened his cuffs, made a great show of donning his coat, then left the room. I shut the door behind him. Now that Astir was gone, Toma seemed a tad calmer, though Katya continued to wail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That boy must marry her and take her with him,” Toma declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we must have a dowry,” his wife added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Astir asked a very important question. How many times has she lain with my husband without you ever saying a word?” I queried, my gaze cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya’s parents remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many times did you allow her to come to my room knowing what I needed from her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya’s mother averted her eyes as Toma drew in a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This time is different,” Toma said in a much calmer voice, “for she could be with child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you interrupted their interlude?” I lifted my eyebrows. “Didn’t you?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-17.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
