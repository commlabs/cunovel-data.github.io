Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis. The king, being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for Jupiter\u0027s stay with the ?thiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.\n\u003cbr\u003e Achilles\u0027 wrath, to Greece the direful spring\n\u003cbr\u003e Of woes unnumber\u0027d, heavenly

spread,44\n\u003cbr\u003e And heap\u0027d the camp with mountains of the dead;\n\u003cbr\u003e The king of men his reverent priest defied,45\n\u003cbr\u003e And for the king\u0027s offence the people died.\n\u003cbr\u003e For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain\n\u003cbr\u003e His captive daughter from the victor\u0027s chain.\n\u003cbr\u003e Suppliant the venerable father

He sued to all, but chief implored for grace\n\u003cbr\u003e The brother-kings, of Atreus\u0027 royal race46\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown\u0027d,\n\u003cbr\u003e And

son of Jove.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,\n\u003cbr\u003e The priest to reverence, and release the fair.\n\u003cbr\u003e Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,\n\u003cbr\u003e Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,\n\u003cbr\u003e Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king

he prays,\n\u003cbr\u003e The god who darts around the world his rays.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona\u0027s line,47\n\u003cbr\u003e Thou guardian power of Cilla the

Chalcas thus replied;\n\u003cbr\u003e Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,\n\u003cbr\u003e That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,\n\u003cbr\u003e The past, the present, and the future knew:\n\u003cbr\u003e Uprising slow, the venerable sage\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would\u0027st thou
