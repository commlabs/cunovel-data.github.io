He\u0027d used his head, and his legs, dashing away from the bungalow in Gordonston, hopping fences between the pretty backyards back to his own house, to the phone. And to nine-one-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d given names, the address, the situation. En route to Savannah\u0027s east side, Phoebe listened to the replay of the emergency call and thought the boy had the makings of a good cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s got them sitting around the kitchen table. Mr. Brinker does. Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrinker, Jessie, Aaron, even the baby. Urn, Penny, in her high chair. He\u0027s got a gun. I think he\u0027s got two guns. Jessie\u0027s crying. Jesus, you gotta do something. She had more information. It came rolling in as she and Sykes sped toward the pretty neighborhood. Stuart Brinker, age forty-three, associate professor. Father of three-Jessica, sixteen, Aaron, twelve, and Penelope, two. Recently separated from his wife of eighteen years, Katherine, thirty-nine, art teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes after the nine-one-one, Phoebe walked through the barricade forming the outer perimeter. The media was already doing stand-ups outside the barricades. There were some shouts in her direction from reporters. Phoebe ignored them, signaled to one of the uniforms. \"Lieutenant MacNamara and Detective Sykes, negotiators. What\u0027s the situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four hostages, three minor children. HT\u0027s got them in the living room now.\" He gestured toward the tidy white bungalow with azaleas blooming pink and white in the front yard. \"Curtains closed on all the windows there. We can\u0027t get a visual. HT\u0027s got a couple of handguns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shots fired. First responder\u0027s been talking to him off and on. The word I get is the guy\u0027s really polite, but isn\u0027t doing a lot of communicating at this point. Kid who called it in\u0027s over there with his mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe glanced over, saw the gangly teenage boy sitting on the ground, head in his hands. A woman sat beside him, her arm hooked firmly over his shoulder, her face pale as wax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sykes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ve got him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe moved on toward communications, and the edge of the inner perimeter, as Sykes walked to the boy. \"Lieutenant MacNamara, negotiator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation came fast now. Tactical had the house surrounded, the near neighbors evacuated. Sharpshooters were moving into positions. \"He won\u0027t talk much,\" the first responder told her. \"I\u0027ve been trying to keep the line open with him. He sounds tired. Sad, not angry. He and the wife are separated-her idea, he says. Last time I got him to talk, he thanked me for calling before hanging up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, stand by.\" She studied the log, the situation board, then pulled out her notebook as she picked up the phone. \"Let\u0027s get him back on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered on the third ring, and his voice was brutally weary. \"Please, is this necessary? I want some time with my family. Some quiet, uninterrupted time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Brinker? This is Phoebe MacNamara. I\u0027m a negotiator with the Savannah-Chatham Police Department. I\u0027d like to help. How is everyone in there? Everybody okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re fine, thank you. Now please, leave us alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Brinker, I understand you want to be with your family. You sound as if you love them very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do. I love my family. Families need to be together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want your family to be together, I understand. Why don\u0027t you bring them out now? All of you together. I\u0027d like you to put your weapons down now, Mr. Brinker, and come out with your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do that. I\u0027m very sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell me why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my house. This is the only way we can be together. I thought about this carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanned out, not impulse, she thought as she made notes. Not anger but sorrow. \"You sound tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I\u0027m very tired. I\u0027ve done my best, but it\u0027s never quite good enough. It\u0027s exhausting to never be quite good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve done your best. It\u0027s hard, don\u0027t you think, to make important decisions when you\u0027re tired and upset? You sound tired and upset. I\u0027d like to help you, Mr. Brinker. I\u0027d like to help you work this all out so you can make the right decision for your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I painted this living room. Kate picked the color. I didn\u0027t like it too yellow-and we argued. Remember, Kate? We fought over the yellow paint right there in the Home Depot, and she won. So I painted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was right. It\u0027s sunny in here. She was right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiving Room, Phoebe wrote on her pad, circling it. \"You did the painting. I\u0027m terrible at painting. Can\u0027t get the cutting-in part. Have you and your family lived here long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten years. It\u0027s a good place to raise children. That\u0027s what we thought. Good neighborhood, good schools. We need a bigger house, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your family\u0027s grown.\" Family, family, family, Phoebe told herself. Focus on family. \"How many children do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three. We have three. We didn\u0027t plan on Penny. We couldn\u0027t really afford...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Penny\u0027s your youngest, then? How old is Penny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two, Penny\u0027s two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe heard an excited child\u0027s voice call: \"Daddy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that her I hear?\" Now she heard a choked sob from Brinker and kept talking. \"She sounds very sweet. I have a little girl. She\u0027s seven, and I just wonder where the years went. I love her more than anything. She sure keeps me busy, though. I imagine your family keeps you very busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve done my best. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s not enough. If I\u0027d gotten the full professorship, we could afford a bigger house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound discouraged. It must be hard. You have an older daughter, is that right? Jessie, and then a boy in the middle, Aaron. Your wife, Kate, and you must be very proud. Still, it\u0027s a lot of work. I understand that. A lot of worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed that professorship. I needed tenure. I needed Kate to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of past tense, and the despair, set off alarms. \"Tell me what you need Kate to understand, Mr. Brinker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I can\u0027t do any more than I can do, or be more than I can be. But it\u0027s not enough. I\u0027m the husband, I\u0027m the father. I\u0027m supposed to make it work. But things fall apart; the center cannot hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Yeats, isn\u0027t it?\" She closed her eyes, hoping she hadn\u0027t made a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a beat of silence. \"Yes. You know Yeats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some. And I think sometimes that\u0027s true, things do fall apart, or seem to. The center can\u0027t always hold it all. But I also think things can be rebuilt, or reformed, and the center shored up again to hold it all differently. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once it falls, it\u0027s not the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the same, but still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family\u0027s fallen apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027re still there, Mr. Brinker, and I hear how much you love them, every one of them. I don\u0027t believe you want to hurt them. Or that you want to hurt them by hurting yourself. You\u0027re the father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weekend father. Perish instead of publish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you\u0027re discouraged, and you\u0027re sad. But you\u0027re not ready to stop trying. You and Kate, eighteen years together, and those beautiful children you\u0027ve made together. You don\u0027t want to stop trying. You love them too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t want me anymore. What\u0027s the point? We made it all together. I thought we should end it all together. Here, in our home. The five of us, going together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThought we should. This time his use of past tense told her they might be turning a corner. \"The five of you need to come out together, Mr. Brinker. Your children sound frightened. I can hear them crying now. You and your wife are their parents, you and your wife are responsible for keeping them safe and well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to do anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at your children, Mr. Brinker, look at your wife. I don\u0027t believe anything\u0027s more precious to you. You don\u0027t want to hurt them. You can make the center hold. Look at the yellow walls. You gave them that sunny room, even when you weren\u0027t sure it would work. Put the guns down now, Mr. Brinker. Put them down, and bring your family out. You said you\u0027d done your best. I believe you. Now, I believe you\u0027ll do your best again, and put the guns down. Bring your wife and your babies out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going to happen? I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to help you. You and your family. Will you come out with your family now? It\u0027s the right thing to do for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go into the black without them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to go into the black at all. Will you put the guns down, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Can you listen to me now, Mr. Brinker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the guns down. Please put them down and step away from them. Will you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. All right. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrote Coming out. Surrendering. Signaled that message to Tactical command. \"It\u0027s going to be all right. Did you put the guns down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I put them on the shelf. High, where Penny can\u0027t reach them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the right thing to do. I want you to come to the front door. You and your family. Don\u0027t be afraid. No one\u0027s going to hurt you. I need you to keep your hands up, just so everyone can see you did the right thing and put the guns down. There\u0027ll be police outside, but no one\u0027s going to hurt you. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right. Will you bring your family out, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I... I can\u0027t keep my hands up and talk on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe closed her eyes, took a breath. \"That\u0027s fine. Why don\u0027t you give the phone to Kate now? And you can all come outside together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Kate? You need to take this call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God. God.\" The woman\u0027s voice wrenched out the words. \"We\u0027re coming out. He doesn\u0027t have a gun. Please, please, don\u0027t shoot. Don\u0027t hurt him. Don\u0027t hurt him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s going to hurt him. No one\u0027s going to get hurt today.\" When they came out, what struck Phoebe right to the bone was the sound of the little girl crying for her daddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn what had become his workroom, he drank cold, sweet tea with a small sprig of fresh mint and watched the media coverage of the crisis in Gordonston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped they\u0027d all die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t care about the Brinkers-they meant nothing to him one way or the other. But if that whining college guy put bullets in his family, then himself, Phoebe would take a hell of a hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be worth the airtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, if she took too hard a hit, he might not get the chance to pay her back, his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitch would probably slide out of it anyway, even if she fucked up and the idiot put a bullet in the brain of the fat-cheeked toddler whose picture they\u0027d shown on screen half a dozen times already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t take the blame for it, no matter how much she\u0027d earned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the tea, he sat down at his workbench. He\u0027d heard the call come through on his police scanner while he was finishing up breakfast. It had given him a hell of a lift. Guy, wife, three kids. A bloodbath like that would get lots of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been right, and on his workroom TV, he watched while the local station preempted the Today show with live at-the-scene coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027d seen Phoebe stride by the cameras, ignoring reporters in that superior, I\u0027m-so-fucking-important way of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought about putting a bullet in her brain. Oh, he\u0027d thought about it, even dreamed about it, just the way he figured Mr. College Professor was thinking about putting one into his whole stupid family. But that was too easy. That was too quick. Bang! And it\u0027s over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a much better plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept the TV on while he worked. Usually, he had the spare scanner on down here, and maybe the radio. Television was too distracting when he was working. But he considered this an exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips thinned as the reporter on screen announced the Brinker family had come out, safe and sound, that the asshole surrendered peacefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pulled that one off, didn\u0027t you?\" he muttered to himself as he turned screws. \"Yeah, that one was easy. Didn\u0027t have to break a sweat, did you? Nice family, nice neighborhood. Just some stupid shit looking for some attention. You got them out just fine, didn\u0027t you? Phoebe. \" He had to stop, put his tools down, because the anger, the rage, made his hands shake. He wanted a cigarette. Actually yearned for one. But he\u0027d made himself quit. It was a matter of willpower, and practicality. He didn\u0027t need crutches. He couldn\u0027t afford to need crutches. He couldn\u0027t even afford the rage. Cold blood, he reminded himself. Cool head. When payback came, he\u0027d need those, and a strong body, a clear purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he closed his eyes and willed everything inside him to slow, to still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her voice that had his eyes opening again, had them burning toward the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stuart Brinker surrendered peacefully. His wife and their children weren\u0027t harmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant MacNamara, as hostage negotiator, how did you convince Professor Brinker to surrender to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I listened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass flew across the room, shattered against the set before he realized it had left his hand. Amber rain dripped down over Phoebe\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave to work on that, he told himself. Have to work on that control. Won\u0027t get the job done flying off the handle. No sir. But he smiled as the rivulets of tea slid down Phoebe\u0027s face. He imagined them red, long thin rivers of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it pleased him, he was able to pick up his tools again with a steady hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to work on the timer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It got to me. Some of them do, more than others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter shift, Phoebe sat with Liz over a couple of glasses of wine in Swifty\u0027s. It was too early for music, so the booth was a quiet corner, an island to sink into and unwind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe started to speak, then shook her head. \"I didn\u0027t mean to talk shop. We should talk shoes or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought this pair a couple weeks ago? Pumps, leopard-skin design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what I was thinking. Where am I going to wear leopardskin pumps? Anyway, we\u0027ll get to that. Tell me about the incident. I know how it is,\" Liz went on. \"I talk to a lot of rape victims, to a lot of kids who\u0027ve been sexually abused. And sometimes it gets to you more than others. You get it out, or it roots. So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kids. You have to try not to think about them as kids. Just hostages. But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. And in this case, part of the key to talking him down. He loved them. You could hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the question is, how do you hold what you love at gunpoint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re broken. Something was broken inside him. He wasn\u0027t mad, there wasn\u0027t any rage in him. It wasn\u0027t payback or punishment. It can be more volatile when it\u0027s not about payback. Maybe that\u0027s part of what got to me, too. I hear this guy, I hear him standing on the edge of an abyss. And he doesn\u0027t believe he can come back from it-that he deserves to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why take the family, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s nothing without them. They\u0027re essential to who he is. He doesn\u0027t want to die without them. So...\" She lifted her wine. \"Altogether now.\" She drank, blew out a breath. \"He\u0027s been depressed for more than a year, and things have been slipping away from him. Career, marriage, both on pretty shaky ground. Wife wants a bigger house, oldest daughter wants a car of her own, he gets thumbs-down on the full professorship. Stuff you handle or fight about. But he just sank down, and kept sinking. The wife\u0027s so busy taking care of the kids and the house because he\u0027s barely able to get out of bed. She gets fed up, kicks him out. \u0027Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.\u0027 He couldn\u0027t hold it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave them a chance to try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Well. Nobody died. You listen good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of what we both do is listen.\" Liz tapped her glass to Phoebe\u0027s. \"And we\u0027d better be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you always want to be a cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to be a rock-and-roll star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz laughed. \"I was actually in a band for a couple of years when I was in college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kidding? What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got pipes, sister.\" Liz wagged her thumb at her throat. \"And I was crazy in love with the lead guitar. We had plans. The kind you make at twenty and aren\u0027t ever going anywhere. Big, splashy plans. Which we made when we weren\u0027t screwing like bunnies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"College.\" Phoebe sighed. \"Those were the days. What happened to Lead Guitar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He dumped me. No, that\u0027s not fair, or accurate. He backed away, rapidly. I got raped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My turn to make the beer run. There was a place just a couple blocks from where we were living. Party time, all the time. You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in the parking lot when they jumped me. Two of them, laughing like loons. Seriously high. They dragged me into the back of a van, took turns with me while a third one drove. Then they switched off so he could have a go. I don\u0027t know how many times, because I zoned out after the first round. Then they just tossed me out on the side of the road. Cruiser picked me up. I was just stumbling along, clothes torn and bloody, in shock, hysterical. The whole ball. And the cops spotted me.\" She drank to wet her throat. \"Well. They got them, all three of them. I paid attention, until I had to go under. I paid attention. I had descriptions, and I made all three of those motherfuckers in lineup. Hardest thing I ever did, to stand there and look at them through that glass. And Lead Guitar? He couldn\u0027t handle it. Couldn\u0027t look at me, couldn\u0027t touch me, couldn\u0027t be with me. Too much for his head, he said. I didn\u0027t want to be a rock-and-roll star anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long they get? The motherfuckers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still in.\" Liz smiled for the first time. \"Stupid bastards took me across the state line into South Carolina. Raped me in two states, had coke in the van, all three had sheets, two were on parole. Anyway, I gave up the band and turned to the glamorous world of law enforcement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Music\u0027s loss, our gain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, shop\u0027s closed. Tell me about the guy with the great ass. You two an item?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We seem to be something, but I\u0027m not sure what.\" Thoughtfully, Phoebe propped an elbow on the table, nested her chin in her palm. \"I\u0027m out of practice. Kid, job, raw spots from failed marriage. He\u0027s so damn cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed. How\u0027s the sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe snorted out a surprised laugh. \"You get right to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Healthy sex is one of life\u0027s great entertainments. Take it from somebody who sees too much of the other kind. But if you don\u0027t want to share-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually.\" She hadn\u0027t made time for a female friend of her own age in too long. Now, Phoebe leaned forward, lowered her voice. \"The other n i g h\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a condensed version of her visit to Duncan\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He stopped? You\u0027re about to go for the gold right out on the veranda-which, let me insert, is very sexy-and he stops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty seconds more, that\u0027s all it would\u0027ve taken.\" Phoebe did a test roll of her bad shoulder. \"If I hadn\u0027t moved the wrong way... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romantic and sexy. I mean, God, how many guys are going to shut it down at that point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to need a note from my sister-in-law to close the deal. Private duty nurse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I have him when you\u0027re done? No, seriously, Phoebe, when you two get that next thirty seconds, it\u0027s going to be memorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking. Listen, I\u0027ve got to get home. My kid. But the next time, we\u0027ll explore your sex life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the moment, we could do that over a bag of peanuts in the break room. Maybe Cute Guy has a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe got out of the car just as Lorelei Tiffany clipped up with her incredibly silly dog. Tonight\u0027s leash was candy pink, to coordinate with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Tiffany\u0027s ensemble-heels, pillbox hat, waist-cinching jacket and thigh-gripping capris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evening, Miz Tiffany. How are you and Maximillian Dufree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have ourselves a nice stroll in the park.\" Mrs. Tiffany tipped down her rhinestone-studded glasses to peer at Phoebe. \"You just getting home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m running a little later than usual today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got your car back, I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. For now. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to give it a decent burial soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My uncle Lucius once buried an entire Cadillac DeVille, complete with passengers, in a soybean field outside of Macon. So they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm, that must\u0027ve been some job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Uncle Lucius for you. He never quibbled about getting his hands dirty. I saw you on TV today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? There was some trouble over in Gordonston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crazy man going to murder his whole family in a three-bedroom bungalow. I saw it. You\u0027re going to be on TV, honey, you need to dress for it. Bright colors do the trick, and more blusher. You don\u0027t want to look all washed-out and dull on the TV, now do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOddly, Phoebe felt washed-out and dull standing there on the wide sidewalk while Maximillian Dufree peed lavishly on the trunk of the near live oak. \"I guess not, but I wasn\u0027t expecting to be on TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Expect the unexpected.\" Mrs. Tiffany wagged her elaborately ringed index finger. \"You remember that, and always carry your blusher, you\u0027ll do fine. You get yourself on TV like that, you might just catch yourself a husband. A man likes a woman with pink in her cheeks. And a nice, soft bosom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep that in mind. You and Maximillian Dufree have a nice walk now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Phoebe started up the walk to what she considered the relative sanity of home, she heard Mrs. Tiffany trill out with a \"And good evening to you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back, saw the man strolling by. He tapped the brim of his ball cap toward Mrs. Tiffany. He wore a camera strapped crossways over his dark windbreaker and resting at his hip. A tourist, Phoebe thought idly, though there was something vaguely familiar about him. Since he was a man, Mrs. Tiffany had to put her flirt on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmused, Phoebe continued up the steps. She didn\u0027t see him pivot, raise the camera, frame her in. When something tickled at the base of her spine, she glanced back. But he was strolling casually away. She could hear him whistle as he walked, something slow and sad and as vaguely familiar as he\u0027d been himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t say why the sound of it gave her a chill. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-12.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
