There was still time to talk—a chance for peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePonder shook his head. \"Anyhow this guy—my target—had married the daughter of one of the local officials. I thought the father-in-law would be pretty ticked when a whole armored column showed up on his doorstep. But the next thing I knew, I was in his living room, sipping tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePonder tapped the ash from his cigar. \"We talked about nothing for a few minutes—just got comfortable. Then when his wife was pouring me a second cup, I got down to it: \u0027We\u0027re looking for so-and-so, do you know where we can find him, we don\u0027t mean your daughter any harm, etcetera, etcetera.\u0027 And he looks me right in the eye …\" Ponder paused and stared out the Warthog\u0027s sloped windshield. \"He looks me in the eye and says: \u0027Someday we will win. No matter what it takes.\u0027\" The Captain flexed his prosthetic, pantomiming his memories. \"Then he put his arm around the target\u0027s wife—his own daughter—and raised it up like this … took me a second to realize he had a grenade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery didn\u0027t know what to say, except that, having inherited the Insurrection from men like Ponder, he\u0027d seen things at least as surprising, at least as tragic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it was a bluff. This guy was dedicated to the cause, no doubt. But kill his whole family? Wasn\u0027t gonna happen.\" Ponder pulled the half-smoked cigar from his teeth and ground it into the dash. \"One of my snipers thought different. Put a hasty round through the wall of his house, tore the guy in half. But he pulled the pin on reflex.\" The Captain shrugged. \"I dove to cover the blast. Things got worse from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTight space, jumpy soldiers; Avery knew worse had meant a lot of civilian casualties, some very angry top brass and—adding insult to injury—Ponder taking a two-step drop in rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they wanted me to take an early retirement. But I stuck with it,\" the Captain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took a bunch of lousy billets and worked my way up to CMT. Thought I\u0027d left the Insurrection behind me.\" He shot Avery a look that was more inquisitive than accusatory. \"Then along came the two of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Avery was at a loss for words. But Ponder was soon lost in more memories from that terrible day long ago, and for a while both men resumed their silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the apple orchards, Avery saw JOTUNs—a pair of monstrous pickers large enough to engulf whole trees with their agitating arms. He had overheard Healy arguing with one of his recruits about the exact number of JOTUNs on Harvest. The Corpsman refused to believe there were three JOTUNs for every person—almost a million machines—until the recruit had explained he was counting all the different versions: the smallest aerial crop dusters to the six- wheeled beasts like the ones in the orchard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny,\" Ponder said in a way that made clear he didn\u0027t think it was the least bit so. \"But at first I missed it: my men, the combat, all of it. Took me years to realize how crazy that was— that I\u0027d been damn lucky to get out when I did. Before things got really bad, and I made a mistake that got a lot more people killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery nodded his head, although he might as well have said: I know exactly what you mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now the Bifrost had begun to rise before them. They were still an hour away from the limestone escarpment, but squinting his eyes, Avery could just see dark switchbacks carving back and forth across its face that would take them up to Utgard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn either side of the switchbacks, separated by hundreds of kilometers, were two maglev train lines—thick monorails that angled down from the top of the Bifrost to meet the Ida, far out in the orchards. Avery saw a long train of cargo containers glide down the southern line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train seemed to move too quickly for the containers\u0027 size, and Avery realized they must be empty—on their way to a depot where hundreds of JOTUNs waited with fresh-picked loads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe FLEETCOM decided you needed a break?\" Ponder offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Avery said. It was as good an explanation as any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why not start tonight? Have a drink, dance with a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery smiled despite himself. \"That an order, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePonder laughed and slapped his artificial arm on his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Staff Sergeant. Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Avery pulled the Warthog into the curved drive of Harvest\u0027s Parliament building, he knew a lot more about Captain Ponder. How fighting the Insurrection had forced him to miss his eldest son\u0027s wedding and the birth of his first grandchild—precious occasions he missed much more than his arm. As they dismounted, buttoned their coats\u0027 brass buttons, and pulled on their black-billed dress caps, Avery realized he not only trusted but had a great deal more respect for the man who wore his CO\u0027s uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Parliament\u0027s lobby was thick with partygoers: men in pastel, seersucker suits; women in ruffled, scoop neck gowns—fashions that were already out of style in core-world salons, but had only just taken hold of Harvest\u0027s provincial high society. Some of the guests gawked and whispered as Avery and Ponder passed. And it struck the Staff Sergeant that they were the first marines—the first soldiers—some of the guests had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as they threaded their way up a crowded granite staircase to the ballroom, some of the curious gazes turned cold. We might be a new sight, Avery grimaced, but not necessarily a welcome one. It seemed the UNSC\u0027s handling of the Insurrection wasn\u0027t any more popular on Harvest than it was anywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nils Thune,\" someone bellowed from the landing at the top of the staircase. A thick hand shot out from a great swath of red- and white-striped fabric. \"You must be Captain Ponder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Governor,\" Ponder paused on the top step and saluted. Then he extended his hand. \"It\u0027s an honor to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likewise, of course!\" Thune\u0027s grip was so strong he practically pulled Ponder up onto the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I introduce you to one of my men? Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThune released Ponder\u0027s hand and offered it to Avery. \"Well, Johnson?\" Thune\u0027s red beard parted in a broad, toothsome grin. \"What do you think of our planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery had a strong grip, but Thune\u0027s was immobilizing. His hand possessed the kind of strength one got from years of farming the old-fashioned way—without assistance from a fleet of hulking automatons. Avery guessed correctly that despite his vigor, the Governor was well into his sixties—that he\u0027d been one of the first colonists to land on Harvest. \"Reminds me of home, sir.\" Avery grimaced. \"I grew up on Earth, Chicago Industrial Zone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThune released Avery\u0027s hand and stabbed his thumb happily to his chest. \"Minnesota! My mother\u0027s and father\u0027s side both, far back as I can remember.\" Widening his smile he ushered the marines toward the doorway of a brightly lit ballroom. \"You\u0027re in good company, Staff Sergeant. Most everyone around here\u0027s from the Midwest—pulled up stakes when the soil went bad. Of course none of us knew just how much better things would be once we got to Harvest!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Governor snatched a champagne flute from a passing waiter and downed it in one gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way!\" He shuffled sideways through the ballroom doorway, his girth doing at least as much to part the crowd as any deference to his office. \"And stay close! The show\u0027s about to start, and I want you two front and center!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery shot Ponder a confused look. But the Captain simply plunged into Thune\u0027s gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery followed just as the crowd drew back upon itself, practically sucking him into the ballroom. Doing their best not to step on any toes, the marines followed Thune to one of the many glass-paned doors in the ballroom\u0027s eastern wall that led to a broad balcony overlooking the Parliament\u0027s gardens—and beyond that, Utgard\u0027s mall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping up beside Thune against the balcony\u0027s waist-high granite railing, Avery saw that the park was full of revelers. Light-globes tugging at their tethers in the twilight breeze illuminated knots of families sitting on brightly colored picnic blankets. Hardly any of the mall was left uncovered, and Avery was certain the vast majority of the planet\u0027s three hundred thousand residents were in attendance. But for what, he still wasn\u0027t quite sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rol!\" Thune\u0027s shout rang painfully loud in Avery\u0027s ears. \"Over here!\" The Governor waved a hand above his head, but this wasn\u0027t necessary. Thune was taller than anyone on the balcony, Avery included, and the mop of thick, red and gray hair that covered his head was impossible to miss. Avery craned his neck toward the ballroom in time to see the Governor\u0027s somato-typical opposite slide out from the jostling crowd; a short, balding man whose elderly frame barely filled his light gray linen suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rol Pedersen,\" Thune announced. \"My Attorney General.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a fancy way to say lawyer.\" Pedersen smiled modestly through his thin, pursed lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t offer Avery or Ponder his hand, but not for any lack of courtesy; the jubilant crowd had begun to flow from the ballroom to the railing, crushing the Attorney General\u0027s arms firmly to his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rol\u0027s about as formal as we get out here,\" Thune explained. \"Stickler for details. He\u0027s the one who handled all the negotiations with the CA about us raising a militia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically.\" Pedersen\u0027s eyes twinkled as he raised one of his white eyebrows. \"I formally accepted their demand that we have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the sky erupted with fireworks, filling the gaps between the Tiara\u0027s seven elevators with multicolored blossoms. Jutting up from Utgard\u0027s skyline, the strands shone bronze in Epsilon Indi\u0027s failing light. As the showering sparks rippled the air around them, they appeared to vibrate, like plucked strings in a giant\u0027s harp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, everyone!\" Thune roared as the last of the fireworks erupted in a smoky, blue- green cloud. \"Get set!\" The Governor put his hands to his ears, as did everyone else on the balcony except Avery and Ponder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mass driver,\" Pedersen explained. \"We fire it every solstice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, the towers around the mall went dark as the city\u0027s electrical grid lost power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bright flash beyond the Tiara\u0027s central number-four strand, and a moment later a shockwave hammered the mall, flattening the light globes and sending the picnickers squealing after flying napkins and bowled-over children. On the balcony, women shrieked in gleeful fright as they clutched their billowing dresses; men made a gallant show of uncapping their ears as a sonic boom pealed past the Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurrah!\" Thune shouted, starting a round of applause that echoed a similar outburst from the picnickers on the mall. \"Well done, Mack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s mighty kind, Governor.\" The AI replied from Thune\u0027s COM pad, hidden somewhere in his vast jacket. \"I aim to please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of which,\" Thune said, heading away from the railing. \"How close did you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePedersen freed a hand and pointed after Thune, letting the two marines know they were expected to follow. This time the Governor led them to the far end of the ballroom where a group of children—girls with satin bows on their dresses and boys in shiny vests and shoes— packed tight around a circular table topped with a cornucopia of fruits and vegetables. A silver holo-projector was centered in a wreath of leafy vines and deep purple grape clusters. On top of that stood Mack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missed by a mile,\" the AI said, rubbing the back of its neck with a grimy handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, more like fifty kilometers. But I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll say something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt. No doubt,\" Thune chuckled. \"Listen, I\u0027d like you to meet Captain Ponder and Staff Sergeant Johnson. UNSC Marines. Here to raise a militia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mack. Agricultural operations.\" Mack touched the brim of his cowboy hat. Then, nodding toward the balcony and the mass driver somewhere beyond, \"Same as the navy\u0027s big guns. Just a little less kick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Ponder deadpanned, \"there\u0027s a reason we only fire those in space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMass drivers were a relatively simple, cheap solution for boosting objects from a planet\u0027s surface into orbit. Typically built on large, flexible gimbles, their linked, magnetic loops could be charged, aimed, and fired with very little automation—with a simple computer rather than an AI. But drivers had one major disadvantage: limited throw-weight. Which meant that while Harvest\u0027s driver worked well during the first decade after the colony\u0027s founding (when its primary role was to send carefully packaged nuclear waste on a collision course with Epsilon Indi), for the planet to meet its full export potential, it needed to be replaced with a high- capacity lift system such as the Tiara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriver technology was alive and well in the navy, however, in the form of Mass Accelerator Cannon. So-called MAC frigates and cruisers were basically moveable mass drivers—ships designed around the weapons\u0027 long, electromagnetic coils. The technology was similar to that of the M99 Stanchion rifle. But whereas the M99\u0027s light, semi-ferrous rounds were only a few millimeters long, a MAC slug was more than ten meters end-to-end, weighed one-hundred- sixty metric tons, and packed enough punch to penetrate the navy\u0027s thickest Titanium-A armor plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Space?\" Thune grumbled dismissively. \"Those things even make noise in zero-gee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re inside a MAC ship when the cannon fires?\" Ponder raised his hands wide around his head, simulating a deafening boom. \"I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re a religious man, Governor. But it\u0027s a little like a church bell—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" The Governor beamed. \"Lutheran! Born and raised!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePedersen sighed in mock protest. \"If had known you were going to bring up religion, Captain—as Attorney General—I would have counseled a less contentious topic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I was about to tell a story …\" Mack added, loud enough for all the children to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young crowd cheered as a holographic representation of a bustling, Wild West main street appeared behind Mack. A group of masked outlaws rushed from a bank, firing their six- shooters and spooking the horses of a passing stagecoach. The children oohed and ahhed. Mack pulled a sheriff\u0027s star out of his hip pocket and pinned it to his chest. \"Might want to take the sermon to the saloon.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-contact-harvest-halo-5/page-13.html","bookId":1637,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:24 PM"}
