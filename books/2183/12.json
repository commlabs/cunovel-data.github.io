It\u0027s freezing and there isn\u0027t any air. If I can\u0027t construct a shell around myself, and soon, I\u0027m finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI search for magic, but there\u0027s nothing I can make use of. This zone of lights contains even less magical energy than there was on Earth. I thrash about like a fish on dry land, lips shut, eyes bulging. I feel my skin tighten from the cold, but that doesn\u0027t bother me. I\u0027ll suffocate long before I freeze to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my lungs strain for air that isn\u0027t there, my limbs go still and a calm wave spreads through me. In a way this is fitting. I was always a lonely child. I often felt out of place, not in sync with the people around me. Now I\u0027m going to die in true isolation, more alone than any human has ever been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gloomy mist crosses my eyes. I think it\u0027s the shades of death drawing over my face, but then I blink and realize it\u0027s a dark green window that has opened ahead of me. As I stare at it numbly, a ball of light shoots through and envelops me from head to toe. I\u0027ve just enough time to marvel at the warmth it brings. Then my eyelids flutter and I fall unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awake on a grey, cold, ashen world. I sit up, groaning. My skin is blistered. Parts feel raw. But I\u0027m alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething moves nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Art?\" I call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" A tall black man steps into view. He\u0027s fat, with very dark skin, dressed in an expensive-looking suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widen. \"Raz?\" I gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only in appearance,\" the man says solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\" I start to rise but pain prevents me. Grimacing, I frown at the fat man. Raz Warlo was a Disciple. I met him when I first joined Beranabus. He was killed during the quest to find my baby brother. \"Why change?\" I wheeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one you knew as Art is dead,\" Raz says. \"Although shapes mean nothing to us, we know you need them to make sense of the universe. We felt it would be easier for you if I took a different form.\" He looks down at himself and frowns. \"The suit was a difficult touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened back there?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The panels of the Kah-Gash reacted to your presence,\" Raz says. \"The demons attacked. We managed to get you out before they killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the panels? Did they stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fact that we still exist makes me think so,\" Raz says dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod slowly, then clear my throat. \"Art sacrificed himself to save me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you placed your life at risk by coming after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I groan. \"Why take me to the Crux and risk your lives for my sake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will become clear very soon,\" Raz says and nods at a rock behind me. \"That is a lodestone. It is the reason I brought you to this world. I suggest you use its power to heal yourself before we continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I focus, I realize there\u0027s a strong current of magic flowing around me. I tap into it gratefully and set to work on my wounds, patching up the holes burned in my flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m sealing the last of the gashes, Raz looks around at the dead land, then says, \"Did you ever plan to have children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question throws me and I squint at him. \"I hadn\u0027t given it much thought. Probably not. It\u0027s hard to bring up a child when you\u0027re busy battling demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Old Creatures can\u0027t reproduce,\" Raz says. \"It didn\u0027t matter in the original universe, since we were immortal. That changed when the Kah-Gash fractured. Now every creature ages. We are captives of time and the price of our captivity is death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Raz speaks, I stand and stretch. My stomach rumbles. I\u0027m ravenous and thirsty, but there\u0027s nothing to eat or drink, so I do my best to ignore the cries of my deprived body and focus on the Old Creature\u0027s lecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We accepted our mortality,\" Raz continues, \"but the Demonata craved a return to the way things were. They wanted to live forever. So they set about thwarting the hold of death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as the new universes exist, death will claim us all,\" Raz says. \"But if those universes are eradicated... if the Kah-Gash is reassembled and the old laws are reestablished...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to tremble. \"Beranabus said the Kah-Gash could destroy a universe. But you\u0027re saying it could destroy both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The Kah-Gash could draw everything back through time to the moment of the Big Bang, eliminate all that that has happened since, and restore the original universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would happen to us?\" I gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would have never existed,\" Raz says. \"Time would be reversed. All the creatures and planets of the new universes would be wiped out. Only the Old Creatures and the Demonata would survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wouldn\u0027t you be killed too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think we would be protected, as we were when the Kah-Gash exploded. If we are correct, even the new Demonata-the spawn of the original beasts-would be spared, since they carry the genes of their parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why not us?\" I ask hollowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not our offspring,\" Raz says sadly. \"New life was created when this universe was born. We have guided many species and helped souls develop. But you are not ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must go,\" Raz says abruptly. \"You need to eat, so we will move on.\" He sets to work on the tiny patches of light in the air around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What world of wonders are we heading for now?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going to a world,\" Raz says. \"We are going to a spaceship.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-calling-the-demonata-9/page-12.html","bookId":2183,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:49:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:49:15 PM"}
