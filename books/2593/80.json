Elves? Patrick you\u0027re confusing me,\" Evelyn says. \"And I don\u0027t appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\" I\u0027m squeezing her roughly, pulling her toward the back door. \"Let\u0027s be daring for once. For just once in your life, Evelyn, be daring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops, refusing to be pulled along, and then she starts smiling, considering my offer but only slightly won over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on...\" I start whining. \"Let this be my Christmas present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh ho, I was already at Brooks Brothers and - \" she starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it. Come on, I want this,\" I say and then in a last, desperate attempt I smile flirtatiously, kissing her lightly on the lips, and add, \"Mrs. Batsman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Patrick,\" she sighs, melting. \"But what about cleanup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The midgets\u0027ll do it,\" I assure her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But someone has to oversee it, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So choose an elf. Make that one over there the elf overseer,\" I say. \"But let\u0027s go, now.\" I start pulling her toward the back door of the brownstone, her shoes squeaking as they slide across the Muscoli marble tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we\u0027re out the door, rushing down the alley adjacent to the brownstone, and I stop and peer around the corner to see if anyone we know is leaving or entering the party. We make a run for a limousine I think is Owen\u0027s, but I don\u0027t want to make Evelyn suspicious so I simply walk up to the closest one, open the door and push her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pat rick,\" she squeals, pleased. \"This is so naughty. And a limo - \" I close the door on her and walk around the car and knock on the driver\u0027s window. The driver unrolls it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I say, holding out a hand. \"Pat Bateman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver just stares, an unlit cigar clenched in his mouth, first at my outstretched hand; then at my face, then at the top of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pat Bateman,\" I repeat. \"What, ah, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe keeps looking at me. Tentatively I touch my hair to see if it\u0027s messed up or out of place and to my shock and surprise I feel two pairs of paper antlers. There are four antlers on my f**king head. I mutter, \"Oh Jesus, whoa!\" and tear them off, staring at them crumpled in my hands, horrified. I throw them on the ground, then turn back to the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So. Pat Bateman,\" I say, smoothing my hair back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah? Sid.\" He shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Sid. Mr. Owen says we can take this car, so...\" I stop, my breath steaming in the frozen air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Mr. Owen?\" Sid asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul Owen. You know,\" I say. \"Your customer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. This is Mr. Barker\u0027s limo,\" he says. \"Nice antlers though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I say, running around the limo to get Evelyn out of there before something bad happens, but it\u0027s too late. The second I open the door, Evelyn sticks her head out and squeals, \"Patrick, darling, I love it. Champagne \" - she holds up a bottle of Cristal in one hand and a gold box in the other - \"and truffles too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her arm and yank her out, mumbling by way of an explanation, under my breath, \"Wrong limo, take the truffles,\" and we head over to the next limousine. I open the door and guide Evelyn in, then move around to the front and knock on the driver\u0027s window. He unrolls it. He looks exactly like the other driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi. Pat Batsman, \" I say, holding out my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Hi. Donald Trump. My wife Ivana\u0027s in the back,\" he says sarcastically, taking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, watch it,\" I warn. \"Listen, Mr. Owen says we can take his car. I\u0027m... oh damn. I mean I\u0027m Marcus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just said your name was Pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I was wrong,\" I say sternly, staring directly at him. \"I was wrong about my name being Pat. My name is Marcus. Marcus Halberstam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re sure of this, right?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Mr. Owen said I can take his car for the night, so...\" I stop. \"You know, let\u0027s just get on with it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-80.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
