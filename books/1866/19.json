{"id":82314,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for coming with me, sweetie. I know you\u0027re busy polishing up your resume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParking her car, Taryn glanced across at her aunt, who was sitting with her best handbag on her lap in the passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spending the morning with you is tons more fun than sorting out job history and qualifications.\" Everything that reminds me how I quit a job I thought I\u0027d love. That I will never again see the man I stupidly fell in love with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn switched off the ignition, opened her door and got her thoughts on track. \"I\u0027m just wondering when you got interested in nautical themes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time for a change. I\u0027m over polished oak and tapestry upholstery. When I saw that flyer earlier this week, the stock and colors leaped out and grabbed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn checked out the run of storefronts, which paralleled a busy marina. Shielding her eyes from the sun, she inhaled the scent drifting in on a gentle saltwater breeze. Sydney was interlaced with so many gorgeous bays, but this morning, all that clear blue water stretching out toward the \"great beyond\" made her heart squeeze tight in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach day she told herself to focus on tomorrow not on yesterday. Having left Hunter Broadcasting for good, the world was her oyster. She could pursue her dream of producing; she still believed Hot Spots would appeal to a wide audience. On the other hand, just because she\u0027d worked in TV all her adult life didn\u0027t mean she wouldn\u0027t enjoy a different vocation. A job that would suit her a hundred times more, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a place that didn\u0027t remind her of Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they crossed the parking lot, Vi examined that flyer again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to this, the store\u0027s way down the other end. I only want a quick look, first up. No deposits until I\u0027ve chewed over all the options.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were passing a cafe, its display cabinet filled with rows of scrumptious-looking cakes. Taryn wasn\u0027t surprised when Vi\u0027s step slowed and she asked, \"Want to stop for a coffee before tackling the shops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I missed my caffeine hit this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that torte is calling me. I\u0027ll go on ahead for a preliminary once-over of that floor stock, you order us something nice and I\u0027ll meet you back here in ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn headed for an outside table while Vi, in her denim pedal pushers, hurried away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter consulting the menu, Taryn passed on her orders to a waitress: latte and torte for Vi, fresh seasonal berries with a Muscat cream and a flat white for her. As she sat back and drank in a view crammed with boats, of course she thought of Cole again, and of how close she\u0027d come to crumpling and inviting him back into her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now when she thought of the way he\u0027d held her that rainy day at her door - the determination of that sizzling kiss - she suffered the same doubts. What if Vi were right in her advice? If she hadn\u0027t pushed Cole away that final time, perhaps that path might have somehow opened for them again. At some stage Cole must realize he couldn\u0027t battle everyone\u0027s storms all of the time. Couldn\u0027t he cut himself some slack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t he want his own life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as Roman had said, a leopard doesn\u0027t change its spots. Cole blustered around, letting all and sundry know how indispensible he was. The kicker was, as far as she was concerned, he was special. Incredibly so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else would ever make her pulse race the way he did. When they made love, every move was perfect. Every stroke sublime. This constant gnawing she felt must fade with time but, sitting here now, remembering their amazing night on that quiet moonlit beach, she simply couldn\u0027t see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess there was the possibility she would never fall in love again. Hadn\u0027t that been true for Vi? Some people\u0027s hearts could only be given away once. With only passersby and squawking gulls for company, Taryn couldn\u0027t help imagining going through life alone...with no partner, no children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo family of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn gazed blindly at her sandals and forced herself to be positive. Common sense said she\u0027d feel so much better in three months. Probably her old self again in six. If only she could stop thinking about how wonderful his mouth had felt grazing over hers. How alive she\u0027d been when they\u0027d laughed together and had opened up. It had felt so...real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flower blew under the next table - a large red bloom that looked much like the one she admired on that island. Angling, Taryn focused on the petals, the soft scarlet plains. Was everything today meant to remind her of Cole?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout to lean over and collect that flower, Taryn tipped back as cake and berries arrived. But when the plates slid onto the tabletop, she noticed the hands that served her were male. Not uncommon. Except she recognized those hands, the bronzed corded forearms. Oh, God, she knew that watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom head to toe she began to tingle. But it couldn\u0027t be. This had to be her imagination running wild. Too much mulling had short-circuited her brain. But then that voice resonated out, drifting like a warm welcome veil over her senses and denial was simply no use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"Is there anything else I can do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs time seemed to slow, Taryn clamped shut her eyes. In a heartbeat, the island and those bittersweet memories were back. A stinging pain penetrated her ribs. How would she ever move on if he kept showing up like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her eyes, that flower was sitting on the table in front of her as if placed there by magic. The impulse to either sweep the bloom aside or hug it close was overwhelming. Her fingers itched to stroke the velvet petals, place them against her cheek and wish them all back to that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she pushed her back into the chair and bit down as a man rounded the table. When their eyes met, Taryn\u0027s stomach looped and her head began to prickle with heat, just like the tips of her breasts. In casual white trousers, rubber-soled shoes and a black short-sleeved shirt, Cole gazed down at her as his dark hair rippled in a stiffening breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice view,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed her arms. Found her voice. \"I\u0027m waiting for my aunt. She\u0027ll be back any moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded as if it were of little consequence. \"You\u0027re looking well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn didn\u0027t feel well, but she noticed that his eyes were clearer than the last time they\u0027d spoken...the last time they\u0027d kissed. And the smudges underneath had faded, too. The strong angle of his jaw was clean-shaven and his expression reflected a completely relaxed air she hadn\u0027t seen since their time in the Pacific. Just how had he come to be here this morning, serving her cake when surely he had business to sort?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if reading her mind, he explained, \"I bought a boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d bite. \"Plan to do some cruising around the harbor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I was planning to set sail for far deeper waters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ulani.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn blinked. Her Hot Spots destination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a yearning to see if those turtles hatched and broke out on their own. Must be hell sharing that kind of space with so many siblings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him sideways. Really? \"What happened to all your responsibilities? Has your dad\u0027s assailant been caught?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, but I have every faith in Brandon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not worried something might happen while you\u0027re gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll worry. But no more than my brothers and sister. Teagan says she wants to come out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn started. \"You talked to your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"It was really good to catch up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s happening with Tate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s safe and well. All set to fly over to stay with Dex. I\u0027ll stay and keep him company until he does. He hasn\u0027t stopped talking about Disneyland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about your work commitments? The way you spoke, your L.A. section\u0027s a hairbreadth away from closing its doors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well,\" Cole tugged his ear, \"I may have overreacted. I was wrong not to give Dex more credit. Wynn, too. Truth is they\u0027re doing their best in hard times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn couldn\u0027t believe she was hearing it. \"What brought you to that conclusion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A great big dose of \u0027appreciate what you have because it could be gone tomorrow.\u0027\" He searched her eyes. \"Taryn, I need to apologize. You were right. I\u0027d already made my mind up about your show and nothing could change it. But I should have taken a chance. I should have taken a chance on, and believed in, a lot of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his gaze intensified, Taryn\u0027s stomach muscles kicked. Pressing a palm against the spot, she switched the focus back onto Cole and this left-field decision to sail off into the sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your football contract?\" she asked. That was supposed to be critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I finally told Finlay he could jam it,\" he said. \"We signed the next day. We\u0027re set there for the next five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn was slowly shaking her head. Cole was walking away, just like that? It couldn\u0027t be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have the everyday running of the place. So many things to oversee - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roman\u0027s been given a permanent promotion. He has enough experience in the role. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll do a great job as Hunter Broadcasting\u0027s CEO.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Taryn was holding her brow. She was happy for Roman but she felt positively dizzy at the news. \"I can\u0027t believe that you\u0027re...that you\u0027ll - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave on a long overdue vacation.\" Looking so tall and commanding, he cocked his head toward the berths. \"Come and take a look at my baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Taryn felt lost for words. Someone was playing a joke. \"You\u0027ve been brainwashed. Or you fell and hit your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t thought this clearly in years. Come have a look. You don\u0027t have to go inside. Just admire her from the jetty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze dropping to that flower, Taryn felt her thoughts begin to spin. Cole seemed like a different person. But that wasn\u0027t quite right. The man who was smiling and looking so laid-back before her now was the same man she\u0027d fallen for on that island. The person she\u0027d been so drawn to. Was drawn to still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe schooled her face and her feelings. \"Thanks for the invitation, but I\u0027ll stay where I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere it\u0027s safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe collected her spoon and tasted her berries, but Cole didn\u0027t take the hint. He didn\u0027t leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn her second mouthful, he said, \"Taryn, I won\u0027t blame you if you don\u0027t come, but I\u0027m asking you...please. Two minutes, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn set down her spoon. She knew she ought to stick with no. He couldn\u0027t make her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, what harm could come from taking a quick look?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides she was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when he offered his hand as she moved to stand, she merely got to her feet and walked with him down a pier until they reached a berth that housed an impressive powered catamaran. Her lines were all glossy white, the trimmings gleaming chrome. She was long and the towered flybridge seemed to touch the clouds. Taryn could imagine Cole standing up there, facing the wind and the sea, enjoying the sunshine and battling ocean storms. The name on the boat\u0027s side was written in bold blue letters - BREAK OUT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was appropriate,\" he said. Setting his fists low on his hips, he studied his boat from bow to stern. \"So, what do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn met his gaze. He was smiling softly, seductively, with that I\u0027m-going-to-kiss-you-soon look sparkling in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo not happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enjoy many pleasant voyages together,\" she said, edging away, feeling a smoldering quiver build in her stomach. \"I really should get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to come along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth dropped open. Cole meant on his trip? He had gone mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she told him. \"I do not want to come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had the carpenters build a mini quarters for the cats inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked several times, let out a short sharp laugh. \"Cole, firstly I don\u0027t think you could take cats on a boat. They\u0027d jump off and drown.\" Surely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll take them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of that third voice, Taryn pivoted around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVi stood close enough to have heard the conversation. Her aunt shrugged. \"You know how I love cats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn could only stare. Was this some kind of conspiracy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got her breath back, Taryn asked her aunt, \"You knew about this, didn\u0027t you? You purposely led me down here so that Cole could run into me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole intervened. \"I contacted Vi and asked for her help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn couldn\u0027t remember an occasion when Vi had lied to her before. Honesty had always been the best policy in their house. But on a deeper level, looking into Vi\u0027s apologetic yet hopeful face now, she believed her aunt was sincerely doing what she thought was best. She didn\u0027t want her niece to throw away what might prove to be her only chance of real happiness. But Taryn had already made up her own mind about that, and she intended to stick with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe headed off. \"I\u0027m done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before she reached Vi, she ran into a man - a delivery guy by his uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man asked, \"Are you Taryn Quinn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned then nodded. \"Who wants to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply handed over his delivery - an enormous, fragrant bouquet. And not just any bunch of flowers. They were big bright scarlet blooms, like the one that boy had given her on the island, like the one she\u0027d found under that cafe table moments ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA jet of emotion filled her chest, her throat. Then her eyes were stinging with the threat of real tears. This was not fair. Was Cole this desperate to get her back into his bed? To snag a sleeping buddy on his Pacific voyage? She wasn\u0027t that easily bought, no matter what he might think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was ready to swing around and hand these flowers back to the person who had obviously arranged for them to arrive, when another deliveryman strode up, and another. Both were holding similar bouquets. And the men and flowers kept coming. When she couldn\u0027t possibly hold any more, Cole directed the men to arrange them on the deck of his boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGobsmacked, Taryn inspected the end of the pier. There must have been ten florist vans lined up. Deliverymen were still traveling down the pier, conveying her very own private world full of petals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she choked back emotion, Cole took the bouquets from her arms and handed them over to be laid out with the rest. Then he found her hands and, lifting one at a time, tenderly kissed the back of each wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than my mother, I\u0027ve never so much as given a daisy to a woman before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot tear slipped from the corner of her eye. She remembered. \"You give jewelry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to give you a piece now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back. \"But I don\u0027t want anything from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the space separating them. \"This isn\u0027t a trick, Taryn. There\u0027s no need to be afraid.\" He smiled. \"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a back trouser pocket, he withdrew a small velvet-covered box. He opened the lid then angled the box around for her to see what lay inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large diamond sat at the heart of the ring\u0027s setting. Two Ceylon sapphires, the color of their island\u0027s bay, hugged the main stone on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re that one special person I\u0027ve been waiting for,\" Cole told her. \"The woman I want to have as my wife. To bear my children.\" He grinned. \"When we\u0027re not sailing the high seas, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-but your work,\" she stammered. \"Your family commitments.\" She knew what he\u0027d told her, but she couldn\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From this day forward, I intend to take on board and cherish life\u0027s biggest responsibility. To love and care for the woman I adore.\" One hand took hers. \"Taryn, I can\u0027t sleep, can\u0027t eat, can barely think when you\u0027re not around. I need you in my life. As my partner. As my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped the ring on her finger then set that palm against the sandpaper rough of his jaw as his eyes searched hers and he waited for her response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn was drawn by the steam of his body, the determination of his will. Then she glanced back. Vi\u0027s gaze was upon her, her hands and bag clasped at her breasts while she obviously wished only the best for the grown woman who would always be her child. Behind her aunt, all those deliverymen were waiting, leaning on rails or against their vans. And a curious crowd had gathered, too, shoppers she\u0027d watched pass by, the waitress who had taken her order. All were hanging out for her reply. Yes. Or no. Taryn swallowed deeply then slowly turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of her torment these past days then she thought of how bright and clear the future suddenly looked. As Cole\u0027s brow pinched a little and more of his heart shone in his eyes, she took a breath and confessed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in love with you.\" Her sigh came out half sob, half laugh of sheer joy. \"I can\u0027t believe this is happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t waste a second. In a heartbeat, she was wrapped up in his arms and he was telling her, \"This is only the start. Our beginning.\" He pulled away enough to see her face, the tears of joy running down her cheeks. \"I was thinking maybe a ceremony at sea. But it\u0027s your call.\" He grinned. \"You\u0027re in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a honeymoon on Break Out?\" Salty trails curled under her chin. Given all those flowers, she warned him, \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any room on that boat left for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave the florist explicit instructions to leave the bunk free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where we sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth brushed and tickled her ear. \"Besides other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole swept her up into his arms. With the marina filled with vocal cheering well-wishers, he carried her aboard.
