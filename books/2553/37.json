The address was in the fabled borough of the Bronx. Not the nice Botanical Gardens Bronx, but the bad Bronx, theBonfire of the Vanities /\"Fort Apache\" Bronx. This particular section embodied most people\u0027s worst expectations: a wasteland of scattered buildings, some occupied, some abandoned, all battered, interspersed with vacant, garbage- strewn lots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, what happened here?\" Patrick muttered as he stepped out of the cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he closed the door behind him, his taxi chirped its tires and zoomed away. Patrick couldn\u0027t blame him. At least there were lots of cops around. No need to ask why they were here: The charred, smoking ruin of what must have been a cousin to the neighboring derelict buildings was the obvious center of attention. No fire trucks in sight now, but a couple of red SUVs bearing fire department logos stood out among the cluster of blue-and-white units blocking the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around and spotted Romy\u0027s long black cleathre coat among the gaggle of onlookers standing outside the yellow police tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly my idea of a fun place to spend a Saturday morning,\" he said as he reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re here,\" she said, but no smile lit her grim expression. \"Good. We can get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027How are you, Patrick?\u0027\" he said. \"\u0027Did you sleep well?\u0027 Why, yes, Romy. Thank you for asking. And how was your night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save it,\" she said, lifting the tape and ducking under. \"Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick complied as she approached a burly, clipboard-wielding sergeant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Sergeant,\" she said, holding up a leather ID folder. \"Romy Cadman, OPRR. Please fill me in on what you\u0027ve found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant swiveled his head and gave her a quick up and down with his pale blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O-P-what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Office for the Protection of Research Risks. We\u0027re federal. We monitor labs and test subjects, animal and human. Lieutenant Milancewich at Manhattan South notified me that this building might have housed an unlicensed lab and that sims could have been involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick knew Romy had no authority to be here, but said nothing, just stood by and admired her moxie as she weathered the sergeant\u0027s hostile stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did, did he? Well, I ain\u0027t heard of no OPRR and no Lieutenant Milancewich, and you\u0027re one hell of a long way from Manhattan South. We can handle this just fine without no feds nosing into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can,\" Romy said. \"OPRR has no investigative authority. We\u0027re only offering help. We know labs. We can trace diagnostic equipment better and faster than anyone. We know lab animals. If sims were used as test subjects here, we can help you track them. Our interest is purely statistical: We\u0027re keeping tally of illegal labs and what biologicals they produce.\" She opened her cleathre coat to return her ID folder to an inner pocket, revealing in the process a tight, black, ribbed knit sweater and long legs slinking from a short black skirt. \"We\u0027re a resource, sergeant. Use us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant\u0027s eyes lingered on her coat as she tied it closed, then he stuck out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy Yarger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy smiled and shook his hand. \"Call me Romy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick resisted an impulse to close his eyes and shake his head. If that had been him popping up in front of Sergeant Yarger with an OPRR ID, he\u0027d have been kicked back on the far side of the yellow tape before he\u0027d spoken word one. But Romy had just reduced this Bronx-hardened cop to a lap dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weaker sex? Yeah, tell me about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who\u0027s this?\" Yarger said, jutting his chin Patrick\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my assistant, Patrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick smiled and nodded at the sergeant, thinking, That\u0027s me, all right: faithful sidekick and gofer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYarger narrowed his eyes. \"Ain\u0027t I seen you before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the lab equipment?\" Romy prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your lieutenant friend was right. We found bits and pieces of all sorts of lab equipment in the wreckage. Some of it\u0027s been identified as - lemme see.\" He consulted his clipboard. \"Here we go: hematology machines, blood chemistry analyzers, immu...immuno...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy was nodding. \"I get the picture. Who identified the equipment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couple of M-E\u0027s boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M-E?\" Patrick said when he saw Romy\u0027s stricken look. \"Sims were killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should be so lucky. Nah. Just one very dead, very crisp human corpse. Male, age unknown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick stared at the burned-out ruins and couldn\u0027t help grimacing. They reminded him of what remained of his house, and how \"crisp\" he could have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a way to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t the fire that got him. A bullet saved him from that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Patrick said. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYarger gave him a steely look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What he means,\" Romy added quickly, \"is how can you tell if he was, as you say, \u0027very crisp\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant poked an index finger against the center of his forehead. \"Ain\u0027t never seen no fire burn a little hole here and blow off the back of a skull, know what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you,\" Romy said. \"But no, er, \u0027crisp\u0027 sims?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet anyways. Don\u0027t expect to find none either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Lieutenant Milancewich mentioned sims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. We have a witness who saw armed men herding a bunch of sims and some humans into a couple of vans just before the place lit up.\" He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know what sort of incendiary devices they used, but they musta been beauts. Place went up like it was made of paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But therecould be dead sims in there,\" Romy persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYarger crooked a finger and started moving away. \"C\u0027mere. I\u0027ll show you why there won\u0027t be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick and Romy followed him to a taped-off area near the corner. Yarger stopped and pointed to the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed spray-painted letters spread across the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFREE THE SIMS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDEATH TO SIM OPPRESSORS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSLA \"SLA?\" Patrick said with a glance at Romy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was troubled when she met his eyes. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" she whispered. \"But no. Impossible. He\u0027d never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Symbionese Liberation Army?\" Patrick raised his voice to cover hers. \"Didn\u0027t they kidnap Patty Hearst?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different group,\" Yarger said. \"These assholes are the \u0027SimLiberation Army.\u0027 Don\u0027t that beat all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they called themselves in the note they left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did it say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buncha sim-hugger garbage. The usual stuff. You know the rap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYarger gave Romy a you-gotta-be-kidding look. \"Forensics got it.\" He turned as someone called his name. \"Yeah. Be right there.\" Then back to Romy. \"Look, you wanna leave me your card, we\u0027ll call you if we think we need help. But don\u0027t wait up for it. And for the time being, stay on the other side of the tape, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick expected Romy to press him further, but she simply nodded. Patrick lifted the tape for her and she ducked under. She pulled out a compact camera and began snapping pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your scrapbook?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Zero. He\u0027ll want to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of Zero,\" he said, leaning close and whispering. \"Did you call him about this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t call Zero. You leave a message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could he be behind this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her camera. Her look was fierce. \"I told you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he consult you on everything he does? Of course not. So how do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started snapping pictures again. \"I just do. He lets me take care of the brothels and places like this. That\u0027smy job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well just what sort of place is it - or I guess I should say,was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A globulin farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I explained that when - wait. Did you see that Asian man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in that knot of people over there. I just pointed the camera in his direction and he ducked away. Where did he go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose on tiptoe to scan the area, then quickly ducked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell!\" She spun, turning her back to Patrick as she started moving toward the corner. \"Don\u0027t look around, just follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do it. I don\u0027t want to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, well!\" said a man\u0027s voice behind him. \"If it isn\u0027t Ms. Romy Cadman of OPRR. Fancy meeting you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Romy hissed; it sounded more like escaping steam than a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she turned, so did Patrick. He saw a swarthy, broad-shouldered man in a gray overcoat swaggering toward them. Patrick took an instant dislike to his smug expression. But his cold, dark eyes were his most arresting feature. Patrick felt like a mouse being scrutinized by a rattlesnake. But then the man\u0027s gaze flicked away. Patrick had been demoted from lunch to background scenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Portero,\" Romy said in a deep-freeze voice. \"What a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see why it should be. Sims were reported on the scene, and SimGen has a vital interest in the welfare of all sims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it does,\" Romy said, drawing out the first word. \"But to send its chief of security?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Free the sims\u0027 is not a phrase SimGen takes lightly, especially when it involves murder. I decided to look into this myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should introduce yourself to that sergeant over there,\" Romy said. \"His name\u0027s Yarger and he\u0027s anxious for all the help he can get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he is.\" Portero jerked a thumb toward the smoking ruin. \"What do you think? Globulin farm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick remembered now. \"That\u0027s where they infect sims with viruses and such and then drain off and sell their immune globulins, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned his glittering stare on Patrick. \"And you are...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a friend,\" Romy said. \"Patrick Sullivan. Patrick, meet Mr. Portero, security chief at SimGen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Portero said. \"I believe I\u0027ve heard of you. Some sort of lawyer, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick noticed that Portero had clasped his hands behind his back as he spoke. A handshake seemed out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some sort, yes,\" Patrick said. \"But about this globulin farm...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A small operation from what I can gather,\" Portero said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick glanced at the blackened ruins. \"Not any kind of operation now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks to this so-called SLA,\" Portero said. He stared at Romy. \"Ever hear of them, Romy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick felt his insides clench at the sound of her first name on Portero\u0027s lizard lips, but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy regarded him coolly. \"Not till this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand their methods,\" Portero said, rubbing his jaw as he looked around. \"I can see them making off with the sims, to free them later. But why fire the building? What if they\u0027d missed a few sims in their raid? They\u0027d have been cooked just like that corpse.\" He turned to Romy. \"Did your sergeant friend mention finding any sim bodies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...Thank God.\" Portero\u0027s eyes became distant; he seemed to recede for a moment, then gathered himself. \"But why did these terrorists make off with the humans as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero smiled as he shook his head. \"Oh, I doubt that, Romy. I doubt that very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he swaggered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something about this has got him worried,\" Romy said. \"He\u0027s putting on a good show, but something\u0027s bothering him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why he never blinks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t have to; he has nictitating membranes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That figures. And his tiny reptile heart is set on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy\u0027s lips twisted. \"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m taller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled for the first time since he\u0027d arrived. \"You know, sometimes I\u0027m glad you\u0027re around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only sometimes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hooked her arm through his and started walking. \"Let\u0027s go grab some breakfast and wait for Zero to get back to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent idea, but in a better neighborhood, if you please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they moved away he glanced back at Portero, intending to give him a look-what-I\u0027ve-got wink, but thought better of it when he saw the fierce look in those icy dark eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-37.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
