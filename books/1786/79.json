My lord, I would suggest that you dispense a footman and driver to Stony Cross Manor to collect Amelia at once. Mrs. Barnstable, send for the doctor. I\u0027ll bring Rohan here as soon as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" the housekeeper asked in bewilderment, \"are you referring to Dr. Harrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kev said instantly. All his instincts warned him to keep Harrow out of this. \"In fact, don\u0027t let him know what\u0027s going on. For the time being, keep this as quiet as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" Although the housekeeper didn\u0027t understand Kev\u0027s reasons, she was too well trained to question his authority. \"Mr. Rohan seemed perfecdy well earlier this morning,\" she said. \"What could have happened to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find out.\" Without waiting for further questions or reactions, Kev gripped the boy\u0027s shoulder and steered him toward the doorway. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vitsa appeared to be a small and prosperous family tribe. They had set up a well-organized camp, with two vardos and some healthy-looking horses and donkeys. The leader of the tribe, whom the boy identified as the rom phuro, was an attractive man with long black hair and warm, dark eyes. Although he was not tall, he was fit and lean, with an air of steady authority. Kev was surprised by the leader\u0027s relative youth. The word phuro usually referred to a man of advanced age and wisdom. For a man who appeared to be in his late thirties, it signified that he was an unusually respected leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey exchanged cursory greetings, and the rom phuro led Kev to his own vardo. \"Is he your friend?\" the leader asked with obvious concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother.\" For some reason Kev\u0027s comment earned an arrested glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is good that you\u0027re here. It may be your last chance to see him this side of the veil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev was astonished by his own visceral reaction to the comment, the rush of outrage and grief. \"He\u0027s not going to die,\" Kev said harshly, quickening his stride and fairly leaping into the vardo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of the Gypsy caravan was approximately twelve feet long and six feet broad, with the typical stove and metal chimney pipe located to the side of the door. A pair of transverse berths was located at the other end of the vardo, one upper and one lower. Cam Rohan\u0027s long body was stretched out on the lower berth, his booted feet dangling over the end. He was twitching and juddering, his head rolling ceaselessly on the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy hell,\" Kev said thickly, unable to believe such a change had been wrought in the man in such a short amount of time. The healthy color had been leeched out of Rohan\u0027s face until it was as white as paper, and his lips were cracked and gray. He moaned in pain, panting like a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev sat on the edge of the berth and put his hand on Rohan\u0027s icy forehead. \" Cam,\" he said urgently. \" Cam, it\u0027s Merripen. Open your eyes. Tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan struggled to control the tremors, to focus his gaze, but it was clearly impossible. He tried to form a word, but all he could produce was an incoherent sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattening a hand on Rohan\u0027s chest, Kev felt a ferocious and irregular heartbeat. He swore, recognizing that no man\u0027s heart, no matter how strong, could go on at that manic pace for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have eaten some herb without knowing it was harmful,\" the rom phuro commented, looking troubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev shook his head. \"My brother is very familiar with medicinal plants. He would never make that kind of mistake.\" Staring down at Rohan\u0027s drawn face, Kev felt a mixture of fury and compassion. He wished his own heart could take over the work for his brother\u0027s. \"Someone poisoned him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what I can do,\" the tribe leader said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, we need to get rid of as much of the poison as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His stomach emptied before we brought him into the vardo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was good. But for the reaction to be this bad, even after expelling the poison, meant it was a highly toxic substance. The heart beneath Kev\u0027s hand seemed ready to burst from Rohan\u0027s chest. He would go into convulsions soon. \"Something must be done to slow his pulse and ease the tremors,\" Kev said curtly. \"Do you have laudanum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but we have raw opium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even better. Bring it quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rom phuro gave orders to a pair of women who had come to the entrance of the vardo. In less than a minute, they had produced a tiny jar of thick brown paste. It was the dried fluid of the unripened poppy pod. Scraping up some of the paste with the tip of a spoon, Kev tried to feed it to Rohan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan\u0027s teeth clattered violently against the metal, his head jerking until the spoon was dislodged. Doggedly Kev slid his arm beneath Rohan\u0027s neck and lifted him upward. \" Cam. It\u0027s me. I\u0027ve come to help you. Take this for me. Take it now.\" He shoved the spoon back into Rohan\u0027s mouth and held it there while he choked and shook in Kev\u0027s grip. \"That\u0027s it,\" Kev murmured, withdrawing the spoon after a moment. He laid a warm hand on his brother\u0027s throat, rubbing gently. \"Swallow. Yes, phral, that\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opium worked with miraculous speed. Soon the tremors began to subside, and the frantic gasping eased. Kev wasn\u0027t aware of holding his breath until he let it out in a relieved sigh. He put his palm over Rohan\u0027s heart, feeling the jerking rhythm slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try giving him some water,\" the tribe leader suggested, handing a carved wooden cup to Kev. He pressed the edge of the cup against Rohan\u0027s lips, and coaxed him to take a sip. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-79.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM"}
