After Lin Ming entered, he felt as if he had jumped into a stove and all of his skin was being roasted. However, because he had refined flames within his body for a long time, and also because of his previous experiences with searing flames, such an experience was nothing at all to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe fragrance of the golden liquid flooded his senses like a finely aged wine. The liquid was exquisitely sweet; a single gulp was like a stream of heat that flowed down his mouth and throat, warming his stomach, spreading to his limbs and filling him with a brilliantly radiant energy. All of the muscles of his body stretched out and he emitted loud popping sounds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of Lin Ming’s pores dilated, and pure energy flooded through them. As the heat flowed in, he felt a pin-like pain through his pores. However, this aching pain through his body actually made Lin Ming excited instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis medicinal juice brewed with a Nirvana Dragon Root that was tens of thousands of years old held an incomparably pure energy. The energy filtered through Lin Ming’s bones, entering into his marrow where it constantly accumulated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi chi chi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the pure energy entered his marrow, it was a painful experience. But at this time, Lin Ming only felt comfortable all over, and his mind was in a bright and clear state. There wasn’t even a hint of the pain that he had experienced when he used the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal for Tempering Marrow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithin the golden juice, Lin Ming stretched out, relaxing all his limbs. He took great gulps of the golden fluid, swallowing as much as he could.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter this golden fluid had filled all of Lin Ming’s meridians, it began to discharge from his pores. The energy continued to accumulate. Although there was a dull ache, it was extremely wonderful, as if he were flying to the heavens and becoming an immortal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, this peaceful feeling didn’t last too long. As Lin Ming used the law formula of the ‘Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians’ to control the energy for tempering, he felt the aching pain grow increasingly strong and vibrant. Lin Ming felt like his body was becoming a balloon that was filled to the brim with energy, about to pop open at any moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe raging energy crashed through his meridians. Even though Lin Ming’s body had been toughened already by Tempering Marrow, he still almost couldn’t withstand it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Boy, hurry up and seal your pores.

The Purple Comet Spear appeared and he displayed the moves of the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’. As the Purple Comet Spear thrust through the golden juice, every swing was met with great resistance. With every spear move, Lin Ming’s bones issues out sounds like crackling thunder. Strips of his yellow bone marrow became bright red, and from that bright red they began to shift to a golden hue.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMore and more golden strips appeared, until all of his marrow became a deep shining gold.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs every spear move struck out, the rich golden juice was cut apart by the Purple Comet Spear. His true essence shot out like a sharpened blade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t know how many spear moves he had made, or how many hours he had done so. He only felt his blood boiling and his true essence endlessly growing. Even with all this effort, he didn’t feel a bit tired.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe energy that filled his body was contained within by his sealed pores. As his spear moves used up the excess energy and he absorbed the rest, his pores opened once again, wantonly absorbing energy from the golden juice. As time passed, the golden juice became increasingly pale, and over half of it had already disappeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, Lin Ming felt a sharp pain his back, as if someone were taking a fiery needle and piercing his spine!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, the pain was enough to cause Lin Ming to break into a cold sweat. But he wasn’t surprised. Pain in his spine meant one thing – that energy had entered into his spinal cord!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe spinal cord and bone marrow were different. The spinal cord was a center of nerves. It was extremely fragile and fragmented. If the spinal cord could not be tempered, then the spine would become the weakness of the body, simply unable to bear the immense pressure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTempering the spine was the final step of Tempering Marrow. And, it was also the most difficult. There were even some disciples of the Realm of the Gods that could not afford the precious and rare raw materials and medicine required, and became unable to completely and thoroughly temper their spine. This caused their foundation to be shaky, and this weakness of their body carried through.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the material that Lin Ming had used to make the medicine was a Nirvana Dragon Root that had lived for tens of thousands of years. Naturally, he wouldn’t have this problem.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t know how many times he had displayed the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’. He continued until the sphere of liquid became completely clear, and all of the golden juice had been absorbed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, at the moment that the golden juice was completely absorbed, the scattered true essence in Lin Ming’s dantian began to spontaneously condense into a twisting vortex, slowly spinning around.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe originally chaotic state suddenly became organized.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiantian realm!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sign of the Pulse Condensation was true essence meridian penetration, the sign of the Houtian realm was true essence accumulating in the dantian, and the sign for the Xiantian realm was true essence forming an organized system within the dantian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s true essence system was… a vortex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s eyes flashed open, his eyes twinkling with arcs of thunder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ball of water that had been bound together by true essence completely collapsed on itself. A massive amount of water splashed onto the ground, and Lin Ming fell stark naked onto the floor. At this moment, he was in extremely high spirits.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a single leap, his cultivation had broken through to the Xiantian realm, and he had also completed 100% of Tempering Marrow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Tempering Marrow reached 100%, it could be said that Lin Ming had been reborn. His skin was more delicate, and his fine muscles were toned and symmetrical. Lin Ming was now an absurdly handsome young man, his body containing both auras of strength and a soft beauty. It was as if he were an exquisite masterpiece that had been sculpted by hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s appearance also became more mature. His original sharp aura converged together.

You stepped into the Xiantian realm and you probably aren’t even 18 years old yet.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘Lucky bastard that stepped into dog shit with heaven defying luck?’ As Lin Ming heard the pug speak, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

The only way to do so was to conceal his identity, and live in seclusion in far off mountains while remaining completely anonymous. Since he didn’t have the strength to resist a third stage Life Destruction martial artist, he would never be able to go out, otherwise he would draw a calamity unto himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd, it wouldn’t be just him, but Divine Phoenix Island would also be caught up in his troubles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, if he stayed in seclusion to cultivate and didn’t go out to journey and adventure, the chances of him breaking through to the next stage were simply too low.
