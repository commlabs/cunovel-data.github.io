A deathly stillness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue fear is not being without light or sound. True fear is being without hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were drinking milk. Only the sound of their suckling gave testament to the fact that life still existed here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how long could their lives be preserved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was once more tightly gripping his sabre, but caught in this deadly trap, even his sabre was useless to break them out of here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have gone and comforted Zhuo Yuzhen, but he didn’t know what he should say. His mind was in turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had always viewed life and death very lightly. But he couldn’t do so for the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he wasn’t their true father, they now had a miraculous connection to each other, a connection which was even more intimate than between children and their real fathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he had personally delivered these children with his own two hands, it was almost as though they were a continuation of his own life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sort of emotion was both complicated and subtle. The only reason why the world can continue to exist is because humanity is capable of this sort of emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen suddenly said, “I heard Mingyue Xin say that you all were once trapped in here before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue grunted in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Since you were able to think of a way out in the past, you’ll definitely be able to think of another way this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were shining with light, filled with hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue truly could not bear to extinguish that hope. But he also couldn’t hide the truth from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The reason we were able to escape last time was because there was a perfect weapon for smashing walls here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, this place was empty. Aside from the four of them, there was only a corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpse had already become cold and stiff. Sooner or later, they would be as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a gleam of hope remained in Zhuo Yuzhen’s eyes. “I often hear people say that your sabre is an unparalleled weapon!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue looked at the sabre in his hand. His eyes were filled with bitter hatred. “This is a tool for killing people, not saving people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bitter hatred wasn’t directed towards others. It was directed towards himself. So long as he could save the children, he would be willing to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was nothing he could do at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen’s hope finally died away. With an effort, she actually forced a smile to her face. “At least we still have one hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe consoled Fu Hongxue, “Yan Nanfei wanted you to wait here. He will definitely return.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “If he was going to return, he would have done so by now. Now, even if he returned, he would definitely assume that we weren’t inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen shut her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she knew that Fu Hongxue’s words were true. Yan Nanfei definitely wouldn’t think of the possibility that they would have stayed here for so long. Even less would he think of Fu Hongxue being buried alive here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on Fu Hongxue’s senses and reaction time, if anybody above them made the slightest movement, they should not have been able to hide it from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who could have imagined that right at that moment, he was busy delivering those children? Who would have imagined that there would be the sound of infants crying here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many things in the world which no one can predict at all. True events are sometimes more bizarre and fantastical than the events in legends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children started to cry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat dripped down from the palm of Fu Hongxue’s hand. He suddenly thought of something he could do for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething which he originally would rather die than do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, he definitely would have to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping was also a well-travelled, world-wise person. Such a person would definitely carry certain emergency tools on his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRifling through a dead man’s possessions was something which made him nauseous just thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, he was already doing just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found a matchbook, a long roll of rope, a realgar gem designed to repel snakes and drive out disease, a bottle of medicine for cuts, a half-eaten piece of ginseng, a keychain, a pearl flower, a few ingots of gold, several banknotes for silver, and a letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePearls and yellow gold were things which people originally would do anything to get their hands on, to the point where they would even exchange their dignity for them. But right now, they had become worthless instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that this was a form of satire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter giving birth, a person would be weak. The children were drinking milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone would know that right now, that which Zhuo Yuzhen needed the most was ginseng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue quietly pulled out his sabre, slicing away the parts which had been gnawed on. This was the first time he had pulled out his sabre for something which was not alive, and the second time Zhuo Yuzhen saw the sabre. He did not care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barriers which existed between him and her had been shattered during the childbirth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA miraculous relationship existed between the two of them as well, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen didn’t bring this up. She quietly accepted the ginseng, but her eyes were focused on that pearl flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a peony flower. Every single pearl on it was perfectly formed and without flaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft, sleek sheen. Ingenious workmanship. In the middle of the darkness, it appeared all the more beautiful and extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight appeared in her eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a girl after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glamour cast by jewels and pearls is something which no girl can resist against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue hesitated for a while. Finally, he gave it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he shouldn’t have done this. But at this moment in time, why bother preventing her from enjoying this last bit of pleasure, this last bit of joy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen laughed. Her laughter was like that of a child’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children who were crying fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You should sleep as well!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “I can’t fall asleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “As long as you close your eyes, you will be able to fall asleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could tell that she was already very tired. She had lost too much blood, and had undergone too much suffering and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes finally closed. She immediately sunk deeper into the sweet, peaceful darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue silently watched her. A mother sleeping with her infants should be something of great joy and beauty. But now…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gritted his teeth and made up his mind to not allow himself to shed tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, he definitely would seek out every single thing which might help them escape. But although he had a pair of eyes that could see in the dark, he too was very tired right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lit the match. The first thing he saw was eight characters on the seal of the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To Yan Nanfei, my little brother. Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan it be that this letter was given by Gongzi Yu, for Zhao Ping to deliver to Yan Nanfei?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy little brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat relationship, exactly, did they once have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue mastered his curiosity. He folded the letter, then stored it in his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping hadn’t had the chance to deliver this letter. He hoped to still have a chance to see Yan Nanfei again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he himself knew that the chance of that was really very small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Fu Hongxue, aside from this letter and the ginseng, the things found on Zhao Ping’s body were totally worthless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he had neglected something. There should not have been a pearl flower on the body of a man like Zhao Ping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when he thought of this, it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mother and her children were still sleeping. A strange sound could suddenly be heard in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue once more lit the match. He saw a snake scurry out from a stone cupboard, scurrying towards the dim left corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn’t stand the smell of the realgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cellar had no ventilation. The air gradually grew stale. The smell of the realgar became especially powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue immediately discovered something terrifying. Perhaps they wouldn’t have to wait for hunger and thirst to kill them. They might suffocate to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children didn’t yet have the ability to adapt to the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, he discovered something else. Something which made him very happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several snakes wriggled into that dark corner, they disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be a way out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was a crack in that corner of the wall, was it recently created by his actions, or had it always been there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he wasn’t a snake, and didn’t know whether the outside of the wall was above ground or underground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as he had the opportunity, he definitely wouldn’t let it slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struck out with his sabre!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Zhuo Yuzhen awoke, Fu Hongxue had been chopping at the stone wall for a long time. The cracks in the wall had gradually grown bigger, to the point where even the fattest of mice could get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, they weren’t mice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the children woke up, they cried again. After they cried, they fell asleep once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen took off her outer clothes, laying it on the floor. She gently laid down the sleeping infants, then forced herself to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was gasping. His clothes were sopping wet. A sleeping person might not notice, but he had expended too much energy. The thinning air seemed to have become intolerable to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to escape immediately. He used even more energy. Suddenly, with a cracking sound, a notch appeared on the blade of his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sabre had become part of his body, even a part of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen bit off a piece of ginseng. She silently handed it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shook his head. “The children need milk. You need it more than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen mournfully said, “But if you collapse, who can live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue gritted his teeth. Another notch appeared on his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen’s tears began to flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was originally a matchless, incomparable sabre, even to overawe even the wind and the clouds and fill heroes with terror. But right now, it wasn’t even as useful as a metal spade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a cruel, sorrowful thing this was!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, Fu Hongxue himself could understand this sentiment. He almost was really about to collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen’s hands suddenly silently moved towards him, filled with a sweet fluid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Fu Hongxue opened his mouth, the fluid flowed past his lips. An indescribably sweet and refreshing feeling filled his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her breast milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had sworn an oath to never again shed tears. But at this moment, he couldn’t prevent the hot tears from forcing their way out from his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just at this moment, something suddenly appeared in the middle of the crack on the stone wall. It was a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scarlet red sword!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a cloth wrapped around the sword, upon which was written ten words. These words were written with blood. “I have not died yet. You cannot die yet either!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children began to cry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud, sonorous boom stirred life awake!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight filled the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children finally saw the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue only hoped that all the children of the world who were born into darkness would be able to live under the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I actually already left. I left three times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you came back three times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why I came back either. At first, I thought that you definitely wouldn’t be inside here.” Yan Nanfei was laughing. “Because even in my dreams, I never could have imagined that a day would come when Fu Hongxue would be buried alive by someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t the slightest hint of ill-will in his laughter. His heart was truly filled with joy. “The last time I came, I was planning to leave as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I suddenly heard a very strange sound. It sounded like someone eating fava beans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was the sound of a sabre starting to chip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whose sabre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei’s eyebrows rose and his mouth hung open. Shocked, he stared at Fu Hongxue, appearing as though he were even more shocked than he would be upon hearing that the world itself had chipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fu Hongxue only laughed. “My sabre is only a very ordinary sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Your hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I still have my hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “So long as you still have your hand, even a chipped sabre can kill people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s laughter suddenly disappeared. “Where are they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei sighed. With a bitter smile, he said, “They aren’t here. I’m afraid I don’t know where they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar away, a carriage could be seen, but no one was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue asked, “You rode a carriage here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei chuckled. “I rode a carriage here all three times. I hate walking. If I have a chance to ride, I definitely won’t walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue looked at him. “Only because you hate walking? Not because of your leg?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei looked at him as well. He suddenly sighed. “Why is it that I cannot hide anything from you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infants were wrapped in Fu Hongxue’s outer garments. Yan Nanfei was suppressing his amazement the entire time. He didn’t ask about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Fu Hongxue didn’t bring it up at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that if Fu Hongxue didn’t want to bring up something, you had best pretend you don’t know about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zhuo Yuzhen, smiling, was already calling out to him. “Uncle Yan, why don’t you come see our children?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei finally could no longer contain himself. He couldn’t help but ask, “Your children?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen glanced at Fu Hongxue out of the corner of her eyes. “Can it be that he did not tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Tell me what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen smiled beautifully. “One of these two children is surnamed Qiu, the other is surnamed Fu. The boy is the heir to the bloodline of the Qiu family. His name is Qiu Xiaoqing. The girl was born first. Her name is Fu Xiaohong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were filled with pride and satisfaction. “We already agreed to this. We have already…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face blushed, and she lowered her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei looked at her, then looked at Fu Hongxue. He looked even more shocked than earlier, when he heard that the sabre had chipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had turned around. He pulled the clothes firmly around the children, then said, “Why don’t you get on the carriage first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen already sat inside the carriage. Only then did Fu Hongxue and Yan Nanfei slowly walk over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire time, neither of them opened their mouths. After a long time, Fu Hongxue suddenly said, “You didn’t think it possible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei forced a laugh. “There are many things which are unthinkable in this world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You are opposed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “I know that you definitely had your own difficulties which are hard to discuss. Perhaps…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue interrupted his words. “If time could go back, I would still have made the same choice. The children cannot be without a father. Somebody must be their father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei’s smile became genuine and optimistic. “Aside from you, I really can’t think of anyone else who could be their father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked very slowly, and his posture seemed to have become similar to that of Fu Hongxue’s. He was coughing nonstop as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly came to a stop. Staring at him, he said, “How many wounds did you take?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Not many.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly reached out and pulled his clothes open. Across his firm and strong chest, there were two fingernail markings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurple fingernail scratches, appearing as though they had been dyed into his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s pupils immediately contracted. “This is the ‘Great Violet Palm of Decapitating Heaven and Shattering Earth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei grunted in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Were you struck on the leg by the ‘Bone Penetrating Nail’ or the ‘Soul Hunting Needle’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei smiled bitterly. “If it was the ‘Soul Hunting Needle’, would I still be standing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “People came from the Xingxiuhai plateau of the Western Regions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Just one person!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Was the person who came Duo Qingzi, or Wu Qingzi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei sighed. “Duo Qingzi is just as merciless when making his move.” [This is a pun; Duo Qingzi means ‘man of great tenderness and affection’, while Wu Qingzi means ‘man without mercy’.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Is the ‘Bone Penetrating Nail’ still in your leg?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “The only thing in my leg is a hole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretched out his hands, revealing a hidden projectile that sparkled in his palm with cold light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one were to choose the top ten most deadly hidden projectile weapons in the world, beyond a doubt the ‘Bone Penetrating Nail’ would be one of them. Yan Nanfei suddenly chuckled. “Fortunately, my luck isn’t half bad. He shot out thirteen ‘Bone Penetrating Nails’. I only got hit by one, and it didn’t hit a vital point. I was able to run a bit faster than they were. Otherwise, even if Duo Qingzi didn’t kill me, Yang Wuji would have taken my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter seemed very cheerful. “Let me tell you a little secret. Although my skill in killing isn’t as good as yours, my skill in running for my life is number one in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue reached into his clothes. Only after Yan Nanfei was finished speaking did he remove his hand, pulling the letter out with it. “Read it after you get in the carriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who will be driver?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei laughed. “I seem to remember that you didn’t know how to drive in the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Now I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “When did you learn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him. Suddenly, he said, “Did you always know how to run for your life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei thought a moment, then shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “When did you learn how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “When I reached the point where I had no other choice but to do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shut his mouth again. He believed that Yan Nanfei knew what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a man reached a point where he must do something, he would do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe letter was very long, stretching across three scrolls of paper. Even before they got on the carriage, Yan Nanfei began to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was always an impatient sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was very good at tamping down his curiosity. He didn’t ask what the letter contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvidently, it was a very amusing letter, as Yan Nanfei’s eyes were filled with a hint of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with a sort of cynical laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly said, “It seems Gongzi Yu really is a good person. He really cares very much about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei laughed. “He advises me to leave your company immediately, because you have become an almost pestilential creature. Anyone in your company will suffer misfortune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed loudly, then said, “He even wrote out a list for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “A list?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “The list includes the names of all the people who wants to kill us. The people who want to kill you numbers one more than the people who want to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly said, “One person isn’t very much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Sometimes it isn’t very much, sometimes it isn’t very little. It depends on who this person is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter was very unhappy. “Strictly speaking, the person who wants to kill you can’t even be considered a person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What is he, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “He should at least be counted as ten people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Is it Wu Qingzi, of the Xingxiuhai plateau?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Compared to this person, Wu Qingzi can at most be considered a kid who just learned how to kill people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Who is this person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei went into the carriage and closed the door, as though afraid that he himself might jump out. “It is a man who uses a sabre, a very special sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What sabre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei pulled the carriage door a little tighter shut. Only then did he say, one word at a time, “The ‘Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch’!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage was very spacious. Zhuo Yuzhen put the girl on her knee while holding the boy in her hands. Her eyes were focused on Yan Nanfei. Finally, she couldn’t help but ask, “What type of sabre is the ‘Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei forced out a laugh. “Strictly speaking, it cannot be considered a sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “It should be considered ten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei didn’t directly respond. Instead, he asked her, “Did you see Xiao Siwu’s dagger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen thought for a moment, then nodded. “I saw him before. He always uses a dagger to trim his nails.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “It would take at least five hundred daggers like that to forge a single ‘Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch’!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen sucked in a breath. “Five hundred daggers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei asked again, “Do you know how many people he’s killed with that sabre in a single blow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Two people? Three? Five?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei let out a sigh. “With one chop, he killed twenty seven people. Every single one of their heads was split in two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen’s countenance changed. She tightened her grip around the child in her bosom. Staring out the window, she forced a laugh. “Are you trying to scare me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei smiled bitterly. “If you see that sabre, you’ll know whether or not I’m trying to scare you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly shook his head. “But naturally, you won’t see it. Heaven, bless and protect us. Don’t let her see that sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen asked no more questions, because she saw something very strange. “Look, there’s a wheel there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t at all strange for a carriage to have a wheel, but why would a wheel be rolling down the road by itself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei couldn’t help but stick out his head to take a look. The expression on his face changed as well. “This wheel is from our carriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he finished speaking, the carriage began to tilt, slowly beginning to tilt towards one side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen cried out loud, “Look! Why is there half a horse there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a horse? How could there be such a thing as half a horse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was even more frightening was that this horse was still galloping forwards on two legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a storm of blood rain sprayed forth from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat half-horse ran for another seven or eight steps before falling down. Its liver, intestines, and internal organs fell onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei shouted loudly, “Careful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the sound of his voice dissipated, the carriage suddenly flipped around in mid-air, as though it had somersaulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei rushed over, gathered Zhuo Yuzhen and the children to himself, then kicked the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand stretched out from outside the door. Fu Hongxue’s voice could be heard. “Grab hold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir two hands joined. Fu Hongxue gripped Yan Nanfei’s hand, while Yan Nanfei held Zhuo Yuzhen and the children. With an exploding sound, both the adults and the children flew out from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, with a thundering sound, the carriage crashed into a large tree by the side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt disintegrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh noon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weather was sunny and cheerful. The sunlight was gorgeous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fresh sunlight was shining on the road. But suddenly, a dark cloud covered it, blocking off the sunrays. It was as though even the sun couldn’t bear to watch what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage had been shattered into many pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse pulling the carriage had been chopped in twain. The back half was still attached to the carriage. The front half lay fallen by the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened just then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen tightly held her children, not letting her children cry. Although she herself didn’t know what had just happened either, she was simply too frightened, so frightened that she forgot all of her pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she felt as though all the bones in her body had been ground to dust, fear had rendered her totally numb. And then, she couldn’t help but vomit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young woodcutter was standing by the side of the road. He couldn’t help but vomit as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was just about to go on this road earlier, but he took a step back, because he saw this carriage charging this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage-driver had a pallid face and appeared as though he wished he could make this carriage immediately travel eight hundred li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can it be that this person is rushing to a funeral?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young, vigorous woodcutter was just about to curse at him, but before he even started, he saw a gleam of sabre light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a matter of fact, he couldn’t tell if it was sabre light, or lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he saw was a gleam of light fly out from within the forest, and then…it suddenly split apart. The front half and the back half actually split apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front half of the horse was actually still running with its two front legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened afterwards, the woodcutter didn’t notice at all. He couldn’t believe this was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped this was a dream, nothing more than a bad dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was already vomiting.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-11\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-13\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-12","bookId":1505,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM"}
