{"id":89958,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t tell Nic. He didn\u0027t believe in magic. He\u0027d take me to the nearest hospital, lock me up and throw away the key. Then we\u0027d have real trouble, since my medication had blown up with the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe, locked inside, with the full moon less than a week away. Yeah, trouble. However, that was the least of my worries at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the shed; Nic inspected the place with typical FBI precision. No one was inside. No one had tampered with the ATV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive,\" 1 said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t get to think. I know where we\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could figure it out,\" he grumbled, but he climbed on behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell by the tenseness of Nic\u0027s thighs against mine, and the tiny starts he was unable to stop every time the ATV tipped a little too far to one side, that he wasn\u0027t used to riding them, and he didn\u0027t care for anyone else to be in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the highway, a loose terra for any paved road in the vicinity, and I took off at the fastest clip the ATV would allow - about thirty miles per hour. Driving at top speed without a helmet wasn\u0027t my idea of fun, even though I had nothing to fear from a head injury. Nic, however, did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to take us two hours or more to get to town,\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got a better idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis silence was answer enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe traveled at a pace slower than the average wolf, which could run forty miles per hour on a bad day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuper-wolves, in other words, lycanthropes, could top that speed with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I drove I considered the icon in my pocket. Was the totem a clue? A threat? An accident? I needed to show the talisman to Will Cadotte, our expert on Native American mysticism. Conveniently, he had gone to Wisconsin with Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the thing truly growled? I would have said no, except Nic had heard it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never observed any supernatural behavior from the black totem, but that didn\u0027t mean there hadn\u0027t been any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie McQuade, a J-S agent and former police officer, swore she\u0027d seen the totem move on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was I to say she was nuts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued in silence for close to an hour. Talking was pointless with the roar of the motor and the thunder of the wind. But I didn\u0027t need words to hear Nic loud and clear. The press of his thighs wasn\u0027t the only thing I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d missed me, in more ways than one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis palms rode my waist; his thumbs slid under my suit coat and toyed with the skin just above my panty hose. His breath teased the hair that had fallen loose from my customary French twist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to be honest with him. What had been between us once could never be again, despite the treacherous response of my body to his. I had too many secrets I couldn\u0027t share. Too much work that had to be done. Too many monsters that wanted me dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed, half-expecting him to cup my breasts, then latch his mouth onto my neck and suckle. Legs wide as I straddled the seat, the wind shot up my skirt, stirring me where I needed no help being stirred. His fingertips grazed the swell of my rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nic,\" I said. Protest, plea - I wasn\u0027t sure. Didn\u0027t matter. The wind flung the word into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow began to fall - thick, fluffy flakes that would soon obscure the road. I had to concentrate. We needed to reach a town before the storm hit, or worse. I was already half-frozen and I was certain Nic was, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was impossible to think as Nic\u0027s hand slid across my skin, palm warm, hard, flat against my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down. My skirt was hiked to my hips, and the sight of my stocking-clad legs, my white cotton briefs, his sun-browned hand and callused fingers, excited me so much that 1 did nothing when his middle finger slid lower and stroked me just once. Lucky no one was on the highway except us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr so I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my gaze, then swerved to avoid the huge black wolf in the middle of the road. The right wheel slipped off the pavement, and we were airborne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvidence was on our side, and we were thrown clear. Most ATV injuries are the result of the machine falling on top of the riders. As it was, I landed on my shoulder and something crunched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the pain, I scrambled to my feet, searching frantically for Nic. I found him at the edge of the tree line. He wasn\u0027t moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf swung his head toward me. Light gray, human eyes shone in a feral face. \"Billy,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have known he hadn\u0027t died. Guys like him never did. It would take something worse than a firebomb to put an end to Billy Bailey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where had he been? Had it taken him some time to heal his injuries, then dig his way out of the rubble?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the others? Had they survived, as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strained my ears but heard only the wind, sniffed the air and caught nothing but the scent of snow and crazy Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither the rest of my basement wolves had found freedom, then scattered, or they were ashes and Billy was a lot more powerful than I\u0027d thought. And wasn\u0027t that just special?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly\u0027s head cocked; his tongue lolled, almost as if he were laughing. Hell, he probably was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fingered the gun in my pocket. I could put every bullet into Billy, and it wouldn\u0027t slow him down. If I stayed in this form, he\u0027d kill me - if I was lucky - then move on to Nic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to have to shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, such things took time, and at mid-shift I\u0027d be defenseless. Billy had no scruples. He\u0027d wait until the worst possible moment, then attack. Nevertheless, I had to take the risk, hope my changing at all would confuse him long enough for me to assume another form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to kick off my shoes - I hated it when my paws burst through them - but I didn\u0027t have the chance to remove anything else. Not that I\u0027d strip in front of Billy even if I had a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I lifted my face, snowflakes brushed my cheeks, stuck to my eyelashes, prickled my nose. I pushed aside the sensory distractions and thought of the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it had been full I wouldn\u0027t have had to try. Without the round silver disc that pulled like the ebb and flow of the tide, the transformation was a bit harder, especially for those with stunted imaginations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bet Billy had had one helluva time getting furry tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe growled, low in his throat. I was up to something, but he didn\u0027t know what. Pretty soon he\u0027d get sick of wondering, come over here and kick my ass. With me still a woman, and him already a beast, he\u0027d have no trouble at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at the black velvet sky, I envisioned the cool metallic white of the moon spilling across my face. I smelled the wind, the trees, the earth. Night. The totem in my pocket shimmied, and my favorite suit split at the seams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shifting of bones, the curving of spine, usually produced agony. Going from bipedal to quadrapedal wasn\u0027t supposed to feel good. My skin would bum when the fur came. My fingers and toes always ached as they sprouted claws. My face hurt as my nose and my mouth melded into a snout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loathed getting furry - always had, maybe I always would if I never discovered a cure - but pain was the least of it. I hated being covered with hair, sprouting a tail. The drooling, the panting, the howling, and I never could get the dirt out from under my fingernails. Becoming a werewolf was hell on a manicure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut tonight, the transformation was painless. Tonight I thought about being a wolf, and suddenly I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly yelped. I was the fastest changer in the West. A damned werewolf savant. Something peculiar was going on, but I didn\u0027t have time to figure out what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerewolves not only have human eyes, they possess human intelligence. I knew what I had to do and why, so without giving Billy time to think, I charged. This wasn\u0027t fun and games but a fight to the death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly would come after me, and he\u0027d keep on coming until he had what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d rather be dead than Billy Bailey\u0027s sex slave. That knowledge gave me an edge. I hit him hard, and he tumbled onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither confusion had slowed his reactions, or I\u0027d suddenly become faster than the average werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe both. My teeth grazed Billy\u0027s throat before he sent me flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI landed on the same shoulder that had hit the ground when I\u0027d flown off the ATV, and I whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout human blood, I wouldn\u0027t heal completely tonight, though just becoming a wolf would improve any injury faster than it was possible to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly struck me broadside before I could roll onto all fours. I slammed into the dirt hard enough to make my ears ring. My head ached, and I had a difficult time focusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could have killed me then, if he hadn\u0027t been an insane sadomasochist. Instead of going for my jugular, he drew blood from my belly, and then licked it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgust flowed through me, followed closely by anger. Using my legs, my claws, I threw him free, then I did what he hadn\u0027t. Jumping on top, I latched onto Billy\u0027s throat and pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I tried to get out of the way, blood sprayed my face and chest. I scuttled backward, not even waiting to see Billy\u0027s human eyes go wolf as he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted into a woman more quickly than I ever had before. My clothes a torn tangle, I still managed to cover myself adequately. Scooping a handful of snow, I let it melt in my palm so I could scrub away some of the blood and the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering the slash to my stomach, I lifted my suit. Nothing. Frowning, I rolled my shoulder. Not a twinge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the talisman granted fast healing powers along with swift changing ability? Seemed so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could get used to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried to Nic, kneeling next to him as his eyes opened, crossed, then focused on my face. \"I saw a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I almost hit him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He reached up and tugged my hair, loose now and swirling around my shoulders. \"With fur like this and...\" He frowned. \"Your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my face neutral, even as my heart threatened to choke me. Nevertheless, when I spoke, my voice was as cool as the breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have bumped your head a lot harder than I thought.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-6.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
