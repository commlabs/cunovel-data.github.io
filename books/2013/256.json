The leader of the train walked wearily over to join the scout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is that not the Drene Factor’s seal on that carriage?’ he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scout nodded. ‘So it is.’ His gaze strayed past the rather unimpressive man standing opposite him. ‘You are not traders, I see. Yet, plenty of guards.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A wise investment, I should judge,’ the man replied, nodding. ‘The garrison fort gave proof enough of that. It stands abandoned still, half burnt down and strewn with the bones of slaughtered soldiers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scout shrugged. ‘The west side of the range is notorious for bandits. I heard they was hunted down and killed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is that so?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So I heard. And there’s a new detachment on its way, along with carpenters, tree-fellers and a blacksmith. The fort should be rebuilt before season’s end.’ He shrugged. ‘It’s the risk of the road.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenitt Sathad nodded again. ‘We passed no-one on the trail. Is the Factor coming to join you here, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is it not unusual, this journey? Drene, after all, is on the far side of the sea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Factor’s business is his own,’ the scout replied, a little tersely. ‘You never answered me, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did not? What was your question again?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I asked what you were carrying, that needs so few packs and so many guards.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am not at liberty to tell you, alas,’ Venitt Sathad said, as he began scanning the camp. ‘You had more soldiers here, not long ago.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Went down the valley yesterday.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To meet the Factor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just so. And I’ve had a thought-if they come up this night, the campsite here won’t be big enough. Not for them and your group.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I expect you are correct.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps it’d be best, then, if you moved on. There’s another site two thousand paces down the valley. You’ve enough light, I should think.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenitt Sathad smiled. ‘We shall do as you have asked, then. Mayhap we will meet your Factor on the way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mayhap you will, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the man’s eyes, Venitt Sathad saw the lie. Still smiling, he walked back to his horse. ‘Mount up,’ he told his guards. ‘We ride on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA most displeasing command, but Venitt Sathad had chosen his escort well. Within a very short time, the troop was once more on its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea why the man he was sent to meet was on this trail, so far from Drene. Nor did Venitt know where Anict had gone, since on all sides but ahead there was naught but rugged, wild mountains populated by little more than rock-climbing horned sheep and a few cliff-nesting condors. Perhaps he would find out eventually. As it was, sooner or later Letur Anict would return to Drene, and he, Venitt Sathad, agent of Rautos Hivanar and the Letheras Liberty Consign, would be waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some questions from his master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd some answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shriek echoed in the distance, then faded. Closer to hand, amidst flickering lantern-light and wavering shadows, the last cries of the slaughtered had long since fallen away, as soldiers of Orbyn’s guard walked among the piled bodies-mostly the young, women and the aged in this chamber-ensuring that none still breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone did. Orbyn Truthfinder had made certain of that himself. In a distracted way, torn as he was by distaste and the necessity that no carelessness be permitted. They had been four bells in this subterranean maze, at the most, to mark the first breach of wards at the entranceway in the crevasse and all that followed, from room to room, corridor to corridor, the assault of light and refulgent sorcery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever elaborate organization of power had held fast in this buried demesne had been obliterated with scarce the loss of a single Letherii life, and all that then remained was simple butchery. Hunting down the ones who hid, who fled to the farthest reaches, the smallest storage rooms, the children huddling in alcoves and, for one, in an amphora half filled with wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than four bells, then, to annihilate the Cult of the Black-Winged Lord. These degenerate versions of Tiste Edur. Hardly worth the effort, as far as Orbyn Truthfinder was concerned. Even more bitter to the tongue, there had been no sign of Fear Sengar or any of his companions. No sign, indeed, that they had ever been here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze resting upon the heaped corpses, he felt sullied. Letur Anict had used him in his obsessive pursuit of efficiency, of cruel simplification of his world. One less nagging irritant for the Factor of Drene. And now they would return, and Orbyn wondered if this journey to track down a few wagonloads of cheap weapons had, in fact, been nothing more than a ruse. One that fooled him as easily as it would a wide-eyed child. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-256.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
