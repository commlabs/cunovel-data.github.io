You comin’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the One Ball Inn, a bar downtown. Don’t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said, “I gotta go to work in seven hours.” John had work, too. We both worked the same shift at the same video store. John had been through six jobs in three years, by the way. Some girl came up behind John and put her arms around him. I didn’t recognize her, but that was normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, me, too,” he admitted. “But I gotta buy Robert a beer first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, the black guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn gestured toward a group of five people, three girls and two dudes with their backs to me. One was a huge guy with red hair, next to him was the rainbow beret and dreadlocks of my voodoo priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See him? He’s the one in the white tennis shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only did I see him, but he turned toward me. He made eye contact and shouted, “You owe me a beer, mon!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man likes his beer,” said John. “Hey, I heard there was somebody from a record company out there tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like the guy, John. He’s . . . there’s something not right about him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You like so few people, Dave. He’s cool. He bet me a beer he could guess my weight. Got it on the first try. Amazing stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you even know how much you weigh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly. But he couldn’t have been off by more than a few pounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, first of all—never mind. John, the guy does an accent. What kind of a person goes around like that? He’s phony. Also, I think he might be, uh, into somethin’. Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ‘Into something’? You are so quick to judge. Have you thought that maybe he was raised by his father, who was a fugitive from the law? And that, to conceal his identity, his father had to fake an accent? And that maybe young Robert learned how to talk from his dad and thus adopted that same fake accent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what he told you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, John. My car is behind the trees back there. Come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you goin’ to the One Ball?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, obviously not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’m ridin’ with Head in the Flap Wagon. You’re still welcome to come if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI declined. They loaded up and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a little abandoned. There wasn’t anybody else I really knew there, so I wandered around for a bit, hoping to run into Jennifer Lopez or at least that dog. I did find Jennifer, where she was sitting in a cherry-red ’65 Mustang making out with that blond kid. He looked barely old enough to drive. This made me furious for some reason and I sulked my way back to my underfed Japanese economy car, shoes kicking up little sprays of moisture from the tall grass as I went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog was waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight there by my door, like it couldn’t understand what had taken me so long. I unlocked the door and “Molly” leapt into the passenger seat. I gawked, half expecting the dog to reach around with her teeth and pull down the seat belt. She didn’t. Just waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flung myself down into the little Hyundai, feeling like a thousand questions were squirming around my gut. I dug into my pocket for my car keys. I pulled my hand out—and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a full-fledged female-victim-in-a-slasher-movie scream. Just a harsh, rasping “WHAH?!?” On the palm of my hand, etched into the skin, was the phrase, YOU OWE ME ONE BEER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there, in the dark, staring at my hand. I did this for several minutes, felt my stomach clench, then decided to lean out the door and vomit in the weeds. I spat and opened my eyes, saw movement in the puddle. Something long and black and wriggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that’s where the centipede went . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my eyes shut and leaned back in my seat. In that moment I decided to go home and crawl into bed and pretend that none of this had ever, ever happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTELLING THE STORY now, I’m tempted to say something like, “Who would have thought that John would help bring about the end of the world?” I won’t say that, though, because most of us who grew up with John thought he would help end the world somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, in chemistry class, John “accidentally” made a Bunsen burner explode. I mean it actually shattered a window. He got suspended for ten days for that and if they could have proven it wasn’t an accident he’d have been expelled, as I was a year later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was kicked out of art class for submitting very, very detailed charcoal nudes of himself, only with about six inches added to his genitalia. He broke his wrist after a fall while trying to ride a friend’s van like a surfboard. He has burn scars on the back of his thighs from what he told me was a mishap with homemade fireworks, but what I believe was the result of his and some friends’ attempt to make a jet pack. He told me a year ago he wanted to go into politics some day, even though he didn’t have even one minute of college. A month ago he told me he wanted to go into the adult film industry instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thing in John’s Apartment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDARKNESS AND WARMTH. And then, an all-beep rendition of “La Cucaracha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell phone. I peeled my eyes open. Bedroom. Nighttime. My floor looked like a Laundromat explosion. Magazines here and there, overflowing trash can. Just as I had left it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeepbeepbeep BEEP, BEEP. Beepbeepbeep BEEP, BEEP. BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand managed to knock over every single object on my nightstand before it found the cell phone. I squinted at my clock, now lying helpless on the floor. Quarter after 5 A.M. I had to be at work in less than two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“David? It’s John. Where are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoice scratchy, breathing heavier than he should be. Like a man just after a fistfight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in bed. Where am I supposed to be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this the first time I’ve called tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat straight up, fully awake now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John? What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t get out of my apartment, Dave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m scared, man. I mean it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you scared of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It can’t be real, Dave. It can’t. The way it moves, the way it’s made . . . this is not a product of any kind of evolution or anything. It’s not real. No. But it still managed to bite me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you come over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne time, John wound up in the hospital after he blacked out behind the wheel of his car. He wasn’t moving at the time, thank God, but was in line at a Wendy’s drive-through. This was after five sleepless and foodless days of vodka and some combination of household chemicals he was using for speed. I didn’t know about it until a week later because he didn’t tell me, knowing I would have kicked his ass right there in the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I told him if he ever got into that kind of trouble again without telling me I would not only kick his ass, but would in fact beat him until he died, then pursue him into the afterlife and beat his eternal soul. So John being spaced out on crank or crack or skank tonight wasn’t reason to declare a national holiday, but at least he came to me this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I’ll be there in twelve minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up, pulled on some clothes I found draped over a chair, almost killed myself tripping over Molly the dog curled up in the doorway. I went out the front door with the dog in tow. It was raining again now, fat drops of April ice water that tingled down the back of my shirt as I ducked into my car. I was halfway to his building when my phone sang again. John’s number popped up on the glowing display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, John. You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dave, I’m sorry to wake you up. I got a problem and I need you to listen—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John, I’m on my way over. You called me five minutes ago, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? No, David. Stay away. There’s somethin’ in here with me. I can’t explain it. I don’t think it’ll kill me, it seems to just want to keep me here. Now, I need you to go to Las Vegas. Contact a man named—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John, just calm down. You’re not making sense. I want you to sit down somewhere, try to chill out. Nothin’ you’re seeing is real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause, then John asked, “How do I know this is really you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll know in just a few minutes. I’m comin’ up on your block now. Just chill, like I said. John?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody there. I sped up, rain drumming the windshield and boiling up into puddles on the passing pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pounding on the door to John’s apartment seven minutes later, still pounding on it five minutes after that. I considered going down and waking up his landlord when I tried the knob and realized the door had been unlocked the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark. No use looking for a switch—John’s only light was a floor lamp across the room and far be it from John to do something as rational as putting the light source where you could reach it from the door. Memory told me at least two pieces of furniture and probably twenty empty beer bottles stood between me and the lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing. I tried a tentative step into his apartment, my shoe kicking over a stack of magazines. I tried to step over them, cracked something glass or porcelain on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John? Can you hear me? I’m going to call the—ooomfff!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hammered by either a flying body tackle or an unnecessarily aggressive hug. My assailant and I landed hard on the carpet, pounding the breath from my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It almost killed you!” John screamed, inches from my face. “You’re an idiot, you know that? You’re an idiot for coming here. We’re both gonna die now. You could have brought help but now we’re both gonna die in this room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up off me and in the darkness I could detect his head whipping back and forth, as if searching for a sniper. He put one finger up to my face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1/page-8.html","bookId":2487,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM"}
