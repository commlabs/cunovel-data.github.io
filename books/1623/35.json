And now, Ysabell,\u0027 said Keli, setting her jaw, \u0027if you are to move in royal circles there are some people you simply must meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabell gave Mort a despairing look as she was swept away into the crowd, and was soon lost to view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort ran a finger around the inside of his collar, looked both ways, and then darted into a fern-shaded corner near the end of the buffet where he could have a quiet moment to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him the Master of Ceremonies cleared his throat. His eyes took on a distant, glazed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Stealer of Souls,\u0027 he said in the faraway voice of one whose ears aren\u0027t hearing what his mouth is saying, \u0027Defeater of Empires, Swallower of Oceans, Thief of Years, The Ultimate Reality, Harvester of Mankind, the —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I CAN SEE MYSELF IN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort paused with a cold turkey leg halfway to his mouth. He didn\u0027t turn around. He didn\u0027t need to. There was no mistaking that voice, felt rather than heard, or the way in which the air chilled and darkened. The chatter and music of the wedding reception slowed and faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We didn\u0027t think you\u0027d come,\u0027 he said to a potted fern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO MY OWN DAUGHTER\u0027S WEDDING? ANYWAY, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I\u0027VE EVER HAD AN INVITATION TO ANYTHING. IT HAD GOLD EDGES AND RSVP AND EVERYTHING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, but when you weren\u0027t at the service —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, yes, I suppose so —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO BE FRANK, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO MARRY THE PRINCESS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort blushed. \u0027We talked about it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Then we thought, just because you happen to rescue a princess, you shouldn\u0027t rush into things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVERY WISE. Too MANY YOUNG WOMEN LEAP INTO THE ARMS OF THE FIRST YOUNG MAN TO WAKE THEM AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS\u0027 SLEEP, FOR EXAMPLE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And, well, we thought that all in all, well, once I really got to know Ysabell, well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES, YES, I AM SURE. AN EXCELLENT DECISION.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOWEVER, I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO INTEREST MYSELF IN HUMAN AFFAIRS ANY FURTHER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEXCEPT OFFICIALLY, OF COURSE. IT WAS CLOUDING MY JUDGEMENT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA skeletal hand appeared on the edge of Mort\u0027s vision and skilfully speared a stuffed egg. Mort spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What happened?\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve got to know! One minute we were in the Long Room and the next we were in a field outside the city, and we were really us! I mean, reality had been altered to fit us in! Who did it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI HAD A WORD WITH THE GODS. Death looked uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh. You did, did you?\u0027 said Mort. Death avoided his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I shouldn\u0027t think they were very pleased.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE GODS ARE JUST. THEY ARE ALSO SENTIMENTALISTS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MASTER IT, MYSELF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBUT YOU AREN\u0027T FREE YET. YOU MUST SEE TO IT THAT HISTORY TAKES PLACE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Uniting the kingdoms and everything.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU MIGHT END UP WISHING YOU\u0027D STAYED WITH ME.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I certainly learned a lot,\u0027 Mort admitted. He put his hand up to his face and absent-mindedly stroked the four thin white scars across his cheek. \u0027But I don\u0027t think I was cut out for that sort of work. Look, I\u0027m really sorry —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath put down his plate of hors d\u0027oeuvres and fumbled in the mysterious recesses of his robe. When his skeletal hand emerged it was holding a little globe between thumb and forefinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about three inches across. It could have been the largest pearl in the world, except that the surface was a moving swirl of complicated silver shapes, forever on the point of resolving themselves into something recognisable but always managing to avoid it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Death dropped it into Mort\u0027s outstretched palm it felt surprisingly heavy and slightly warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOR YOU AND YOUR LADY. A WEDDING PRESENT. A DOWRY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s beautiful! We thought the silver toast rack was from you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT WAS ALBERT. I\u0027M AFRAID HE DOESN\u0027T HAVE MUCH IMAGINATION.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort turned the globe over and over in his hands. The shapes boiling inside it seemed to respond to his touch, sending little streamers of light arching across the surface towards his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it a pearl?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES. WHEN SOMETHING IRRITATES AN OYSTER AND CAN\u0027T BE REMOVED, THE POOR THING COATS IT WITH MUCUS AND TURNS IT INTO A PEARL. THIS IS A PEARL OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR. A PEARL OF REALITY. ALL THAT SHINY STUFF IS CONGEALED ACTUALITY. YOU OUGHT TO RECOGNISE IT – YOU CREATED IT, AFTER ALL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort tossed it gently from hand to hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We will put it with the castle jewels,\u0027 he said. \u0027We haven\u0027t got that many.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONE DAY IT WILL BE THE SEED OF A NEW UNIVERSE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort fumbled the catch, but reached down with lightning reflexes and caught it before it hit the flagstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE PRESSURE OF THIS REALITY KEEPS IT COMPRESSED. THERE MAY COME A TIME WHEN THE UNIVERSE ENDS AND REALITY DIES, AND THEN THIS ONE WILL EXPLODE AND . . . WHO KNOWS? KEEP IT SAFE. IT\u0027S A FUTURE AS WELL AS A PRESENT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath put his skull on one side. IT\u0027S A SMALL THING, he added. You COULD HAVE HAD ETERNITY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I\u0027ve been very lucky.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put it very carefully on the buffet table, between the quails\u0027 eggs and the sausage rolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE WAS ANOTHER THING, said Death. He reached under his robe again and pulled out an oblong shape inexpertly wrapped and tied with string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT\u0027S FOR YOU, he said, PERSONALLY. YOU NEVER SHOWED ANY INTEREST IN IT BEFORE. DID YOU THINK IT DIDN\u0027T EXIST?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort unwrapped the packet and realised he was holding a small leather-bound book. On the spine was blocked, in shiny gold leaf, the one word: Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leafed backwards through the unfilled pages until he found the little trail of ink, winding patiently down the page, and read: Mort shut the book with a little snap that sounded, in the silence, like the crack of creation, and smiled uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a lot of pages still to fill,\u0027 he said. \u0027How much sand have I got left? Only Ysabell said that since you turned the glass over that means I shall die when I\u0027m —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU HAVE SUFFICIENT, said Death coldly. MATHEMATICS ISNT ALL IT\u0027S CRACKED UP TO BE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How do you feel about being invited to christenings?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI THINK NOT. I WASN\u0027T CUT OUT TO BE A FATHER, AND CERTAINLY NOT A GRANDAD. I HAVEN\u0027T GOT THE RIGHT KIND OF KNEES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put down his wine giass and nodded at Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY REGARDS TO YOUB GOOD LADY, he said. AND NOW I REALLY MUST BE OFF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you sure? You\u0027re welcome to stay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT\u0027S NICE OF YOU TO SAY SO, BUT DUTY CALLS. He extended a bony hand. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort gripped the hand and shook it, ignoring the chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look,\u0027 he said. \u0027If ever you want a few days off, you know, if you\u0027d like a holiday —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMANY THANKS FOR THE OFFER, said Death graciously. I SHALL THINK ABOUT IT MOST SERIOUSLY. AND NOW —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Goodbye,\u0027 Mart said, and was surprised to find a lJump in his throat. \u0027It\u0027s such an unpleasant word, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUITE SO. Death grinned because, as has so often been remarked, he didn\u0027t have much option. But possibly he meant it, this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI PREFER AU REVOIR, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-35.html","bookId":1623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM"}
