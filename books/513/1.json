{"id":42269,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\u0026nbsp;Ron Carver\u0027s day was beginning strangely. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For one thing, the legs he swung off the narrow bed wouldn\u0027t touch the floor. And his hands, whose ten strong fingers could manipulate the controls of any ship ever launched into space, were weak and clumsy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked at the hands first, looked at them for a long time. Then he screamed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He screamed until footsteps were loud in the corridor outside his room; shrill, piping screams that didn\u0027t stop even when the giant woman-face was bending over him, speaking gentle, soothing words, stroking his thin shoulders with giant, comforting gestures.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There, there, now,\" the woman was saying. \"You\u0027re all right, Ronnie. You\u0027re all right. It was only a nightmare... a bad old nightmare....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was right. Only the nightmare hadn\u0027t ended. The nightmare was before his face, in her gargantuan features, in her motherly touch on his frail body, in the sight of the small, soft appendages that were his hands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were the hands of a boy of twelve. And Ron Carver was thirty years old.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Two men giants joined the woman at his bedside, and one of them forced a small speckled capsule past his resisting lips. Then his viewpoint became detached and distant, and a pleasurable drowsiness overcame him. He stretched out and shut his eyes, but he could still hear the worried tones of their speech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dr. Minton warned us,\" one of the men said, lifting Ron\u0027s bony wrist and feeling for the pulse. \"The boy has suffered some severe traumatic shock...\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Minton! Ron Carver\u0027s mind grasped the familiar name—the name of his own physician—gratefully. But his body gave no sign.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Maybe we better call him,\" the woman said nervously. \"I think he\u0027s still in the sick bay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good idea.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In another moment, a familiar hairy face was floating over Ron\u0027s head like a captive balloon, a face grown grotesque in size.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Doctor...\" he said with his lips.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There.\" Dr. Minton patted his shoulder. \"You\u0027re all right now, Ronnie. You\u0027re perfectly all right. Just relax and try to sleep.\" The balloon came closer, and the scraggly ends of the doctor\u0027s beard brushed his cheek. Then the doctor\u0027s mouth was covering his small ear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Play the game,\" the doctor whispered. \"For your own sake. Play the game, Ron...\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he was asleep.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3272/89515.html","bookId":513,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM"}
