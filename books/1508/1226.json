Perhaps because of the different natures of the monster’s soul and his human soul, Lin Ming found it extremely difficult to fuse with these memories. Even for the strange writing, Lin Ming had a great deal of difficulty understanding any of it. He had to comb through the memories for corresponding hints in order to make out some meaning from the words.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese memories were incredibly incomplete.

He only knew that it was an extremely abstract existence. But at the same time, the Heavenly Dao seemed to have a thought and will of its own, punishing anyone that dared to violate its edicts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, Lin Ming was finally aware.

It was like a thin layer of membrane had been pierced through, in that that moment, many truths and Laws were immediately comprehended by him. In that instant Lin Ming could feel his own strength crazily rise and his soul force was again strengthening at a terrifying speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s first four Concepts of Thunder and Fire completely fused together. And in his spiritual sea, his battle spirit also violently trembled. As it trembled, all of its power constantly gathered onto itself, becoming more and more solid and more and more sharp.

He discovered that the countless Law fragments that had buried themselves into his flesh during his Ninefall had begun to slowly fuse into his flesh. As for his Thunder and Fire Laws, in that moment just now they had instantly reached perfection of the first four Concepts. Lin Ming could even faintly feel himself touching upon the fifth level Concepts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just a few breaths of time, Lin Ming had obtained an immeasurable advantage. Although he had yet to break through a cultivation boundary, his practical strength had substantially increased. This was mainly manifested in the comprehension and use of his Laws as well as his battle spirit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming were to use his Heavenly Dao Judgment now, it would be even mightier than before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven if he were to use the most basic Penetrating Rainbow, Chasing Thunder, Chasing Sun, or Bury the Heavens, just a single strike would be able to easily kill a top 10 ranked core disciple of a Great World King Holy Land.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was overjoyed as he sensed the changes in his body.
