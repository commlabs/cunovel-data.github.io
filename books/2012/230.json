Or someone else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And on this our fate rests – that someone else cleans up the mess we make. I dare say our children will not appreciate the burden.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’ll not live long enough to appreciate much of anything,’ Errastas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI truly see our problem, friends. We don’t want the future, we want the past. With a new name. But it’s still the past, that invented realm of nostalgia, all the jagged edges smoothed away. Paradise … for the drinkers of blood .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Draconus seeks to do me harm,’ said Kilmandaros. ‘He waits for me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t be a fool,’ snapped Errastas. ‘He will join with T’iam in slaying the Otataral Dragon. He may have vowed eternal war against chaos, but even he would not welcome its end. Besides, a battle with you risks too much – you might kill him. He’s been imprisoned in a sword for how long? You think he’d risk his freedom so soon? Perhaps indeed he has old scores to settle with you, Kilmandaros, but he is about to discover far more immediate threats.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unless he gleans our purpose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul Lath glanced back at her. ‘Mother, I assure you, he has done that. But I think Errastas judges rightly. Draconus will see the threat posed by the release of the Otataral Dragon, and her presence will be his lodestone. Hopefully a fatal one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Many have tried to kill her,’ Errastas agreed, ‘and all have failed. Even the imprisonment demanded an elaborate trap – one that took centuries for Rake to devise.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He wasn’t alone,’ rumbled Kilmandaros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And what was made you have now unmade,’ Errastas said, nodding. ‘And Anomander Rake is dead, and there remains no one to match his insane obsessions—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros had drawn close during the conversation, and her hand was a sudden blur in the corner of Sechul’s vision, but the blow she struck Errastas was impossible to miss, as ribs snapped and he was thrown from his feet. He struck the ground, rolled once, and then curled up around the damage to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to stand over him. ‘You will cease speaking ill of him,’ she said in a low voice. ‘We did not always agree. Often we quarrelled. But the Son of Darkness was a man of integrity and honour. No longer will I permit you to spit on his name. He is dead, and your voice lives on like the cry of a cowardly crow, Errastas. You were never his match, and even in death he stands taller than you in all your guises. Do you think I do not hear your resentment? Your envy? It disgusts me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul Lath felt a trickle of power from Errastas, as the Elder God healed himself. Slowly, he regained his feet, and, not looking at either of them, resumed walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Sechul fell in behind the Errant, followed by Kilmandaros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, loud enough for both to hear, ‘Rake once said to me that Draconus was a man of great honour. Before the betrayal. Before his day of rage. I believe him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul turned and studied his mother. ‘You believe he will leave the Otataral Dragon to T’iam. That he will seek you out, not to settle old scores, but to punish you for what you have done here. To punish you for releasing her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Punish me?’ She bared her tusks. ‘He will seek to kill me, my son. And I am frightened.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe admission was like ice in Sechul’s veins. Mother? ‘We should never have done this,’ he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A common prayer,’ she muttered in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Farther still?’ Errastas demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros glanced behind them. ‘Farther still.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon circled him twice before descending to the broken tundra two hundred paces ahead. As Tulas Shorn walked closer, he watched it eyeing him warily. Scales like plates of ice, milky and translucent in places, blinding white where the sun’s light struck them full. Eyes red as blood. With less than fifty strides between them, the dragon sembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulas maintained his steady approach until ten paces away, and then he halted in alarm. ‘Is that a Hust blade you carry, Silchas Ruin? Such was not your style.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weapon was moaning, sensing the nearness of one possessing the blood of Eleint. One other than its wielder, that is .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin’s expression was flat. ‘It seems that you evaded their bargain – for there was a bargain, was there not? Between my brother and the Lord of the Slain. There had to have been.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine you are correct.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-230.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
