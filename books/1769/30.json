He\u0027d wanted other men to look at her— she\u0027d been dressed very similarly to Bride—and envy him, but he wanted to kill everyone who glanced at Bride. She was his. Right now, she was his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wife he was taking into a lion\u0027s den. I\u0027m seriously screwed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of Eden, he had killed a very important man in this seedy world. Everyone here knew it, and a few had tried to keep him out tonight. But he had placed the right amount of money in the right hands, so here he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released Bride and moved beside Dallas, who was no longer smiling and radiating good humor. Dallas was frowning, eyes slightly pained. A vision trying to kick its way inside his skull? Or was Dallas simply in agent mode, determined to protect Devyn from the vampires who had killed him in his latest vision?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they strode forward, Bride trailing behind them. He couldn\u0027t see her, but he could feel the energy she emitted. It was the only thing that relaxed him. They wound around cars, bypassing people strolling leisurely. At the front door, two armed guards greeted him. Ell-Rollises. Tall, hideously muscled, and torturously ugly. They had scaly yellow skin, and no nose that he could see. Maybe that was why they smelled so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe race made the perfect guard dogs, for they were completely susceptible to their owner\u0027s commands. Whatever was demanded of them, they performed to the letter. Nothing swayed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name?\" one asked in a gravelly voice. \"Devyn of the Targons. Two guests.\" The guard scanned the names on his computerized list and nodded. \"Armed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. Silly question. \"Of course I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All weapons must be removed,\" the second alien told him firmly. \"I meant I\u0027m armed with cash, puppy. Now get out of my way.\" Both sets of beady eyes roved over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" the second said. \"Not until you\u0027re cleared.\" He held up a small black box and, gazing at the screen, moved it over his body. An X-ray, Devyn was sure. But he wasn\u0027t armed in any fashion that could be detected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clean,\" the guard said, then scanned Dallas and Bride. \"Clean, as well.\" Both aliens moved aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn strode into the building, certain the others followed him. He frowned. There was a strange vibration wafting through the air, a vibration that prevented him from locking on a single individual\u0027s energy, so he could manipulate their actions. It was the same vibe he\u0027d gotten off Nolan, last time he\u0027d tried to fight the otherworlder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, fuck me, he thought next. They\u0027d somehow done it on purpose to keep him in line. Smart of them. Wouldn\u0027t stop him from killing someone, though. His gaze shifted through the decadent world he hadn\u0027t realized until just then that he\u0027d given up. He hadn\u0027t been in months, and hadn\u0027t wanted to come. Now he knew why. This wasn\u0027t where he belonged anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were leering at the women, and the women— those who weren\u0027t peering dejectedly at their feet—were sizing the men up. There was more skin displayed here than usually found in his bedroom. Twelve rows with twelve seats each stretched in front of him. Only the front row was already occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the far wall was a platform with three lines of people, both male and female, all orherworlders of some sort. They were chained, their arms anchored to a beam above them, and robed. Anyone wanting a sneak peek could saunter onto the platform and part those robes, touch, even taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of regret slammed through Devyn. Yes, regret. He\u0027d thought living this way would keep him from regrets. Now, the truth hit him and hit him hard; he was looking at things as Bride must. He\u0027d bought women who were traumatized by their treatment. Women who had been used and humiliated. Of course they\u0027d been happy to leave with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely they hadn\u0027t wanted him. Most likely they\u0027d only wanted freedom from this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn couldn\u0027t help himself. He reached back, slid his arm around Bride\u0027s waist, and tugged her beside him. He needed to feel her, to know she was here and that she wasn\u0027t leaving him. Yet. He needed her goodness to mute his darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t protest as he\u0027d expected. When would he learn that with her, he just needed to stop expecting? She always managed to surprise him. She even placed her palm on his lower back, under his jacket so no one could see, and grazed her nails over his shirt, tickling his skin to remind him of the pleasure they had shared together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleasure he hadn\u0027t allowed himself to enjoy for an entire week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad they been alone, he might have snatched her up, ripped those pants off her, and pushed her against the wall while pounding inside the sweetness of her body. Respect be damned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to examine the merchandise,\" Dallas said coldly, every inch the buyer he was supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn knew he wanted to find the vampires. \"This way.\" He released Bride and led them toward the stage, as whispers rose from the masses. Whispers about him, he was sure. What was he doing here? they wondered. Who was he with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they could leave the sitting area, however, a tall, muscled warrior stood up and turned, as though he was aware of Devyn\u0027s every movement. Devyn stilled abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough a year had passed, Devyn recognized the man instantly. McKell. The McKell. Power hummed from him in great waves, as though it was barely leashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDread coursed through Devyn, Dallas\u0027s warning echoing through his mind. You\u0027ll begin a chain of events ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire had pale skin and vivid violet eyes. Black-as-night hair. A perfect face, wide shoulders, and a thick body built for war. His fangs were so long, they protruded over his bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould this man, the first vampire Bride would see, appeal to her? Would she want to leave with the bastard? Good thing Devyn\u0027s wishes weren\u0027t the ones coming true. The entire place would have erupted into flame just then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move aside and allow her to see the warrior. Not yet. If he were lucky, they\u0027d get through this encounter without either Bride or McKell fully catching sight of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, hell,\" Dallas muttered. \"The countdown has begun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell was just about right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devyn of the Targons.\" McKell inclined his head in greeting. \"Id like to say it\u0027s a pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As would I.\" He\u0027d half admired the vamp and his cruelty until this moment. \"But alas. I can\u0027t without lying. What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many things. Since you told us of these auctions, we have come to buy back our own, as well as any meal that might strike our fancy.\" His purple gaze strayed to the form behind Devyn\u0027s back. Or tried to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn reached behind and ensnared Bride\u0027s arm, holding her in place so that she wouldn\u0027t inadvertently reveal herself. He\u0027d been to several auctions since returning the girls, but he\u0027d never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enoticed a vampire in the bidding crowd. \"Kind of takes you out of hiding, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving up on seeing his \"slave,\" the bloodsucker once more met his stare. \"We\u0027ve already been discovered. There\u0027s no longer any risk. Instead, we are now determined to show those who wrong us the error of their ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThreat received. And ignored. \"Well, I hope you enjoy the show. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse us ...\" He squeezed Bride\u0027s hand, pulling her beside him as he passed the vampire, still never really giving the man a good look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have known she\u0027d find a way to see who he\u0027d been talking to. Suddenly she jerked backward, stilled, gasped in disbelief. Then she gasped again, in pure pleasure this time. \"You\u0027re here,\" she said. \"You\u0027re really here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonderful. Devyn swung around, a wooden blade in his hand. Wood—because the X-ray only checked for metal. He pressed it into his thigh, ready to strike at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKell peered down at Bride\u0027s tattooed wrist for several heartbeats, silent. Then his gaze swung up, locking on Bride\u0027s face, seeming to drink her in. \"It\u0027s you,\" he said. \"It\u0027s really you. This is a day I have dreamed of for so long I can hardly believe it\u0027s finally here.\" There was awe in his voice. Awe and determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Devyn demanded, not liking the way they were looking at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKells attention remained fixed on Bride. \"I\u0027ve been searching for you, Maureen. Searching for my bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaureen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that my real name? Bride wondered. \"My tattoo—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t your name,\" the vampire in front of her said. A real vampire. She\u0027d known she would meet one tonight, but the fact that she had still managed to astound her. His teeth were longer and sharper than hers, and his skin was much paler. Was she the norm, or was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid it matter? All her life she\u0027d been waiting for this moment, desperate to find another like her. This man, this other vampire, was proof that she wasn\u0027t a simple anomaly, a mistake, a freak. He was proof that she belonged somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew me?\" she managed to work past the lump in her throat. The world around her was fading, the vampire—a real, live vampire!—becoming her sole focus. \"Before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior\u0027s gaze softened, turning the violet to a gentle blue. \"Of course. You were born to be mine. The tattoo is your mark. My mark. Proclaiming what you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKell\u0027s bride.\" He reached out, his thumb caressing the words in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. The tattoo was her title. Wow. Not that she wanted to marry this man. Or belong to him, whatever that meant in the vampire world. Her world. A tremor began in her hands and spread to her chest, her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have so many questions,\" she said. \"How did I get here? Was I sent away? Did I wander off? Do I have a mother?\" Bride forced herself to stop, not wanting to annoy him into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could answer a single question, someone passed their group from behind, and Devyn had to turn to avoid contact, which brushed his shoulder against hers and hers against McKell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she muttered, tingling from where Devyn had touched her but feeling no different where McKell had. Kind of like when the warrior had traced her tattoo; there\u0027d been no reaction. But at least the tingling from Devyn was like a jump start to her brain. Devyn. Auction. Crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No apology necessary, sweet Maureen. I welcome your touch.\" McKell scanned the area around them, even as Devyn growled low in his throat. \"Now is not the time to talk, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not, and there\u0027ll be no wishing it is,\" Devyn said through clenched teeth. His hand settled on her hips, his fingers spreading until they encountered bare skin. It was a possessive claim, a show of ownership. \"And her name is Bride. My Bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly he wasn\u0027t as happy as she was about this. He should be. McKell might be convinced to escort her to the underground, and Devyn could have his precious freedom back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paid no attention to the sudden ache in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKell shook with the force of his sudden ... fury? \"You skirt the edge of death, Targon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes. Fury. Thankfully no one seemed to be paying them any attention, but that could change at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn moved her aside, though he didn\u0027t release her, taking her place and putting himself nose to nose with the warrior. \"She\u0027s my wife. We\u0027ve exchanged blood. You know as well as I that she can no longer drink from anyone else. That means she is forever out of your reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" the warrior said, oh, so smug, \"that\u0027s not entirely true. She won\u0027t die without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now your desperation is showing. I watched a female vampire die because she had lost her man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By choice, Targon. She died by choice. Do you really think we would have survived as long as we have if we couldn\u0027t find a way around the blood sickness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot breath hissed between Devyn\u0027s teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a way around the sickness, Bride thought. One day she might be able to drink from someone else. Someone other than Devyn. The thought both delighted and saddened her. While she loved Devyn\u0027s blood, she didn\u0027t want to have to rely on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maureen, \"McKell said, \"is mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys,\" Dallas said when Devyn made as if to grab the newcomer by the shirt. \"Enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn straightened, smoothed his suit. \"Yes, no reason for upset on my part. I\u0027ve seen your moves. You need a bit more practice before you\u0027re ready for a tigress like Bride. And please, don\u0027t take offense. It\u0027s not an insult if it\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle ticked below McKells eyes as red bled into his irises. \"Once we\u0027ve weaned her off your blood, she will never again be able to see you. Never again be able to cross your path. What think you of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you need therapy, poor man.\" Devyn patted the top of McKell\u0027s head. \"Such delusions are probably dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo have someone else\u0027s blood meant she wouldn\u0027t be able to see Devyn ever again? Was McKell just taunting Devyn, or was that true?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vein looked ready to burst in McKell\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Devyn wrapped his arm around her, staking his claim. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s been trying to buy her off the streets, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKell gave a stiff nod. \"You\u0027ll find that when it comes to my female, I will do anything to get her back. Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven kill you. The threat hung in the air, unsaid, but just as menacing. Bride tried to step between them, but Devyn was having none of that. She would have wished them apart, but was too afraid of the consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you should know that I\u0027ll do anything to keep her,\" Devyn said. Devyn wanted to keep her? That was news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we should let the girl decide.\" McKell\u0027s attention settled on her, and his gaze softened. He reached out to smooth a strand of her hair behind her ear. Devyn batted his hand away. \"No touching. Ever.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-30.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
