It was morning break, and this was the most private place they could find at school. \"Thanks, Blaise. I needed that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe it was true. She\u0027d almost forgotten that she\u0027d used a spell to get him in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat should make a difference, she told herself. If it was all artificial, I shouldn\u0027t even miss it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still felt as if she were encased in ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Blaise tossed a ring on the high table. \"I asked her if I could look at it, then pretended I dropped it in the bushes. She\u0027s still out there searching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea pulled the binding spell out of her backpack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo anatomically correct dolls, both made with the blue wax Blaise used for her jewelry. Beautiful little creatures-Blaise was an artist. The male one contained the Kleenex with Eric\u0027s blood and a single sandy hair Thea had found clinging to her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea put Pilar\u0027s turquoise ring around the feet of the female doll and tied it with a red thread to keep it on. She held out a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her backpack, Blaise produced a corked hexagonal bottle. The liquid inside was made up of all sorts of disgusting things, including ground bezoar stone. Thea held her breath as she poured it over the two figures, which immediately began to smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now bind them together,\" Blaise said, coughing and waving a hand to clear a space to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Thea took a thin scarlet ribbon seven feet long and patiently began winding it around the two figures. It wrapped them like mummies. She tucked the loose end into a loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there they are,\" Blaise said. \"Bound till death. Congratulations. Let\u0027s see, it\u0027s ten fifteen now, so he should have forgotten your existence by about... say, ten sixteen.\" She reached up and her hair ran like black water through her hands as she stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea tried to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was bad. It was as if some part of Thea\u0027s physical body had been cut off. She felt raw and bleeding and not at all able to deal with things like French or trigonometry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be more to life. I\u0027ll go somewhere and do something for other people; I\u0027ll work in third world countries or try to save an endangered species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut thinking about future good works didn\u0027t help the raw ache. Or the feeling that if the ache stopped she would just be numb and never be happy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all this for a human...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t work anymore. She couldn\u0027t go back to her old way of thinking. Humans might be alien, but they were still people. They were as good as witches. Just different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to get through the schoolday without running into Eric-which mainly meant scuttling around corridors after bells rang and being tardy for classes. She was scuttling after the last bell toward Dani\u0027s U.S. government class when she almost collided with Pilar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thea!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was surprised. Thea looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep amber-brown eyes, framed by spiky black lashes. Pilar was looking at her very strangely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWondering at your good luck? Thea thought. Has Eric proposed to you yet? \"What?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePilar hesitated, then just shook her head and walked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea ducked into the history classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDani said, \"Thea!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody sounds the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027ve you been? Eric\u0027s looking all over for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I should have realized. Blaise was wrong-he\u0027s not just going to forget about me and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewalk away. He\u0027s a gentleman; he\u0027s going to tell me he\u0027s walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I go home with you?\" she asked Dani wretchedly. \"I need some space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thea...\" Dani dragged her to a corner and looked her over with anxious eyes. \"Eric really wants to find you... but what\u0027s wrong?\" she whispered. \"Is it something about Suzanne? The old gym\u0027s still closed, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing to do with that.\" She was about to suggest they get moving when a tall figure walked in the door. Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked straight to Thea. The kids hanging around the teacher\u0027s desk were looking. The teacher was looking. Thea felt like a freak show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to talk,\" Eric said flatly. She\u0027d never seen him look quite like this before. He was pale, glassy-eyed, hollow-cheeked. He somehow managed to look as if he\u0027d missed a week\u0027s worth of sleep since that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was right. They had to talk to end it. She had to explain that it was okay, or he\u0027d never be able to go. I can do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere private,\" Thea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left Dani and walked through the campus, past the old gym with its yellow ribbon of police tape hanging limp and still. Through the football field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea didn\u0027t know where they were going, and suspected Eric didn\u0027t either-they just kept moving until they were out of sight of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green of the tended grass gave way to yellow-green, and then brown, and then desert. Thea wrapped her arms around herself, thinking about how cold it had gotten in just a week and a half. The last trace of summer was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now we\u0027re going to talk about it, she thought as Eric stopped. Okay. I don\u0027t have to think, just say the right words. She forced herself to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned the haggard, haunted face on her and said, \"I want you to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny choice of words. You mean end it, break it off, put it quietly out of its misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t get all that out, so she just said, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing,\" he said, \"but I want it stopped. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis green eyes were level. Not apologetic, more like demanding. His voice was flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea had a sudden sense of shifting realities. All the hairs on her arms were standing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaught without a working brain, she said, \"I- what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I\u0027m talking about.\" He was still looking at her steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea shook her head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. It was a you-asked-for-it shrug. \"Whatever you\u0027re doing,\" he said with terrible distinctness, \"to try and make me like Pilar, it has got to stop. Because it\u0027s not fair to her. She\u0027s upset right now because I\u0027m acting crazy. But I don\u0027t want to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith her. It\u0027s you I love. And if you want to get rid of me, then tell me, but don\u0027t try and foist me off on somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea listened to the whole speech feeling as if she were floating several feet above the ground. The sky and desert seemed too bright, not warm, just very shiny. While her brain ran around frantically like Madame Curie in a new cage, she managed to get out, \"What could I possibly have to do-with you liking Pilar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked around, found a rock, and sat on it. He stared down at his hands for a minute or so. Finally he looked up, his expression helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a break, Thea,\" he said. \"How stupid do you think I am?\" Oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Then she thought, don\u0027t just stand there. You bluffed him before. You talked him out of knowing he\u0027d been bitten by a snake. For Earth\u0027s sake, you can talk him out of whatever he\u0027s thinking now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric-I guess we\u0027ve all been under a lot of stress....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please don\u0027t give me that.\" He seemed to be talking to a clump of silver cholla, eyeing the halos of awful spines as if he might jump into them. \"Please don\u0027t give me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath and spoke deliberately. \"You charm snakes and read guinea pigs\u0027 minds. You cure rattler bites with a touch. You tap into people\u0027s brains. You make up magical potpourri bags and your insane cousin is the goddess Aphrodite.\" He looked at her. \"Did I miss anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea found another rock and backed up to it blindly. She sat. Of everything in the universe, right then what she was most aware of was her own breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have this feeling,\" Eric said, watching her with his green eyes, \"that you guys are in fact the descendants of good old Hecate Witch-Queen. Am I dose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you win a prize?\" Thea still couldn\u0027t think, couldn\u0027t put a meaningful remark together. Could only gabble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused and grinned, a wry and painful grin, but the first one she\u0027d seen today. Then the smile faded. \"It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it?\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea looked out over the desert, toward the huge, bare cliffs of rock in the distance. She let her eyes unfocus, soaking in the expanse of brown-green. Then she put her ringers to the bridge of her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to do something that all her ancestors would condemn her for, something that nobody she\u0027d grown up with would understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed out, a lonely human figure in that vastness of the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you known?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... don\u0027t know. I mean, I think I always sort of knew. But it wasn\u0027t possible-and you didn\u0027t want me to know. So I didn\u0027t know.\" A kind of excitement was creeping into his haggardness. \"It\u0027s really true, then. You can do magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay it, Thea told herself. You\u0027ve done everything else. Say the words to a human. \"I\u0027m a witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Hearth-Woman, I thought you called it. That\u0027s what Roz was telling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that, Thea was horrified out of her daze of horror. Stricken. \"Eric-you can\u0027t talk about this with Roz. You don\u0027t understand. They\u0027ll kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t look as shocked as she might have expected. \"I knew you were scared of something. I thought it was just that people might hurt you-and your grandma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will; they\u0027ll kill me. But they\u0027ll kill you and Roz, too-and your mom and any other human they think may have learned about them-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, floundered a moment, and then made the ultimate betrayal of her upbringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called the Night World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said slowly, half an hour later. They were sitting side by side on his rock. Thea wasn\u0027t touching him, although her whole side was aware of his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so basically, the descendants of Maya are lamia and the descendants of Hellewise are witches. And together they\u0027re all this big secret organization, the Night World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Thea had to fight the instinct to whisper. \"It\u0027s not just lamia and witches, though. It\u0027s shape-shifters and made vampires and werewolves and other things. All the races that the human race couldn\u0027t deal with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires,\" Eric muttered to the cholla, his eyes going glassy again. \"That\u0027s what really gets me, real\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires. I don\u0027t know why, it follows logically....\" He looked at Thea, his gaze sharpening. \"Look, if all you people have supernatural powers, why don\u0027t you just take over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough of us,\" Thea said. \"And too many of you. It doesn\u0027t matter how supernatural we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, look-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You breed much faster, have more children-and you kill us whenever you find us. The witches were on the verge of extinction before they got together with the other races and formed the Night World. And that\u0027s why Night World law is so strict about keeping our secrets from humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s why you tried to hand me over to Pilar,\" Eric said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea could feel his eyes on her like a physical sensation. She stared at a patch of rock nettle between her feet. \"I didn\u0027t want you dead. I didn\u0027t want me dead, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027d really kill us for being in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched her shoulder. Thea could feel warmth spread from his hand and she had to work to make sure she didn\u0027t tremble. \"Then we\u0027ll keep it a secret,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric, it\u0027s not like that. You don\u0027t understand. There\u0027s nowhere we could go, no place we could hide. The Night People are everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they all follow these same rules.\" \"Yes. It\u0027s what allows them to survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed for a moment, then said in a voice that had gone husky, \"There\u0027s got to be a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I let myself think-for a while.\" Her own voice sounded shaky. \"But we have to face reality. The only chance we have of even living through this is for us to just go our separate ways. And for you to try as hard as you can to forget me and everything I\u0027ve told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trembling now, and her eyes had filled. But her hands were balled into fists and she wouldn\u0027t look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thea-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears spilled. \"I won\u0027t be your death!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I can\u0027t forget you! I can\u0027t stop loving you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, and maybe that was just a spell, too,\" she said, sniffling. Tears were falling straight off her face and onto the rock. Eric looked around for something to give her, then tried to wipe her wet cheeks with his thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whacked his hand away. \"Listen to me. You did miss something when you were adding up what I did. I also make love spells for me. I put one on you, and that\u0027s why you fell in love in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric didn\u0027t look impressed. \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did I put the spell on you? The day I asked you to the dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thea.\" He shook his head. \"Look,\" he said gently, \"I fell in love with you before that. It was when we were out here with that snake. When we just looked at each other and... and... I saw you surrounded by mist and you were the most beautiful thing in the world.\" He shook his head again. \"And maybe that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas magic, but I don\u0027t think it was any spell you were putting on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea wiped her eyes on her sleeve. Okay, so the yemonja had nothing to do with it. Anyway, love spells just seemed to bounce off Eric-even the dolls hadn\u0027t worked....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bent suddenly and picked up her backpack. \"And I don\u0027t know why this didn\u0027t work,\" she muttered. She took out a quilted makeup bag, unzipped it, and reached inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dolls came out as a bundle. At first glance they looked all right. Then Thea saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male doll had turned around. Instead of being face-to-face with the female doll, it had its back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarlet ribbon was still wound tightly around them. There was no way that it could have slipped, that this could have happened by accident. But the dolls had been inside the case, and the case had been inside her backpack all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric was watching. \"That\u0027s Pilar\u0027s ring. Hey, is that the spell on me and Pilar? Can I see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, why not?\" Thea whispered. She felt dazed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it couldn\u0027t have been an accident, and no human could have done it. And no witch could have done it either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there was a magic stronger than spells. Maybe the soulmate principle was responsible, and if two people were meant to be together, nothing could keep them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric was gingerly unwinding the scarlet ribbon. \"I\u0027ll give the ring back to Pilar,\" he said. He reduced the binding spell to its constituent parts, put them gently back in the makeup bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always loved you,\" he said. \"The only question is...\" He broke off and looked like the shy Eric she knew again. \"Is, do you love me?\" he finished at last. His voice was soft, but he was looking at her steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there are some things you just can\u0027t fight....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made herself look at him. The image wobbled and split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" she whispered. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen, but I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fell-slow as a dream, but still falling-into each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a problem,\" Thea said some time later. \"Besides all the other problems. I\u0027m going to be doing something next week, and I just need you to give me some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to tell me,\" he said calmly, his breath against her hair. \"You have to tell me everything now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s magic stuff and it\u0027s dangerous-\" A second too late she realized her mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, dangerous?\" He straightened up. His voice told her the peaceful interlude was over. \"If you think I\u0027m going to let you do something dangerous by yourself...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore her down. He was good at that-even better than his sister-and Thea was no good at refusing him. In the end she told him about Suzanne Blanchet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dead witch,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A spirit. And a very angry one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think she\u0027s coming back,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she\u0027s been here all along. Maybe hanging around the old gym, which hasn\u0027t done her any good since nobody\u0027s been there assaulting dummies. But if they open it to have the Halloween party...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be full of humans, all visiting those booths, all reminding her of what she hates. She can pick them off like ticks off a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. I think it could be bad. So what I\u0027ve got to do is quietly lure her somewhere else and then send her back where she came from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how are you going to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Thea rubbed her forehead. The sun was dipping toward the cliffs and long afternoon shadows had fallen across the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a plan,\" Eric said matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot you, Thea thought. I promised myself I wouldn\u0027t use you. Not even to save lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a plan you think is dangerous for humans. For me, since I\u0027m going to be helping you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not use you....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s make this easy on everybody. You know I\u0027m not going to let you do it alone. We might as well take that as given and go on from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the crazy guy who ignores snakebites and attacks people with punch, she reminded herself. Do you really expect to talk him out of helping you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if something were to happen to him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came back again, and Thea didn\u0027t understand it and she didn\u0027t like it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould you give up everything? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-spellbinder-night-world-3/page-13.html","bookId":2077,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:35:57 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:35:57 AM"}
