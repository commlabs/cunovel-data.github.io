But then she went and challenged me. “Then why aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged my hands free, which made her suck in a startled breath. But instead of going for the light switch, my fingers attacked her hair, burying themselves deep and giving a tug, which she’d seemed to like as much as last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I like this game,” I hissed in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod,” she chanted her orgasm mantra, telling me she was right there. Then the walls of her sex collapsed around my dick, squeezing tight as she came. “Oren.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer use of my first name was what tipped me over the edge. I’d wanted to wait until she was done, then try to build her up again, but her orgasm seemed to clutch me by the balls and had me releasing deep inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, damn it.” I clenched my teeth and bucked my hips wildly, lifting her from the bed as I tried to hold it back. And failed. “Caroline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt so good, I couldn’t even think as I pulled her hair and slammed up into her again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she collapsed on top of me, that thing she was wearing thunked against my chest again. A cool metal chain was connected to it, so I figured it was a necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilken hair fluttered over my arm as she nestled her cheek on my shoulder. It felt nice. I knew I could keep her there just like that forever and be completely content. But that thing still resting on my chest piqued my curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?” I asked as I dipped my face to feather my lips down her neck until I had a mouthful of the chain and gave it a small tug. I picked up the amulet with my fingers and felt out its shape. Sadness rocked through me because I couldn’t remember Caroline ever wearing anything so large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t like proof that Midnight Visitor wasn’t her, even though they were beginning to separate in my mind and become two different people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a necklace,” she murmured, her voice amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm.” Maybe Caroline just wore it under her shirt. That wasn’t completely unrealistic. It was about as realistic as me admitting Midnight Visitor was her. I continued to trace the rounded oval shape before I pressed it back to her chest and outlined it with my tongue. She let out a hum of pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does it mean anything special to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers drifted into my hair, making my scalp tingle. “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled and lifted my face when she didn’t elaborate. “But you’re not going to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really want to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. Kind of, yeah. I was beginning to grow very curious about my midnight visitor. I wanted to know all kinds of things, including, apparently, the importance of her necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more time I spent with this woman, the more confused I grew. Whoever I was with now was getting under my skin. She knew how to draw me out. Or maybe I’d allowed myself to grow closer to her because I secretly wanted her to be Caroline. Either way, what we had here between us was pretty sweet, yet I felt like shit because she was a true, live person that I was using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, this wasn’t Caroline. This was someone I could actually be with, so why couldn’t I stop imagining she was someone else and just...be with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnease stirred within me. There were reasons why I hadn’t had a steady girlfriend in four years, why I didn’t let myself stay long with one chick, why I refused to let myself open up and let anyone in. But meeting Caroline a year ago had changed all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now that I’d loosened my ways for her, this woman here was trying to squeeze in too. That panicked me. I had no clue what she looked like or what her name was, but the girl with me right now had a hold on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had thought I liked the mystery of not knowing who she was. But now I was curious. Tracing my finger down the middle of her chest between her breasts, I kissed her cheek. My gut clenched, because I knew a small part of me would be disappointed. I’d been having fun daydreaming she was Caroline, but I was going to have to get over my obsession with her. And this woman was the closest I’d ever come to what I felt for Gamble’s little sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI buried my face in her neck. With our arms and legs wrapped up in each other, I felt as close to her as I’d ever felt to another living human, and yet I also felt worlds apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what I was hiding. But what the hell was she hiding? Why didn’t she want me to see who she was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been working on my portfolio,” I said, hoping if I shared something about me, she’d share something about herself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-45.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
