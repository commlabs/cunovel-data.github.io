Could’ve taken my fingers off, if I’d caught them in that bear-trap of a face. You keep it away from me, Edwin. Keep it away or I’ll pull it apart, and turn it into a can opener.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Edwin’s very own eyes, Ted’s head turned with a series of clicks, until the machine fully faced the doctor. And if its eyes had been more than glass bits that were once assigned to a badger, then they might have narrowed or gleamed; but they were only glass bits, and they only cast back the fragments of light from the bright things in the laboratory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ted, come here. Ted, come with me,” Edwin said, gently pulling the automaton down from the table. “Ted, no one’s going to turn you into a can opener. Maybe you got wound funny, or wound too tight,” he added, mostly for the doctor’s benefit. “I’ll open you up and tinker, and you’ll be just fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the corner the doctor relaxed, and dropped the scissors. He set the screwdriver down beside a row of test tubes and placed both hands down on the table’s corner. “Edwin?” he said, so softly that Edwin almost didn’t hear him. “Edwin, did we finish breakfast? I don’t see my plate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes sir,” the boy swore. He clutched Ted closely, and held the automaton away from the doctor, out of the man’s line of sight should he turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. I suppose that’s right,” he said, and again Ted had been spared by the doctor’s dementia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin stuck Ted down firmly between the wall and his cot, and for one daft moment he considered binding the machine’s feet with twine or wire to keep it from wandering. But the thought drifted out of his head, chased away by the unresponsive lump against the wall. He whispered, “I don’t know how you’re doing it, but you need to stop. I don’t want the doctor to turn you into a can opener.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as a compromise to his thoughts about hobbling the automaton, he dropped his blanket over the thing’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBedtime was awkward that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached for the clockwork boy he remembered the slow, calculated turn of the machine’s head, and he recalled the blinking bright flashes of firelight in the glass badger eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor had settled in his nook and was sleeping, and Edwin was still awake. He reclaimed his blanket and settled down on his side, facing the wall and facing Ted until he dozed, or he must have dozed. He assumed it was only sleep that made the steel jaw lower and clack; and it was only a dream that made the gears twist and lock into syllables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ted?” Edwin breathed, hearing himself but not recognizing the sound of his own word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the clockwork face breathed back, not its own name but something else–something that even in the sleepy state of midnight and calm, Edwin could not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy asked in the tiniest whisper he could muster, “Ted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed’s steel jaw worked, and the air in its mouth made the shape of a, “No.” It said, more distinctly this time, and with greater volume, “Tan…gle…foot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin closed his eyes, and was surprised to learn that they had not been closed already. He tugged his blanket up under his chin and could not understand why the rustle of the fabric seemed so loud, but not so loud as the clockwork voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must be asleep, he believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, eventually, he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough not for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sleep was not good. He was too warm, and then too cold, and then something was missing. Through the halls of his nightmares mechanical feet marched to their own tune; in the confined and cluttered space of the laboratory there was movement too large to come from rats, and too deliberate to be the random flipping of a switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin awakened and sat upright in the same moment, with the same fluid fear propelling both events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reason for it, or so he told himself; and this was ridiculous, it was only the old Dr. Smeeks and his slipping mind, infecting the boy with strange stories–turning the child against his only true friend. Edwin shot his fingers over to the wall where Ted ought to be jammed, waiting for its winding and for the sliding of the button on its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he felt only the smooth, faintly damp texture of the painted stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands flapped and flailed, slapping at the emptiness and the flat, blank wall. “Ted?” he said, too loudly. “Ted?” he cried with even more volume, and he was answered by the short, swift footsteps that couldn’t have belonged to the doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his bed in the nook at the other end of the laboratory, the doctor answered with a groggy groan. “Parker?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes sir!” Edwin said, because it was close enough. “Sir, there’s…” and what could he say? That he feared his friend had become unhinged, and that Ted was fully wound, and roaming?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it, son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor’s voice came from miles away, at the bottom of a well–or that’s how it sounded to Edwin, who untangled himself from the sheets and toppled to the floor. He stopped his fall with his hands, and stood, but then could scarcely walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a matter of necessity he dropped his bottom on the edge of the cot and felt for his feet, where something tight was cinched around his ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, he found a length of wire bent into a loop and secured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hobbled his legs together, cutting his stride in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parker?” the doctor asked, awakening further but confused. “Boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin forced his voice to project a calm he wasn’t feeling. “Sir, stay where you are, unless you have a light. My friend, Ted. He’s gotten loose again. I don’t want…I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t find my candle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t find mine either,” Edwin admitted. “You stay there. I’ll come to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut across the floor the marching feet were treading steadily, and the boy had no idea where his automaton had gone. Every sound bounced off glass or wood, or banged around the room from wall to wall; and even the blue-gold shadows cast by the shimmering solutions could not reveal the clockwork boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin struggled with the bizarre bind on his legs and stumbled forward regardless of it. No matter how hard his fingers twisted and pulled the wires only dug into his skin and cut it when he yanked too sharply. He gave up and stepped as wide as he could and found that, if he was careful, he could still walk and even, in half-hops and uneven staggers, he could run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis light was nowhere to be found, and he gave up on that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, I’m coming!” he cried out again, since the doctor was awake already and he wanted Ted to think he was aware, and acting. But what could Ted think? Ted was only a collection of cogs and springs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin remembered the red-haired Madeline with the strap-marks on her wrists. She’d said Ted had no soul, but she’d implied that one might come along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness baffled him, even in the laboratory he knew by heart. Hobbled as he was, and terrified by the pattering of unnatural feet, the basement’s windowless night worked against him and he panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed help, but where could it come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orderlies upstairs frightened him in a vague way, as harbingers of physical authority; and the doctors and nurses might think he was as crazy as the other children, wild and loud–or as mad as his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Madeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name tinkled at the edge of his ears, or through the nightmare confusion that moved him in jilting circles. Maybe Madeline knew something he didn’t–maybe she could help. She wouldn’t make fun of him, at any rate. She wouldn’t tell him he was frightened for nothing, and to go back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew where her room was located; at least he knew of its wing, and he could gather its direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairs jabbed up sharp and hard against his exploring fingers, and his hands were more free than his feet so he used them to climb–knocking his knees against each angle and bruising his shins with every yard. Along the wall above him there was a handrail someplace, but he couldn’t find it so he made do without it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crawled so fast that his ascent might have been called a scramble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated to leave the doctor alone down there with Ted, but then again, the doctor had taken up the screwdriver and the scissors once before. Perhaps he could be trusted to defend himself again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of the stairs Edwin found more light and his eyes were relieved. He stood up, seized the handrail, and fell forward because he’d already forgotten about the wire wrapped around his ankles. His hands stung from the landing, slapping hard against the tile floor, but he picked himself up and began a shuffling run, in tiny skips and dragging leaps down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gurney loomed skeletal and shining in the ambient light from the windows and the moon outside. Edwin fell past it and clipped it with his shoulder. The rattling of its wheels haunted him down the hallway, past the nurse’s station where an elderly woman was asleep with the most recent issue of Harper’s New Monthly Magazine lying across her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t budge, not even when the gurney rolled creakily into the center of the hallway, following in Edwin’s wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the right wing, he whispered, “Madeline? Madeline, can you hear me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the windows in the doors to the inmate rooms were well off the ground and Edwin wasn’t tall enough to reach, so he couldn’t see inside. He hissed her name from door to door, and eventually she came forward. Her hands wrapped around the bars at the top, coiling around them like small white snakes. She held her face up to the small window and said, “Boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dashed to the door and pushed himself against it. “Madeline? It’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The boy.” Her mouth was held up to the window; she must have been standing on her tip-toes to reach it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin stood on his tip-toes also, but he couldn’t touch the window, high above his head. He said, “I need your help. Something’s wrong with Ted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he heard only her breathing, rushed and hot above him. Then she said, “Not your Ted any longer. I warned you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tanglefoot-the-clockwork-century-1-2/page-5.html","bookId":1673,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:13 PM"}
