{"id":103712,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite a spread of tucker, mate,\" Ben acknowledged, hefting a tin plate from the major\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since we haven\u0027t had hot food since breakfast yesterday, I thought everyone could use a big meal.\" Michaelson filled Ben\u0027s plate with a tap of his ladle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley took a smaller helping and sat down on a flat boulder. Khalid and Linda were already seated around the campstove, forkfuls eagerly being consumed. Villanueva sipped at his chicken broth, lustfully eyeing their greasy meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Michaelson was settled in with them, Ashley spoke up. \"We need to decide a course of action from here. We have only supplies for another eight days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNods and chewing were her only answer; the others waited for her to elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our options are to go back and try to make it through monster alley back there; stay here and hope that after a period of time the lack of radio contact may generate a search party; or push forward and try to find an alternate route up, knowing that there may be other nasties awaiting us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda put down her fork. \"I think we should stay here. Eventually someone will come looking for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" said Michaelson, \"but consider the previous team. We were sent three months after the first. It could be a long wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true,\" said Ben, \"and those beasts will be waiting for them too. It\u0027s not fair to ask someone to walk into the same lion\u0027s den without warning. And going back through there ourselves is not an option. I say we push on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley nodded. She felt the same way, but there were other concerns to take into account. She pointed to Villanueva. \"We have an injured teammate here, and additional traveling will risk further injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva lowered the bowl from his lips. \"I\u0027ll manage just fine. I know how far I can push myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley looked over at him. \"I\u0027m sure you do. But what if we run into more trouble? Your injuries are a serious hardship on the mobility of the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that happens, then leave me behind. Don\u0027t risk the team for my sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noble words, but it\u0027s us abandoning you. I, for one, won\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either, bloke. If we get in a scrape, we all go or no one goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva shook his head and raised the broth to his lips. \"Civiliansâ€¦\" he mumbled across the steaming bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhalid spoke up. \"So then, what do we do? Push forward or not? It sounds like we\u0027re damned if we do and damned if we don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a suggestion,\" Ashley said. \"We split up. Linda and Khalid stay here with Villanueva where it\u0027s safe. The rest of us will head out. We\u0027ll try to find a way back up and come down with a rescue team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was quiet as they pondered her plan, then Michaelson nodded. \"It\u0027s a sound plan. An efficient team has a good chance of making it back up. But, Ashley, there\u0027s no reason for you to come along. Ben and I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen interrupted. \"The major\u0027s right. Two could move faster than three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit. I can move as fast as you, and I\u0027m a sharper shot. Besides, the more eyes watching the trail, the better. I\u0027m going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men tried to beat her down with stubborn stares, but she didn\u0027t budge. Finally, Ben turned to Michaelson. \"It\u0027s a lost cause, mate. We got us some female company. Have to watch our language and be careful where we spit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Michaelson said. \"Then let\u0027s divvy up the supplies and get going. We\u0027re gonna have to travel light. Just the necessities: guns, radio, canteens, ropes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley picked up her holstered pistol. \"And lots of ammunition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhalid stood off to the side as the others readied themselves for the journey. From under heavy brows, he eyed Ben and Michaelson packing supplies. Villanueva struggled to be of use, disassembling the radio and wrapping key components in waterproof seals. Khalid studied the SEAL, weighing the strength left in Villanueva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda stepped beside him. \"Look at this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s actually a phosphorescent species of mold growing within this diamond.\" She cupped the glassy chunk in her hands and leaned close to him, blocking out the surrounding light, her hair brushing his cheek. \"See!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golf-ball-sized crystal glowed a soft yellow between her palms. \"Why don\u0027t you add it to your specimens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecimens? It took him a heartbeat to understand her. Then he realized she meant the collection of fist-sized diamonds he had stored in his pack. He\u0027d told her they were geologic samples, scientific research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" he said, accepting her gift. He fumbled his bag open and snuggled the diamond carefully among the others. He ran a finger across the other diamonds. Twelve of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of his employer\u0027s desire, he wasn\u0027t leaving this cavern empty-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda watched with mixed feelings as the others exited through the wormhole. She waffled between trepidation that the team was splitting up and relief that she was safely ensconced in a cavern secure from the predators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noted Khalid had already returned to studying the diamonds; he seemed fixated on the wealth around them, constantly drawn back to collecting stray fragments. Villanueva dozed nearby on his mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly she stared as Ben\u0027s light faded around a curve in the wormhole. She wondered what new discoveries they would encounter, what marvels she would miss by staying behind. A small spark of envy tried to blossom into a flame, but the horrors that could also lay ahead lessened her regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing around the small cavern, iridescent in the lamplight, she smiled at the thought that she, Linda Furstenburg, claustrophobic extraordinaire, was happy to be trapped in a confining chamber miles below the earth\u0027s surface. Let the others discover new wonders. At least here she wouldn\u0027t be something\u0027s dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed to the miniature laboratory she had set up. Besides, there was plenty to research right here. She sat down and checked her figures twice, then monitored the new hyphae growth under a microscope. She pulled out a slide of the older fungus and studied it too. \"My god, if that isn\u0027t a chloroplast,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva, who had been dozing nearby, opened an eye. \"Are you talking to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda blushed. \"No, sorry. It\u0027s just this mold is fascinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva pushed into a seated position, obviously still groggy, but bored too. \"What did you find?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought at first it was a dimorphic species, two forms of the same fungus. But now I don\u0027t think so. I think they are two unique species surviving symbiotically. Each sustaining the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lost me, Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One type of mold-the one with glowing hyphae-gets its energy from hydrogen sulfide in the trace volcanic gases, but its rate of growth is too fast to attribute to the amount of gas present. Plus it wastes a lot of energy to produce the glow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how come it does that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just it! There\u0027s a second species of fungus interwoven with it. This second fungus is full of a type of chloroplast!\" She pointed at the microscope slide as proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SEAL shrugged. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the second fungus uses the glowed energy from the first, like a plant uses sunlight. It feeds on this energy and in turn not only thrives, but also produces hydrogen sulfide gas to feed its glowing counterpart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So each mold feeds the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly! But obviously there must be more to it. More energy is needed to sustain this relationship. Whether from thermal heat, or from something in the rocks here, or from decomposition, or something else. I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s so much to learn. I could spend years studying just this relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva seemed to be losing interest in her revelation. \"Uh-huh. I\u0027d still rather just get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too, but the fungus explains a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" Villanueva yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like why the predators down here still have eyes. Why they camouflage so well with the rock. It was strange why creatures isolated for millennia in perpetual darkness should still have eyes and need to blend into the background. Most isolated cavern species are blind and albino due to the darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm. So what you\u0027re saying is that these creatures have been mostly hanging out in lighted areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or at least at their fringes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good to know. So anywhere there\u0027s fungus, there might be predators around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley noted two things as soon as she exited the newest wormhole. It was getting damned hotter, and the fungus grew thicker and brighter the farther they descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been traveling for half a day now, stopping only to check the radio periodically. No one ever answered their call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better conserve our batteries while we can,\" Ben said. \"The glow here is sufficient to see by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. When all the lights were turned off, she could see just fine. She wiped her brow. The cavern ahead was spotted with bubbling pools of steaming water, the room as hot as a sauna. It reeked of rotten eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen offered her a sip from his canteen. \"We must be approaching a hot vent of the volcano.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"We need a way up. Soon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson called from yards away, \"Your wish has been granted, Ashley. There\u0027s a crack over here. It\u0027s scalable and seems to climb at least a hundred yards up. This may be the break we were searching for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley hurried over to him. She would climb a sheer cliff if she could get away from this sulfurous heat. She clicked her flashlight back on and probed the way up. The fissure was craggy, with many handholds and footholds. The top extended beyond her light. Excellent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen approached her side. \"There\u0027s another wormhole on the south wall. It heads down again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares? We\u0027re going this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen peered up. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" She gave him a perturbed look. \"This is perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t tell where it ends. Who says it ends in a chamber? It may just peter out.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-31.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
