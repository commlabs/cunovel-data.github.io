{"id":88708,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy the time Rashel intercepted the girl, the truck was already braking to turn around. Someone was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshouting, \"She\u0027s out! We lost one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way!\" Rashel said, reaching toward the girl with one hand and gesturing with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp close, she could see that the girl was small, with disheveled blond hair falling over her forehead. Her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echest was heaving. Instead of looking grateful, she seemed terrified by Rashel\u0027s arrival. She stared at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel a moment, then she tried to dart away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel snagged her in midlunge. \u0027Tm your friend! Come on! We\u0027ve got to go between streets, where the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etruck can\u0027t follow us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck was finishing its turn. Headlights swept toward them. Rashel looped an arm around the girl\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewaist and took off at a dead run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond girl was carried along. She whimpered but she ran, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel was heading for the area between two of the warehouses. She knew that if there really were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires in that truck, her only chance was to get herself and the blond girl to her car. The vampires\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould run much faster than any human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d picked these two warehouses because the chain-link fence behind them wasn\u0027t too high and had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno barbed wire at the top. As they reached it, Rashel gave the girl a little shove. \"Climb!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t!\" The girl was trembling and gasping. Rashel looked her over and realized that it was probably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe literal truth. The girl didn\u0027t look as if she\u0027d ever climbed anything in her life. She was wearing what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to be party clothes and high heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel saw the truck\u0027s headlights in the street and heard the engine slowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to!\" she said. \"Unless you want to go back with them.\" She interlocked her fingers, making a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estep with her hands. \"Here! Put your foot here and then just try to grab on when I bounce you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked too scared not to try. She put her foot in Rashel\u0027s hand-just as the headlights switched\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was what Rashel had expected. The darkness was an advantage to the vampires; they could see much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetter in it than humans. They were going to follow on foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel took a breath, then heaved upward explosively as she exhaled. The blond girl went sailing toward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe top of the fence with a shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bare instant later, Rashel launched herself at the top of the fence, grabbed it, and swung her legs over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped to the ground almost noiselessly and held her arms up to the blond girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Let go! I\u0027ll catch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl, who was clambering awkwardly over the top, looked over her shoulder. \"I can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl dropped. Rashel broke her fall, set her on her feet, and grabbed her arm above the elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they ran, Rashel scanned the buildings around them. She needed a corner, someplace where she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould get the girl behind her and safe. She could defend a corner-if there weren\u0027t more than two or three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many of them are there?\" she asked the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" The girl was gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How-many-are-there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, and I can\u0027t run anymore!\" The girl staggered to a halt and bent double, hands on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknees, trying to get her breath back. \"My legs... are just like jelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no use, Rashel realized in dismay. She couldn\u0027t expect this bit of blond fluff to out-sprint a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire. But if they stopped here in the open, they were dead. She cast a desperate look around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw it. A Bostonian tradition-an abandoned car. In this city, if you got tired of your car you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust junked it on the nearest embankment. Rashel blessed the unknown benefactor who\u0027d left this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if only they could get in....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way!\" She didn\u0027t wait for the girl to protest, but grabbed her and dragged her. \"Come on, you can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo it! Make it to that car and you don\u0027t have to run anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words seemed to inspire the girl into a last effort. They reached the car and Rashel saw that one of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe back windows was broken out cleanly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was small-boned and went through the window easily. Rashel dove after her. Then she shoved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher down into the leg space in front of the seat and hissed, \"Don\u0027t make a sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay tensely, listening. She barely had time to breathe twice before she heard footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft footsteps, stealthy as a prowling tiger\u0027s. Vampire footsteps. Rashel held her breath and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloser, closer... Rashel could feel the other girl shaking. She watched the dark ceiling of the car and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etried to plan a defense if they were caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps were right outside now. She heard the grate of glass not ten feet from the car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust please don\u0027t let them have a werewolf with them, she thought. Vampires might see and hear better\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethan humans, but a werewolf could sniff its prey out. It couldn\u0027t possibly miss the smell of humans in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the footsteps paused, and Rashel\u0027s heart sank. Eyes open, she silently put her hand on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard the footsteps moving quickly-away. She listened as they faded, keeping utterly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she kept still some more, while she counted to two hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, very carefully, she sat up and looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sight or sound of vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I please get up now?\" came a small whimpering voice from the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you keep quiet,\" Rashel whispered. \"They still may be somewhere nearby. We\u0027re going to have to get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto my car without them catching us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything, as long as I don\u0027t have to run,\" the girl said plaintively, emerging from the floor more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisheveled than ever. \"Have you ever tried to run in four-inch heels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never wear heels,\" Rashel murmured, scanning up and down the street. \"Okay, I\u0027ll get out first, then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou come through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid out the window feet-first. The girl stuck her head through. \"Don\u0027t you ever use doors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh. Come on,\" Rashel whispered. She led the way through the dark streets, moving from shadow to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshadow. At least the girl could walk softly, she thought. And she had a sense of humor even in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel drew a breath of relief when they reached the narrow twisting alley where her Saturn was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparked. They weren\u0027t safe yet, though. She wanted to get the blond girl out of Mission Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you live?\" she said, as she started the engine. When there was no answer, she turned. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirl was staring at her with open uneasiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, how come you\u0027re dressed like that? And who are you, anyway? I mean, I\u0027m glad you saved me-but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t understand anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel hesitated. She needed information from this girl, and that was going to take time-and trust. With\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esudden decision she unwound her scarf, one-handed, until her face was exposed. \"Like I said, I\u0027m a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efriend. But first just tell me: do you know what kind of people had you in that truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl turned away. She was already shivering with cold; now she shivered harder. \"They weren\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople. They were... ugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you do know. Well, I\u0027m one of the people that hunts down that kind of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked from Rashel\u0027s face to the sheathed sword that rested between them. Her jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God! You\u0027re Buffy the Vampire Slayer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Oh.\" Rashel had missed the movie. \"Right. Actually, you can call me Rashel. And you\u0027re... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daphne Childs. And I live in Somerville, but I don\u0027t want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s fine, because I want to talk to you. Let\u0027s find a Dunkin\u0027 Donuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel found one outside of Boston, a safe one she knew had no Night World connections. She pulled a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoat on over her black ninja outfit and lent Daphne a spare sweater from the trunk of her car. Then they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent inside and ordered jelly sticks and hot chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Rashel said. \"Tell me what happened. How did you end up in that truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne cupped her hands around her hot chocolate. \"It was all so horrible...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Rashel tried to make her voice soothing. She hadn\u0027t had much practice at it. \"Try to tell me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanyway. Start at the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, well, it started at the Crypt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, as in \u0027Tales from the...\u0027? Or as in the Old Burial Ground?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As in the club on Prentiss Street. It\u0027s this underground club, and I mean really underground. I mean,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody seems to know about it except the people who go there, and they\u0027re all our age. Sixteen or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseventeen. I never see any adults, not even DJs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\" Rashel was listening intently. The Night People had clubs, usually carefully hidden from humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Daphne have wandered into one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. It\u0027s extremely and seriously cool-or at least that\u0027s what I thought. They have some amazing music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, it\u0027s beyond doom, it\u0027s beyond goth, it\u0027s sort of like void rock. Just listening to it makes you go all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweird and bodiless. And the whole place is decorated like this post-apocalypse wasteland. Or maybe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike the underworld....\" Daphne stared off into the distance. Her eyes, a very deep cornflower blue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunder heavy lashes, looked wistful and almost hypnotized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel poked her and chocolate slopped onto the table. \"Reminisce about it later. What kind of people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere in the club? Vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no.\" Daphne looked shocked. \"Just regular kids. I know some from my school. And there\u0027s lots of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erunaways, I guess. Street kids, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel blinked. \"Runaways...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. They\u0027re mostly very cool, except the ones who do drugs. Those are spooky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn illegal club full of runaway kids, some of whom would probably do anything for drugs. Rashel could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeel her skin tingling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027ve stumbled onto something big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" Daphne was going on, \"I\u0027d been going there for about three weeks, you know, whenever I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould get away from home-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t tell your parents about it,\" Rashel guessed flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you joking? It\u0027s not a place you tell parents about. Anyway, my family doesn\u0027t care where I go. I\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egot four sisters and two brothers and my mom and my step-dad are getting divorced... they don\u0027t even\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enotice when I\u0027m gone.\" \"Go on,\" Rashel said grimly. \"Well, there was this guy.\" Daphne\u0027s cornflower eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked wistful again. \"This guy who was really gorgeous, and really mysterious, and really just-just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifferent from anybody I ever met. And I thought he was maybe interested in me, because I saw him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooking at me once or twice, so I sort of joined the girls who were always hanging around him. We used\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto talk about weird things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, like surrendering yourself to the darkness and stuff. It was like the music, you know-we were all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally into death. Like what would be the most horrible way to die, what would be the most awful torture\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou could live through, what you look like when you\u0027re in your grave. Stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, why?\" Rashel couldn\u0027t disguise her revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" All at once, Daphne looked small and sad. \"I guess because most of us felt life was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epretty rotten. So you kind of face things, you know, to try to get used to them. You probably don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand,\" she added, grimacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel did understand. With a sudden shock, she understood completely. These kids were scared and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edepressed and worried about the future. They had to do something to deaden the pain... even if that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeant embracing pain. They escaped one darkness by going into another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd am I any different? I mean, this obsession I\u0027ve got with vampires... it\u0027s not exactly what you\u0027d call\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enormal and healthy. I spend my whole life dealing with death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, and her voice came out more gentle than when she\u0027d been trying to soothe Daphne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore. Awkwardly, she patted the other girl\u0027s arm once. \"I shouldn\u0027t have yelled. And I do understand,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eactually. Please go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well.\" Daphne still looked defensive. \"Some of the girls would write poetry about dying... and some of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem would prick themselves with pins and lick the blood off. They said they were vampires, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust pretending.\" She glanced warily at Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel simply nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so I talked the same way, and did the same stuff. And this guy Quinn just seemed to love it-hey,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elook out!\" Daphne jerked back to avoid a wave of hot chocolate. Rashel\u0027s sudden movement had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknocked her cup over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, what is wrong with me? Rashel thought. She said, \"Sorry,\" through her teeth, grabbing for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewad of napkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should have been expecting it. She had been expecting it; she knew that Quinn must be involved in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis. But somehow the mention of his name had knocked the props from under her. She hadn\u0027t been able\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto control her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" she said, still through her teeth, \"the gorgeous mysterious guy was named Quinn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Daphne wiped chocolate off her arm. \"And I was starting to think he really liked me. He told me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto come to the club last Sunday and to meet him alone in the parking lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you did.\" Oh, I am going to kill him so dead, Rashel thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I dressed up...\" Daphne looked down at her bedraggled outfit. \"Well, this did look terrific once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I met him and we went to his car. And then he told me that he\u0027d chosen me. I was so happy I almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efainted. I thought he meant for his girlfriend. And then...\" Daphne trailed off again. For the first time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esince she\u0027d begun the story, she looked frightened. \"Then he asked me if I really wanted to surrender to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe darkness. He made it sound so romantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet,\" Rashel said. She rested her head on her hand. She could see it all now, and it was the perfect\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escam. Quinn checked the girls out, discovered which would be missed and which wouldn\u0027t. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekidnapped them from the parking lot so that no one saw them, no one even connected them with the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrypt. Who would notice or care that certain girls stopped showing up? Girls would always be coming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there had been nothing in the newspaper because the daylight world didn\u0027t realize that girls were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeing taken. There probably wasn\u0027t even a struggle during the abduction, because these girls were willing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto go-in the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been a shock,\" Rashel said dryly, \"to find out that there really was a darkness to surrender\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah. Yeah, it was. But I didn\u0027t actually find that out then. I just said, sure, I wanted to. I mean, I\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave said the same thing if he asked me did I really want to watch Lawrence Welk reruns with him. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas that gorgeous. And he was looking at me in this totally soulful way, and I thought he was going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekiss me. And then... I fell asleep.\" Daphne frowned at her paper cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I know it sounds crazy, but I fell asleep and when I woke up I was in this place, this little office in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis warehouse. And I was on this iron cot with this pathetic lumpy mattress, and I was chained down. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad chains on my ankles, just like people in jail. And Quinn was gone, and there were two other girls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echained to other cots.\" Without warning, Daphne began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel handed her a napkin, feeling uncomfortable. \"Were the girls from the Crypt, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne sniffed. \"I don\u0027t know. They might have been. But they wouldn\u0027t talk to me. They were, like, in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrance. They just lay there and stared at the ceiling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you weren\u0027t in a trance,\" Rashel said thoughtfully. \"Somehow you woke up from the mind control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must be resistant like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know anything about mind control. But I was so scared I pretended to be like the other girls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen this guy came to bring us food and take us to the bathroom. I just stared straight ahead like them. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought maybe that way I would get a chance to escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart girl,\" Rashel said. \"And the guy-was it Quinn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I never saw Quinn again. It was this blond guy named Ivan from the club; I called him Ivan the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrible. And there was a girl who brought us food sometimes-I don\u0027t know her name, but I used to see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher at the club, too. They were like Quinn; they each had their own little group, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least two others besides Quinn, Rashel thought. Probably more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t hurt us or anything, and the office was heated, and the food was okay-but I was so scared,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne said. \"I didn\u0027t understand what was going on at all. I didn\u0027t know where Quinn was, or how I\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egotten there, or what they were going to do with us.\" She swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel didn\u0027t understand that last either. What were the vampires doing with the girls in the warehouse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously not killing them out of hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then last night...\" Daphne\u0027s voice wobbled and she stopped to breathe. \"Last night Ivan brought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis new girl in. He carried her in and put her on a cot. And... and... then he bit her. He bit her on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneck. But it wasn\u0027t a game.\" The cornflower-blue eyes stared into the distance, wide with remembered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehorror. \"He really bit her. And blood came out and he drank it. And when he lifted his head up I saw his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eteeth.\" She started to hyperventilate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. You\u0027re safe now,\" Rashel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know! I didn\u0027t know those things were real! I thought it was all just...\" Daphne shook her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehead. \"I didn\u0027t know,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I know it\u0027s a big shock. But you\u0027ve been dealing with it really well. You managed to get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway from the truck, didn\u0027t you? Tell me about the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-that was tonight. I could tell day from night by looking at this little window high up. Ivan and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirl came and took the chains off us and made us all get in the truck. And then I was really scared-I didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow where they were taking us, but I heard something about a boat. And I knew wherever it was, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re right about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne took another breath. \"So I watched the way Ivan shut the door of the truck. He was in back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith us. And when he was looking the other way, I sort of jumped at the door and got it open. And then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just fell out. And then I ran-I didn\u0027t know which way to go, but I knew I had to get away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I saw you. And... I guess you saved my life.\" She considered. \"Uh, I don\u0027t know if I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembered to say thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel made a gesture of dismissal. \"No problem. You saved yourself, really.\" She frowned, staring at a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrop of chocolate on the plastic table without seeing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. I am grateful. Whatever they were going to do to me, I think it must have been pretty awful.\" A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epause, then she said, \"Uh, Rashel? Do you know what they were going to do to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm? Oh.\" Rashel nodded slowly, looking up from the table. \"Yes, I think so.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-7.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
