Alcántara’s kiss was different from Carden’s because Carden could kiss. He’d been my first, so I hadn’t realized it before. But now, kissing Alcántara, I knew. Carden…just…wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew better than to spurn the affections of a vampire, particularly one whose fangs were right there, and so tried to sense what Alcántara wanted me to do. Technically, his kiss was fine, but something about it was coldly precise. Passionless compared to Carden’s all-consuming touch. His lips were cool, and as much as I tried to follow his lead, I felt how my movements were just as stiff and studied in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away. Compared to my kiss with Carden, the contact had been brief. With Carden, I’d fallen into the kiss, into him, from the instant my lips had touched his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thank you for the small intimacy, mijita. It was most illuminating.” Alcántara gave me a tiny half bow. “I will bid you good night,” he said, his voice chilly and polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe keening in my mind hitched up a notch, but this time my panic was for an entirely different reason. Had I been too reluctant? Or worse, had he sensed Carden? Detected our bond?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t know, because the Spanish vampire swept me aside and was out the door before I could shut my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night, I’d been lucky. Lucky the Guidons hadn’t eaten Mei-Ling for a midnight snack. Lucky that Alcántara hadn’t torn me limb from limb when he sensed whatever it was he’d sensed in my kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d left, and Mei-Ling had been sitting on the floor outside the door, curled into herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mei.” I was still shaky and weirded out from Alcántara’s kiss, and it took me a moment to register that she was there and relatively unscathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at me. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? How about you?” A welt was rising on her cheekbone, and it made my blood boil. I recognized Masha’s whip in that mark. Anger focused me, wiping away the remnants of Alcántara’s surreal and creepy touches. “What did they do to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no big deal.” She stood and brushed herself off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that it was, in fact, a big deal. But I knew Mei, which meant I knew not to press the issue. Instead, I asked, “What are you doing out here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They told me not to go in.” She glanced at the door as though a dozen vampires might spring out. “You know, while he was in there with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down the hall, the lights dimmed for curfew. “You could at least have waited in the lounge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “I wanted to be close…just in case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In case…” I’d thought I knew Mei-Ling, but apparently I still had much to learn. “In case I needed help?” My shoulders slumped, I was so completely touched by the sentiment. Though if Alcántara decided he wanted me dead, how anyone could help was beyond me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” She gave me a flicker of a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scanned her, standing there in her gray Acari uniform tunic and leggings. “Do you even have your flute?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered the situation. Mei-Ling had been kidnapped here against her will. I was bonded to a vampire who was going to be staked because another vampire decided he stood in the way of a goal. Oh, and apparently, I was the icing-on-the-cake part of that goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was embroiled in a game that was far more complicated than the girl gladiator torture they’d subjected us to in the first semester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shooed her into our room, shutting the door behind us. There was work to do, and I didn’t waste any time. “Okay, lesson one. Always have that flute. We’ll make a special holster or something. You need a way to tuck it in your pants without anyone seeing. It won’t break, will it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said, sitting on the edge of her bed, not taking her eyes from me. Her attention was avid, but not in a slavering, I’ll-do-whatever-you-tell-me sort of way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appreciated the trust. It made me want to help her all the more. “That’s good,” I told her. “You’ll have enough to occupy you with lesson two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s lesson two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m making you a better weapon than just a damned flute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised a brow, giving me a sassy look. “I think it’s more than just a damned flute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d sounded amused, but when I replied, I was more serious than ever. “Yeah, but can it pierce a heart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked appalled. “I can’t pierce someone’s heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no patience for her revulsion. “First of all, it wouldn’t be someone’s heart. It’d be something’s. And, if it were your life or theirs, you bet you could do it. But first, you need a stake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been thinking about this since the day Ronan had revealed his handmade stakes, slim but lethal, hidden beneath the sleeves of his sweater. One of those stakes had saved my life, killing the Draug that would’ve killed me. And now I was going to make some for myself. For us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where will you get a stake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood at my bureau, sad but resolved. Because the trouble was, you needed wood to carve a stake. And the only wood I had was my shuriken box. “Stakes—plural. I’m gonna make them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re making us stakes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the drawer. Pulled it out. I hated to do it. I’d not received many gifts in my life, and this had been one of them. Even though it came from a bunch of vampires, it was impossible not to appreciate the gorgeous antique, stained a deep red. The wood had been notched and pieced together by hand. Someone had spent much time carving a crane, etched in black on the lid. “Yup. Hopefully I can get a few out of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you can’t,” she exclaimed, seeing the box. “That’s too beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then they’ll be some mighty pretty stakes.” I set aside the throwing stars, wrapped in a swatch of dark velvet. I’d tucked my pencil rubbing of the runes in there, too, and pulled it out, sliding it under my clothes instead. It was a weird compulsion, keeping this memento, but somehow the snippet of ancient Viking graffiti served as a reminder of how banal humanity actually was. How banal it was supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held up the empty box, studied it. And then in a violent motion, I began to wriggle the lid free of the base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei leapt to her feet. “You’ll ruin it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung my back to her, holding it out of her reach. “Better the box than us.” The hinges slowly gave way, and then my arms jerked as the lid ripped free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to work, popping off the edges of the top and the sides. I’d use it all. “Hopefully, we’ll each get two good stakes out of this. Maybe three. They’ll be crude, but sharp enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to sharpen the chunks of wood, using the edge of one of my throwing stars. It reminded me of peeling potatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat next to me, enthralled. “What are we going to do with them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not going to do anything. You’re going to learn how to protect yourself, so you can keep yourself safe if anything happens to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going to happen to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep in thought, I swept the edge of my shuriken along the stake, working methodically. Lethal points were gradually emerging from the blunted, splintered ends. “The vampires in charge want Car—Master McCloud dead, even though I’m certain he’s innocent. There’s more going on with this island than Watcher training.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you think if you throw Master Alcántara off stride, you’ll get one step closer to uncovering the truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped carving, amazed. “Wow, you really are going all Nancy Drew on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I prefer Buffy references.” She gave me a sly grin. “And I want to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIronically, it was the grin that turned my stomach, stopping me. My hands froze in midair. She should’ve been grinning with friends at the mall, not smiling with me over this macabre endeavor. “I can’t let you help me. I mean, you could die, Mei.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grew serious. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why help? And why me? I mean, we just met. Seriously, I’m just a messed-up seventeen-year-old who’s trying to go down swinging. I am so not worthy of your help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away, thinking, and I expected an adolescent response. But what I got was something far wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My grandmother used to tell me not to be afraid,” she said. “She said the only thing in this world that we should fear is standing still.” She met my eyes once more, her expression hard and focused. “The vampires ordered the Tracer to kill my boyfriend. They would’ve killed my family if I hadn’t come. I must not remain still. Evil has been done to me. I can lie down and take it. Or I can stand up and take revenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the crude stakes in my lap. “But this could get you killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can take action, help you figure out what’s going on in this crazy place, and maybe get killed instantly. Or I can sit here, doing what I’m told, waiting to get killed eventually.” She gave me a wry look. “I prefer just ripping off the Band-Aid, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind went back to my creepy run-in with Alcántara. Something had shifted in his lizardy eyes, telling me he might’ve been done with Mei-Ling. It gave me a chill, but I thought her assessment was probably right. From now on, she would simply be waiting for her eventual death. And it wouldn’t be a long wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a quiet smile, then looked down to continue my carving. “Okay, here’s what we’re going to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to explain the situation, but my roommate interrupted me almost immediately, and I guess I understood why. The phrase “There’s a Draug keeper I need to spy on” wasn’t something you heard every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her one of my stars to help with the carving, and as we worked, I told her about Draugs and about the keeper and about the dire warnings I’d heard about the other side of the island. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-fever-the-watchers-3/page-30.html","bookId":2293,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM"}
