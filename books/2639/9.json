Beck had been dead so long now no one knew exactly why his name was still on the door. Had a nice ring to it-Wiley Beck-and, too, it would be expensive to change the stationery and such. For an accounting firm that had been around for half a century, the amazing thing was how little it had grown. There were a dozen partners in tax, including Luther, and twenty or so in auditing. Their clients were mid-range companies that couldn\u0027t afford the national accounting firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Stanley Wiley\u0027d had more ambition, some thirty years earlier, the old firm might possibly have caught the wave and become a force. But he hadn\u0027t, and it didn\u0027t, and now it pretended to be content by calling itself a \"boutique firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Luther was planning another quick departure for another sprint to the mall, Stanley materialized from nowhere with a long sandwich, lettuce hanging off the sides. \"Got a minute?\" he said with a mouthful. He was already sitting before Luther could say yes or no or can it be quick? He wore silly bow ties and usually had a variety of stains on his blue button-downs-ink, mayonnaise, coffee. Stanley was a slob, his office a notorious landfill where documents and files were lost for months. \"Try Stanley\u0027s office\" was the firm\u0027s slogan for paperwork that would never be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you\u0027re not going to be at the Christmas dinner tomorrow night,\" he said, still chewing. Stanley liked to roam the halls at lunch with a sandwich in one hand, a soda in the other, as if he were too busy for a real lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m eliminating a lot of things this year, Stanley, no offense to anyone,\" Luther said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. We will not be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley swallowed with a frown, then examined the sandwich in search of the next bite. He was the managing partner, not the boss. Luther\u0027d been a partner for six years. No one at Wiley Beck could force him to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to hear that. Jayne will be disappointed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drop her a note,\" Luther said. It wasn\u0027t a terrible evening-a nice dinner at an old restaurant downtown, in a private room upstairs, good food, decent wines, a few speeches, then a band and dancing until late. Black tie, of course, and the ladies tried hard to one-up each other with dresses and jewelry. Jayne Wiley was a delightful woman who deserved a lot more than she got with Stanley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any particular reason?\" Stanley asked, prying just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re skipping the whole production this year, Stanley, no tree, no gifts, no hassle. Saving the money and taking a cruise for ten days. Blair\u0027s gone, we need a break. I figure we\u0027ll catch up rather nicely next year, or if not, the year after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does come every year, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you\u0027re losing weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten pounds. The beaches are waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look great, Luther. Tanning, I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying a darker shade, yes. I can\u0027t let the sun get the best of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge bite of the ham-on-baguette, with strands of lettuce trailing along and hanging between the lips. Then movement: \"Not a bad idea, really.\" Or something like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley\u0027s idea of a vacation was a week in his beach house, a hand-me-down in which he had invested nothing in thirty years. Luther and Nora had spent one dreadful week there, guests of the Wileys, who took the main bedroom and put the Kranks in the \"guest suite,\" a narrow room with bunk beds and no air conditioning. Stanley\u0027d knocked back gin and tonics from midmorning until late afternoon and the sun never touched his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left, his cheeks full, but before Luther could escape, Yank Slader darted in. \"Up to fifty-two hundred bucks, old boy,\" he announced. \"With no end in sight. Abigail just spent six hundred bucks on a dress for the Christmas dinner, don\u0027t know why she couldn\u0027t wear the one from last year or the year before, but why argue? Shoes were a buck-forty. Purse another ninety. Closets\u0027re full of purses and shoes, but don\u0027t get me started. We\u0027ll top seven grand at this rate. Please let me go on the cruise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspired by Luther, Yank was keeping a precise tally on the Christmas damage. Twice a week he dashed in for updates. What he would do with the results was uncertain. Most likely nothing, and he knew it. \"You\u0027re my hero,\" he said again, and left as quickly as he\u0027d arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re all envious, Luther thought to himself. At this moment, crunch time with only a week to go, and the holiday madness growing each day, they\u0027re all jealous as hell. Some, like Stanley, were reluctant to admit it. Others, like Yank, were downright proud of Luther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late to tan. Luther walked to his window and enjoyed the view of a cold rain falling on the city. Gray skies, barren trees, a few leaves scattering with the wind, traffic backed up on the streets in the distance. How lovely, he thought smugly. He patted his flat stomach, then went downstairs and had a diet soda with Biff, the travel agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the buzzer, Nora bolted from the BronzeMat and grabbed a towel. Sweating was not something she particularly enjoyed, and she wiped herself with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a very small red bikini, one that had looked great on the young slinky model in the catalog, one she knew she\u0027d never wear in public but Luther had insisted on anyway. He\u0027d gawked at the model and threatened to order the thing himself. It wasn\u0027t too expensive, so Nora now owned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced in the mirror and again blushed at the sight of herself in such a skimpy garment. Sure she was losing weight. Sure she was getting a tan. But it would take five years of starvation and hard labor in the gym to do justice to what she was wearing at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dressed quickly, pulling her slacks and sweater on over the bikini. Luther swore he tanned in the nude, but she wasn\u0027t stripping for anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven dressed, she still felt like a slut. The thing was tight in all the wrong places, and when she walked, well, it wasn\u0027t exactly comfortable. She couldn\u0027t wait to race home, take it off, throw it away, and enjoy a long hot bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d made it safely out of Tans Forever and rounded a corner when she came face to face with the Reverend Doug Zabriskie, their minister. He was laden with shopping bags, while she held nothing but her overcoat. He was pale, she was red-faced and still sweating. He was comfortable in his old tweed jacket, overcoat, collar, black shirt. Nora\u0027s bikini was cutting off her circulation and shrinking by the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hugged politely. \"Missed you last Sunday,\" he said, the same irritating habit he\u0027d picked up years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re so busy,\" she said, checking her forehead for sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay, Nora?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look a little winded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of walking,\" she said, lying to her minister. For some reason he glanced down at her shoes. She certainly wasn\u0027t wearing sneakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could we chat for a moment?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure,\" she said. There was an empty bench near the railing of the concourse. The Reverend lugged his bags over and piled them beside it. When Nora sat, Luther\u0027s little red bikini shifted again and something gave way, a strap perhaps, just above her hip, and something was sliding down there. Her slacks were loose, not tight at all, and there was plenty of room for movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard lots of rumors,\" he began softly. He had the annoying habit of getting close to your face when he spoke. Nora crossed and recrossed her legs, and with each maneuver made things worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of rumors?\" she asked stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll be very honest, Nora,\" he said, leaning even lower and closer. \"I hear it from a good source that you and Luther have decided not to observe Christmas this year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of this,\" he said gravely, as if the Kranks had discovered a new variety of sin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was suddenly afraid to move, and even then got the impression that she was still falling out of her clothes. Fresh beads of sweat popped up along her forehead. \"Are you okay, Nora?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine and we\u0027re fine. We still believe in Christmas, in celebrating the birth of Christ, we\u0027re just passing on all the foolishness this year. Blair\u0027s gone and we\u0027re taking a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pondered this long and hard, while she shifted slightly. \"It is a bit crazy, isn\u0027t it?\" he said, looking at the pile of shopping bags he had deposited nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes it is. Look, we\u0027re fine, Doug, I promise. We\u0027re happy and healthy and just relaxing a bit. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, for ten days on a cruise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked his beard as though he wasn\u0027t sure if he approved of this or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t miss the midnight service, will you?\" he asked with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No promises, Doug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted her knee and said good-bye. She waited until he was out of sight, and then finally mustered the courage to get to her feet. She shuffled out of the mall, cursing Luther and his bikini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic Frohmeyer\u0027s wife\u0027s cousin\u0027s youngest daughter was active in her Catholic church, which had a large youth choir that enjoyed caroling around the city. Couple of phone calls, and the gig was booked. A light snow was falling when the concert began. The choir formed a half-moon in the driveway, near the gas lamp, and on cue started bawling \"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\" They waved at Luther when he peeked through the blinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crowd soon gathered behind the carolers, kids from the neighborhood, the Beckers From next door, the Trogdon clan. There by virtue of an anonymous tip, a reporter for the Gazette watched for a few minutes, then asserted himself and rang the Kranks\u0027 doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther yanked the door open, ready to land a punch. \"What is it?\" \"White Christmas\" resounded in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Mr. Krank?\" asked the reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian Brown with the Gazette. Can I ask you some questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About this skipping Christmas business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther gazed at the crowd in his driveway. One of those dark silhouettes out there had squealed on him. One of his neighbors had called the newspaper. Either Frohmeyer or Walt Scheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not talking,\" he said and slammed the door. Nora was in the shower, again, and Luther went to the basement. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skipping-christmas/page-9.html","bookId":2639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM"}
