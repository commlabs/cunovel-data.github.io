This was something that caused Nalan Yanran to feel shocked. Only at this moment did she completely believe that Yun Shan had truly been defeated by Xiao Yan’s hands. On top of being shocked, she also felt somewhat dejected. Originally, she had thought that after passing the test of the ‘Gate of Life and Death’, the great increase in her strength would definitely be able to surpass Xiao Yan. However, reality gave her a cruel answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer neck was extended in a graceful arc. However, it did not dare to move even a little under his slightly trembling hand. Currently, Xiao Yan was not in a calm state. Should he really furiously unleashed his strength, it was likely that this female soul would become another icy corpse on this open ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan! Don’t hurt Yanran!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe split second exchange had also caught Yun Yun a little off guard. By the time she had recovered, she saw that Xiao Yan had actually restrained Nalan Yanran. Her heart immediately rose as she cried out involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mister Xiao Yan, please show mercy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNalan Jie and Nalan Su in the sky had also been shocked to the point where cold sweat flowed profusely. Their two bodies moved and hurriedly rushed down before pleading with an anxious voice. Currently, Nalan Yanran had already reached the strength of the peak of the Dou Wang class. In this way, it would led to a great increase in the strength of the Nalan clan. They would truly end up vomitting blood if she was this easily killed by Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHai Bodong and the others watched this scene. They exchanged looks with one another but did not open their mouths to say anything. Currently, the Misty Cloud Sect had already been greatly crippled. Not only was Yun Shan dead but over half of the Elders were also dead. Although the sect still had Yun Yun, an elite Dou Huang with quite a great reputation, it was likely that it would have difficulty causing much trouble in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan ignored everyone’s voice as his hand trembled slightly. His hand held Nalan Yanran’s neck tightly and a struggle flashed across the deep parts of his eyes. He was not a truly callous person. No matter how one put it, he and Yun Yun still possessed an intricate and complicated feeling. Nalan Yanran in front of him had also nearly become the woman who would accompany him for a lifetime. He did not have much feeling for the latter but toward Yun Yun…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden heaven-shaking cry was transmitted from the bottom of the mountain peak just as the glow flickered across Xiao Yan’s eyes. Immediately, a countless number of armored human figures came swarming up like ants before surrounding the entire sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden arrival of the army had caused the Misty Cloud Sect disciples in the open ground to become chaotic. Their faces became slightly white as they sensed the killing intent that soared to the sky. Did these people really intent to kill every single person within the Misty Cloud Sect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human flow that came from all directions charged into the Misty Cloud Sect like floodwaters. They swiftly arrived at a spot near the open ground and completely surrounded everyone present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flow of the soldiers slowly ceased and the human flow split apart at the middle. Princess Yao Ye’s figure slowly appeared in everyone’s sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Ye, who had revealed herself, had a stunned gaze as she looked at the open ground which was already in a complete mess. Finally, it paused at the black-robed, young man. She was just about to say something when a human figure rushed down from the sky and appeared in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great-grandfather, the defenses of the Misty Cloud Sect have been completely destroyed. As long as the order is given…” Yao Ye hurriedly stepped forward when she saw the person who had arrived. She smiled slightly but the words that were being spat out from her red lips were quite bloody and indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no need to rush. Let’s see Xiao Yan’s intentions…” Jia Xing Tian waved his hand and turned his gaze toward Xiao Yan in the sky. The fate of the Misty Cloud Sect was completely held in his hand. As long as he give the word, blood would really flow like a river in the Misty Cloud Sect today. All the Misty Cloud Sect’s disciples would become dead souls in the face of a blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Ye obediently nodded when she heard this. Although she was royalty and she controlled the life of the entire empire, she was not an ordinary woman. She naturally knew who the person was who could call the shots around here. The fate of the Misty Cloud Sect was currently already determined. In which case, this ferocious tiger which had dominated the Jia Ma Empire for so many years had completely collapse. However, another young ferocious tiger had emerged. Moreover, he had an even more frightening strength and potential than the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary, their imperial family might have borrowed Xiao Yan’s strength to destroy the Misty Cloud Sect which they feared the most. However, not long later, a new ‘Misty Cloud Sect’ would appear. This was because Xiao Yan’s current strength had already given him this kind of qualification!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan glanced at the soldiers who had charged up the mountain top. He immediately looked at Yun Yun’s pale-white pretty face by the side and his hand slowly released Nalan Yanran’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“*Cough*! *Cough*!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sleek redness surged onto Nalan Yanran’s white face after she escaped from Xiao Yan’s clamp. She let out a couple of intense coughs before hurriedly moving behind Yun Yun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun gently waved her hand and interrupted Nalan Yanran’s words. She lowered her head and glanced at the army that was filled with a killing aura. Finally, she slowly sighed and asked in a hoarse voice, “Are you really only going to be satisfied if you kill everyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is going to pay the blood feud of my Xiao clan?” An unknown emotion surged into Xiao Yan’s heart as he looked at Yun Yun’s pale sheet-white face. He immediately turned his head, hardened his heart and coldly spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun smiled in a tragic manner. She slowly tightened her grip on her longsword. A moment later, she clenched her silver teeth abruptly. “I will repay it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun’s hand moved after she said this. The sharp longsword in her hand ruthlessly pierced toward her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher!” This action of Yun Yun immediately caused a chaos to erupt in the open ground below. Nalan Yanran behind her was pale as she cried out sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longsword cut through the air. However, a hand suddenly appeared just as it was about to pierce Yun Yun’s neck. It immediately grabbed firmly onto the sword’s blade. Fresh blood flowed along the longsword and fell from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun was startled when she saw that the longsword was stopped. She immediately looked at the hand cut by the longsword as blood flowed repeatedly out of it. She hurriedly abandoned the sword and wanted to step forward to help but ended up not daring to move in the front of Xiao Yan’s unusually dark and cold face, feeling momentarily helpless. It was unexpected that Xiao Yan would actually intervene…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you die, all the members of the Misty Cloud Sect will accompany you to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan threw the longsword aside. His face was indifferent as he rubbed his hand on his robe while his voice spoke in a cool manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, what exactly do you want to do? If you think that the Misty Cloud Sect owes you too much, just use my life as compensation as long as you let these ordinary disciples from the Misty Cloud Sect off. They were only obeying orders and don’t know anything!” Yun Yun did not dare to make any unusual movement after hearing this threat from Xiao Yan. She could only clench her silver teeth as she hissed out words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Repay? Repay what? Can your death revive the members of my Xiao clan? Can your death allow my father and my teacher to return? You idiotic woman!” Xiao Yan’s eyes suddenly widened as he roared out furiously. Yun Yun had fought against him repeatedly for the Misty Cloud Sect. This caused his fury to assault his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire open ground was completely silent. Only Xiao Yan’s screams reverberated through the sky. Everyone knew that the fate of the Misty Cloud Sect was currently held in the hands of this young man whose emotions were currently extremely unstable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun eyes did not dare to meet Xiao Yan’s after seeing the latter’s furious expression. It must be said that the person in front of her was no longer that somewhat tender young man after not having met him for three years. The current him already completely possessed the disposition and greatness of a strong person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not using my life to threaten you to let off the Misty Cloud Sect. I know that I might not possess such a right now… however, as the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect, there is no longer a need for me to remain in this world if everyone in the Misty Cloud Sect is really killed by you. After which, I can only commit suicide in order to apologize to all the ancestors.” Yun Yun laughed bitterly and slowly spoke as a glow passed through her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan tightened his fist. His eyes were flashing in a volatile manner. Everyone could tell that he was struggling in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHai Bodong and the others in the sky all wisely chose not to interrupt when they saw this scene. They had long been aware that Xiao Yan possessed a deep relationship with Yun Yun. It seemed that there was really something from watching their current conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedusa by the side remained suspended in mid-air. Her gaze was indifferent as she looked at the couple of people below who were entangled with each other. A somewhat irritated emotion rose within her heart when she heard the conversation between Xiao Yan and Yun Yun that was filled with hidden meaning. This kind of irritated emotion caused her to pull the little Zi Yan over while the latter was eagerly watching the scene below. After which, she randomly rubbed against her little head, causing the latter to adopt a bitter face while she grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, everything was started because of me back then. As long as you are willing to let the Misty Cloud Sect and teacher off, I, Nalan Yanran… will be willing even if I have to end up as a slave or a servant!” Nalan Yanran by the side suddenly clenched her teeth and spoke when she saw the rapidly changing face of Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNalan Jie and Nalan Su were startled when they heard Nalan Yanran’s words. They exchanged looks with one another but did not open their mouths to speak. With Xiao Yan’s current ability and faction, he would definitely become another ‘Misty Cloud Sect’ in the future. There was naturally no need to mention the benefit toward the Nalan clan if Nalan Yanran could once again have some relation to him. It was fine even if this kind of relationship was that of a servant or slave. They were still quite confident about Nalan Yanran’s appearance. Although she had quite a bit a of grudge with Xiao Yan in the past, things would naturally change once they were together for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I had such an interest, our relationship would have been different three years ago...” Xiao Yan indifferently glanced at Nalan Yanran and coldly said, “You want to use yourself to exchange for the lives of so many people in the Misty Cloud Sect? On what grounds do you deserve it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNalan Yanran tightly bit her lower red lip. Although she was displeased in her heart, she did not dare to act presumptuous toward this young man, who controlled the lives of the Misty Cloud Sect in his hands. Currently, the status of the two parties were no longer what they were three years ago…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should stop playing around with this teacher and disciple. Just tell us what you want. With things having developed until this extent, the Misty Cloud Sect no longer has any strength to retaliate…” Yun Yun sighed somewhat tiredly. She ceased hiding her bright eyes and looked at Xiao Yan. Her voice was hoarse as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan knit his brows slightly. He started intently at Yun Yun in front of him. However, Yun Yun did not hide under the fierce gaze this time around. Her bright eyes were filled with fatigue and helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth moved and his expression was dark. His gaze swept over the large open ground below. A long time later, he suddenly clenched his teeth as his cold voice resounded over the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disband the Misty Cloud Sect within a month. Otherwise, nothing will remain alive!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-724\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-726\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-725","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
