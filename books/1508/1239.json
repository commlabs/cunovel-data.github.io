In truth, Lin Ming was much younger than most of the disciples here, and his merits and qualifications were also low so far. But, because he was so strong, many of them simply called him their senior-apprentice brother; this was the standard of the martial arts sects. The top genius of a Great World King Holy Land was also called a specific name, such as Elder Senior-apprentice Brother or Elder Senior-apprentice Sister.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt had been extremely difficult for the Ancient Phoenix Clan to produce a talent that was able to enter the top 1000 or even potentially top 500 rankings of the First Martial Meeting.
