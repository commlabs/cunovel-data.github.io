{"id":84445,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u003cp\u003eKellan watched me intently, too intently, and I looked away. \"The D-Bags play the campus every once and awhile.\" I looked back and he smiled oddly. \"I actually know it pretty well. I can show you around if you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief washed through me at the idea of having a guide. \"Oh, please, yes.\" Struggling to regain my composure, I added, \"I mean, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe half-smiled adorably at me. \"No, Kiera, I don\u0027t mind...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the oddity in his voice at the tail end of that sentence, I added, \"There is a registration thing tomorrow. Could you take me, and then Sunday we could look around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled broadly again. \"Sounds great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Kellan, rather cheerily, took me to school and walked me to the admissions office, since he seemed to know exactly where it was. I thanked him repeatedly, which he brushed it off with his hand, insisting it was no big deal. I told him that I had no idea how long I\u0027d have to wait for my turn, so I would take the bus back home. He looked at me funny and then smiled and wished me luck before he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited with other nervous-looking students in the waiting area. I stared at my hands, mentally going over what classes I should take, until a woman came up to me and motioned me to an open door leading to the registration office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office was warm and inviting, which actually did relax me a little bit. Two incredibly large bookcases (crammed full of thick, hardbound books), multiple file cabinets and a large, clean desk in front of the window overlooking the quad, were all in a deep, dark cherry color that coordinated with the beige walls perfectly. Plants were everywhere around the room. The person who occupied this office must have a green thumb; I couldn\u0027t keep anything alive for more than three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat woman was currently sitting at the desk, and looked up at me as her college-aged assistant motioned me through the open door. The woman was very professional looking, and I suddenly felt very dowdy and uncomfortable. I had an odd desire for Kellan to still be here. I knew that he would be completely comfortable walking up to this woman, giving her a sly half-smile and getting whatever he wanted from her, since she would be putty in his hands. A twinge of jealousy passed through me. Life must be so much easier, when you know that you\u0027re absurdly attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed internally and straightened myself as I approached her. I may not be anything special to look at, but I was smart, and in a place such as this, that counted more. I held out my hand, trying to picture what Denny would do in this situation. \"Hello. I\u0027m Kiera Allen. I\u0027m transferring in this year and need to register.\" I smiled, thinking that came out okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and took my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Kiera, welcome to U-Dub. What can I help you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and sat down. That went much better than I thought it would. We sat and talked about what I had already taken at Ohio U, and what I would still need to graduate. We debated my schedule and went over the still open classes, finding a few that fit together perfectly. I only needed three this semester, which worked out great, leaving me time to study...and quite frankly sleep, since I was working so late most nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the meeting, I had my three classes lined up. European Lit, with all the great classics: the Bronte sisters, Austen, Dickens. I was really looking forward to that class. Microeconomics, which Denny had suggested I take, insisting that he could help me study. I\u0027d told him that I could handle it, but he had been so excited to teach me. And lastly, Psychology. I had really wanted a psych class, but the only open one that fit into my schedule was Human Sexuality. Blushing deeply, I signed up for it. I could take a seat in the very back of the room and not say a word. Besides, when Denny got home, he could help me study for that one too...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I left the admissions office, quite a bit later, I blinked in surprise at seeing Kellan leaning against the wall across from the door, one foot propped up, and an espresso in each hand. Upon seeing me, he lifted one up and raised an eyebrow. I couldn\u0027t help the huge smile as I walked over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked, gleefully taking the coffee he offered me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thought you might want a ride home...and a pick me up.\" He lifted his own coffee and took a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only stare at him, dumbfounded for a second, before I finally gave him a kiss on the cheek. \"Thank you, Kellan...for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down and, smiling, shook his head. \"Come on,\" he said softly. \"Let\u0027s go home. You can tell me all about your classes.\" He looked back at me and grinned. Thinking of my psych class, I blushed deeply again and he chuckled adorably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Sunday, Kellan took me for a tour around the campus. There were a surprising amount of people walking around, either getting ready to reenter the school, or, like me, checking it out for the first time. The campus was massive, more like a small city. Of course, the first place Kellan showed me was a small bar across the way from the University bookstore. Smiling at him, and shaking my head a little, we went inside for a quick lunch and a beer before our little adventure. Next, we went to the bookstore, where I found all the books I would need. I got most of them used, which saved me a bundle - books are dang expensive. I had to smile at Kellan while I was in line; he was flipping through a thick one on Human Anatomy, while talking to two giggling, college-age girls nearby... always the flirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we crossed the street to enter the campus. It was breathtakingly beautiful. Expertly landscaped and maintained lawns had crisscrossing paths that led to several imposing brick buildings. Dormant cherry blossoms were everywhere in the quad; the campus would be truly stunning in the spring. People of various ages and ethnicities were lounging around the grass, enjoying the sunny day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling at me, Kellan led me past the stately buildings, knowing the name of each one and what was taught there. Gowen Hall - Asian literature and political science. Smith Hall - history and geography. Savery Hall - philosophy, sociology and economics (where my micro-economics class would be). Miller Hall - the admin hall, which was the only place on campus I\u0027d been. Raitt Hall - speech communications and nutritional sciences...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on and on with the detailed explanations of what and where everything was. I had brochures, but he barely looked at them. He just seemed to know most everything by heart. He was the best guide I could have asked for, and I found myself more and more appreciative of him, and his kind offer. And not entirely for the fact that he seemed to know every nook and cranny of the campus, which seemed really odd to me, since he\u0027d made it sound like he\u0027d only visited a of couple times for some shows (I was beginning to have some suspicions about the true source of his knowledge).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, mostly I was grateful for the fact that walking beside him down the paths and the halls of the school, caused me to be practically invisible. He drew almost every eye to him like a flame. Women openly stared (even a few men did too) while the rest of the guys watched the women with puzzled looks on their faces, like they didn\u0027t get it. Either way was fine with me, as long as he was the one being looked at. Since Denny\u0027s departure, I\u0027d been feeling really lonely, and more than a little depressed. We were walking through swarms of people I didn\u0027t know, that I didn\u0027t feel like getting to know today, and I was more than happy to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellan was pleasant company and chatted politely with me. He made eye contact with several of the girls in the hall, and surprisingly, avoided eye contact with others (I had suspicions about that too). We walked through a lot of the campus and through some of the various buildings and hallways. He made sure to go through the buildings where my classes were and pointed out which rooms were mine and what routes would be the best to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe afternoon had been pretty uneventful, aside from the stares he drew, when suddenly we came across someone that surprised us both. We were walking down the hallway to where my European Lit class would be, when from behind us we heard -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! My! God! Kellan Kyle!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked behind him instinctually to his name being called. He looked puzzled, as a petite redhead with springy hair and a face full of freckles, bounded down the hall towards us. Panic crossed his features and I thought for a second he might try and run for it. Before he could do anything though, the tiny girl had flung her arms around his neck and was kissing him voraciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked in shock and sudden discomfort. Taking a break from his lips, she sighed ecstatically. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re visiting me at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellan blinked, his mouth open in surprise, but remained quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl glanced over at me and frowned. \"Oh, I can see you\u0027re busy.\" She reached in her small purse for a piece of paper and a pen, scribbled something on it, and shoved it, rather seductively, in Kellan\u0027s front pocket. He fidgeted slightly, an odd look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me,\" she breathed, kissing him passionately again before taking off, back down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started walking again, like nothing even remotely weird had just happened, and I hurried to catch up with him. I couldn\u0027t help but stare at him in disbelief. He was sort of acting like being mauled was commonplace. Eventually, he turned to look over at me. \"Who was that?\" I asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrunched his face adorably, in confusion and concentration. \"I really have no idea.\" He reached in his pocket and took out the note. \"Hmmm...that was, Candy.\" His eyes snapped up as recognition flared. He grinned and looked back to where she had disappeared. I rolled my eyes, suddenly and surprisingly, a little irritated. My earlier suspicions were pretty much confirmed at that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe surprised me by crumpling the note and tossing it into a wastebasket we walked by. I wondered about that, my irritation cooling. I\u0027d kind of figured...Candy, had been about to get a phone call later. I couldn\u0027t hold back the smile. Poor girl. And she had been so excited too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week later, on a bright and cheery Sunday morning, I was aimlessly flipping through channels on the television. I wasn\u0027t really watching anything, too lost in thought. Denny hadn\u0027t called again last night. It was starting to become a more frequent thing, and I was really starting to lose patience. I tried to remind myself over and over that he would be home in a few weeks, that this purgatory would eventually end. But nothing was lifting my mood, not today. Today I was wallowing in pity. That was my plan anyway. I was on my thousandth sigh when Kellan abruptly appeared in the living room and stepped between me and the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\" He held his hand out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him, confused. \"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not spending, yet another day, moping on the couch.\" He smiled. \"You\u0027re coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot moving, and frowning at his cheeriness, I sullenly asked, \"And where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled his charming half-smile. \"Bumbershoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bumper-what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed a little and smiled wider. \"Bumbershoot. Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea what that was and I smiled mockingly. \"But that will ruin a perfectly good day of wallowing. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\" He beamed at me and his sudden handsomeness caught my breath. Hmmm, this could be interesting... \"Fine,\" I sighed, and ignoring his still outstretched hand, I stood myself up and, overly exaggerating my irritation, headed upstairs to change, while he laughed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed warmly and casually in shorts and a t-shirt, so I copied him and picked out my shorty-shorts and a tight tank top. He watched me as I came down the stairs, and then looked away, smiling to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" he asked, grabbing his keys and wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" I still had no idea what I\u0027d just gotten myself into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, Kellan drove us to Pete\u0027s. \"Bumbershoot is at Pete\u0027s?\" I asked mockingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellan smiled at me and rolled his eyes. \"No, the guys are at Pete\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart unexpectedly dropped a little. \"Oh, they\u0027re coming too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the car in park and frowned at me, noticing my disappointment. \"Yeah...is that okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWondering why that had bothered me, I shook my head. \"No, of course that\u0027s fine. I\u0027m intruding on your day anyway.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-13.html","bookId":1887,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:26 PM"}
