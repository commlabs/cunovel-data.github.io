{"id":86595,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"More than you realize, Caleb. You gonna make an appearance at Brian\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.\" It\u0027s shitty enough I have to be gawked at by a bunch of adults. \"Why? You going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah raises her eyebrows and looks right at me. I get it. She\u0027s not going either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should probably keep an eye on Mom,\" Leah says, biting on one of her black-painted nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she just picked up a microphone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, a loud, buzzing sound comes from the porch, then our mom\u0027s voice bellows through the yard. \"Thank you all for coming,\" she announces with a flair that would make the Queen of England proud. \"And for welcoming my son Caleb back with open arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen arms? My own mother won\u0027t lay a hand on me unless it\u0027s in a public forum. I can\u0027t stomach another word. More than I dread that upcoming meeting with my transition counselor, I dread getting up and speaking into that microphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause what I\u0027m itching to say won\u0027t be fake or phony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI duck out the side gate. As I head down to Paradise Park, I untuck the geeky shirt from my too-tight trousers and unbutton each button until the entire shirt is open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the first time I\u0027ve felt any freedom since I\u0027ve been home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can go where I want and unbutton my shirt as much as I want. I don\u0027t have anybody watching me or looking at me or talking to me or gawking at me. How I wish I could rewind the past year and start over. Life doesn\u0027t let you do that. You can\u0027t erase the past, but I\u0027m going to try and make other people forget it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the park and gaze at the familiar, old oak tree I climbed when I was a kid. Drew and I once had a contest who could climb the highest. I won, right before the branch I was on snapped and I fell to the ground. I had a cast on my arm for six weeks after that fall, but I didn\u0027t care. I\u0027d won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up, trying to locate that broken branch. Is it still here, evidence of that day long ago? Or has the tree gone through enough seasons to erase the past?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intake of breath takes me by surprise as I circle the tree. Right in front of me, sitting leaning against the trunk of the old oak, is Maggie Armstrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI notice movement beside me and realize I\u0027m not alone. I snap my head up. There\u0027s a guy standing in front of me, one I recognize from my nightmares. He isn\u0027t a figment of my imagination, either. It\u0027s really him--Caleb Becker in the flesh, looking up as if searching for something important. A big gasping sound automatically escapes from my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hears me and quickly focuses on me. He doesn\u0027t move, not even when his icy blue eyes connect with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s grown in the past year. He acted tough back then, but now Caleb has a menacing look about him. His hair is cut short, his shirt is unbuttoned, showing off his muscled chest. That, combined with the tight-fitting pants he\u0027s wearing, screams danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t breathe. I\u0027m paralyzed. With anger. With anxiety. With fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re at an impasse, neither of us speaking. Just staring. I don\u0027t even think I\u0027m able to blink. I\u0027m frozen in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been face to face with him many times, but now everything has changed. He doesn\u0027t even look like himself, except for his straight nose and confident stance that has been, and I suppose always will be, Caleb Becker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is awkward,\" he says, breaking the long silence. His voice is deeper and darker than I remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not just seeing him out of my bedroom window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s oh, so different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeding to go back to the safety of my bedroom, I try to stand. A hot, shooting pain races down the side of my leg and I wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch in horror and shock as he steps forward and grabs my elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. My. God. I automatically jerk away from his grip. Memories of being stuck in a hospital bed unable to move crash through my mind as I straighten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds his hands up as if I just said \"Stick \u0027em up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be afraid of me, Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ... yes I do,\" I say, panicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear him let out a breath, then he steps back. But he doesn\u0027t leave, he just stares at me strangely. \"We used to be friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a long time ago,\" I say. \"Before you hit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an accident. And I paid my debt to society for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a totally surreal moment, and one I don\u0027t want to last longer than it has to. While my insides shake from nervousness, I say, \"You may have paid your debt to society, but what about your debt to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the words leave my lips, I can\u0027t believe I\u0027ve said them. I turn away and limp back home without a backward glance. I don\u0027t stop until I open the front door of my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reach my room, I sit inside my closet and close the door like I used to do when I wanted to block out my parents\u0027 fights. All I had to do was close my eyes and put my hands over my ears ... and hum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes. The image of Caleb, standing in front of me with those intense blue eyes of his, is branded in my brain. Even though he\u0027s nowhere near, I can still hear his dark voice. The night of the accident, the pain I\u0027ve suffered, my whole life changing, it all races back to haunt me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to hum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m being tested. Jail. Mom. Leah. Dad. And now Maggie. When I left Mom\u0027s ridiculous party, the last thing I needed was to come face to face with Maggie. She looked at me as if I\u0027d run over her again, given half a chance. I only talked to her because ... because maybe I wanted to prove to her that I\u0027m not the evil monster she obviously thinks I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still standing in the park like an idiot. Wind makes the leaves of the trees rustle as if they\u0027re talking to each other. I look up at the old oak. In a few months those talking leaves will fall to the ground and die, only to be replaced by new leaves and new gossip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now I feel like an old leaf. I went away, and deep inside a part of me has died. I vowed I\u0027d come back to Paradise and get that life back, that old life where everything was easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean against the oak, its trunk so thick nothing but a bulldozer could destroy it. If I could be like the tree instead of an insignificant leaf. I would talk to my mom, to Maggie, to Leah ... I\u0027d be strong enough to convince them to stop acting like the accident had to change everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an accident, for heaven\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid in jail who stabbed the girl ... that was no accident. Julio dealing drugs for money ... that was no accident. I\u0027m not saying driving drunk isn\u0027t a crime--it is. And when I pled guilty to the charges, I was ready to take whatever punishment the judge ordered--without regrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was accused of the crime, I did the time. It\u0027s over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s one glitch: Maggie Armstrong doesn\u0027t want to forgive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said I haven\u0027t paid my debt to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there any end to this punishment I\u0027ve put upon myself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wont let Maggie, or my family, make me unfocused. If being stuck in the DOC didn\u0027t screw me up, the people in Paradise can\u0027t. My sister is going to have to figure out why she thinks being a fuckin\u0027 weirdo outcast is better than going back to the way things were before I left. And my mom is going to, somehow, get real and stop acting like she\u0027s in a movie. My dad ... my dad\u0027s gonna have to grow some balls one of these days. And Maggie ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u0027s going to have to realize that the accident was just that... an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what happens, I\u0027m not leaving Paradise. She might as well get used to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all better get used to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was the party?\" Mom asks as she irons her uniform for work the next morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your leg okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine.\" I haven\u0027t even thought about my leg this morning; it\u0027s the least of my worries. I\u0027m obsessing about Spain. Last night, seeing Caleb reinforced my determination to leave this town. \"Did we get the packet from the International Student Exchange Program yet?\" The website said the packets would arrive a week ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom continues ironing. \"I haven\u0027t seen it. I hope it includes information about wheelchair accessibility. If your leg starts giving you problems, you\u0027ll have to get one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, please. Do we always have to discuss the what ifs?\"I head to the refrigerator walking as straight as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t hurt to be prepared, Maggie. I won\u0027t be there to push you along or help you once you\u0027re there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine, Mom. Stop worrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s sad. One minute Mom is pushing me to go out and do things with my friends like before. In the next breath she\u0027s being overprotective, overconcerned and smothering. She contradicts herself all the time. I think it\u0027s because she\u0027s trying to act as a take-charge father and protective mother all at once. She\u0027s getting all confused in the process. She\u0027s confusing me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts the iron down and gives me a big hug. \"I want you to go to Spain. You\u0027ve been looking forward to it for so long. But I also need to know you\u0027re taken care of. It\u0027s only because I love you so much, you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I squeak out. I don\u0027t add that her love, like her hugs, can smother a person to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m playing a one-man game of pool in the basement while my transition coach is yakking to my parents upstairs in the living room. If the situation weren\u0027t so invasive, I would find it frickin\u0027 hilarious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy transition coach is Damon Manning, a guy who went through the juvenile justice system just as I did. He\u0027s assigned to check up on me and supervise my community service. Lucky me. I have a parole officer with a fancy title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s bullshit, but Damon\u0027s report will go directly to a judge assigned to my case and the review committee, so I have to play nice. It won\u0027t be easy. I\u0027ve been on edge since I\u0027ve been home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Damon right before I left the DOC. The guy is a big black man who doesn\u0027t take shit from anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad sticks his head into the basement as I accidentally sink the eight ball. \"Caleb,\" he calls out. \"Mr. Manning is ready for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enter the living room and watch my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you anything?\" she asks Damon nervously. She\u0027s not used to big, black ex-cons in her house, but she\u0027s still playing the consummate hostess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I\u0027ll just be having a little chat with your son, then be on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down in one of the silk-cushioned chairs, but Damon immediately stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go for a walk,\" Damon says. It\u0027s not a suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"Sure. Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon holds onto a manila folder while we walk down Masey Avenue toward the park and end up sitting on a picnic bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s it goin\u0027?\" Damon asks. The guy opens his folder and clicks his pen. Click. Click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be more specific.\" Damon makes it sound like an order. Everything the guy says sounds like an order. It just winds my nerves that much tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. Click. \"Tell me about your family. Seems like you\u0027ve got a pretty nice home life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems being the operative word. \"Listen, my mom is a robot, my dad\u0027s a wimp, and my sister is a fuckin\u0027 zombie. I\u0027d say that pretty much sums it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Damon close his folder then look straight at me. \"Nobody said it would be easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well nobody said it was gonna be this fuckin\u0027 hard, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it make you feel like a big guy to cuss in every sentence that comes out of your mouth?\" \"Lay off, man.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-5.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
