He’ll be burned to death in there in less than a minute! What’s he mean about Crooked Nose?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hanged if I know! But don’t stop to ask questions. Go on up. I’ll be right after you. We’ve got to get him. Stand firm, Bob!” Jerry yelled to his chum at the foot of the ladder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Right!” answered the stout one, making his voice heard above the various noises of the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Up the ladder went Ned and Jerry, pausing a moment as they got to the point where they could look into the room. The smoke had blown away for the time being.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There he is!” cried Ned, pointing to a figure huddled on the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two boys leaped into the room, taking big gulps of fresh air to hold in their lungs as long as possible, for they saw that the wind was blowing the smoke into the room again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They caught hold of the old man. He appeared[34] to be a Frenchman, though he spoke good English. The boys lifted him up, and this seemed to restore his scattered senses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait! Wait!” he murmured. “My money! I must get my money. And that jewelry! Crooked Nose got some of it, but I hid the most. He shan’t have it! I must save it. In the iron box! Get it for me! Don’t let Crooked Nose have it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He’s raving!” said Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t talk! Save your breath!” mumbled Jerry, doing just what he warned his chum against. “Catch hold and——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not finish, but nodded in the direction of the open window. The room was lighted by the reflection of flames outside. Ned understood, and, taking hold of the old man’s legs one of which seemed to be crippled, while Jerry supported his head, they carried him to the casement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jerry got out first, while Ned held the old man, who kept muttering something about “Crooked Nose,” and “money and jewelry.” The boys paid little attention then, though the time was to come when the incident would be brought back to them in a startling manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once again on the ladder, Jerry called:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now work him out till he hangs over my shoulder like a sack of flour, Ned. I can carry[35] him down that way. He isn’t heavy. Hold him steady until I give the word.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All right,” answered his chum, and then the two proceeded to save the old man. Ned shifted the burden until it rested on the window sill. The Frenchman was either unconscious now, or incapable of motion, for he was as limp and inert as Jerry could wish, and he was easier to handle in that way. Getting him over his shoulder, as he might a sack of flour, Jerry started down the ladder with his burden.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ned gave one last look around the room where the old man seemed to have lived all alone. There was a bed in one corner, and a stove in the other, with a few poor possessions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t see anything of Crooked Nose or a box of money, or jewelry either,” murmured Ned. “I guess he was out of his head through fear. I might take another look, but——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then there was a sound indicating that a large portion of the structure had fallen in. This was followed by such a burst of flame and smoke into the room that Ned was almost trapped. He made a dive for the window and got out on the ladder. Down it he hurried, after Jerry and his burden, and he was not a moment too soon, for an instant later the flames burst from the window in a volume sufficient to have overwhelmed any one who had been in the apartment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [36]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Just in time,” murmured Ned, as he came to the ground, a few seconds after Jerry reached it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Willing hands took the burden of the old man, and he was carried to a place where volunteer nurses and a physician worked over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By this time the tenement house was a mass of flames. The fire involved the end where the old Frenchman had lived, and there was no hope of saving it. The place was like a tinder-box, and soon after Jerry and Ned had left it the roof at that end fell in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Quickly the fire burned itself out, and then came the problem of caring for the unfortunates who had lost nearly everything, and who were homeless. Kind friends and neighbors took in such as they could.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How’s our Frenchman?” asked Ned of Jerry, as they were about to go to their automobile and depart for home, since the high point of the excitement had passed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know. We might take a look.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A policeman directed them to a near-by store, where several firemen and spectators had been treated for cuts from glass or partial smoke suffocation, and there the boys found the old Frenchman. He was a cripple, with a stiff left leg, and had suffered much from shock. He was in great distress of mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “These are the boys who brought you down[37] the ladder, who saved you,” said a doctor, pointing to Ned and Jerry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man murmured something in his own expressive language, and then, as if realizing that the boys could not understand very well, though they knew some French, he said, in English:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I can never thank you enough! You saved my life! But tell me, did you see Crooked Nose or my iron box of money and jewelry?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” answered Jerry gently. He thought the old man was still wandering in his faculties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who is Crooked Nose?” asked Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is a villain!” exclaimed the Frenchman, whose name, some one said, was Jules Cardon. “He is a villain who tried to rob me of all I had. He got some of my money and some of the jewelry, but the rest I put in the iron box and locked. Then I hid it. But the fire came and I could not find it. Then I remember no more. But if you find Crooked Nose you will catch a great scoundrel, and perhaps find my money and the precious jewelry.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is Crooked Nose a man?” asked Jerry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes. He came to see me this evening. He knew me in France—many years ago. He demanded money. I would not give it to him, and he said he would take it, or he would—— Well, he made threats. I hid most of the money and[38] the jewelry, but I forgot where I put it when the fire came. Oh, was it burned?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, if it was left in there I should say it was,” replied Jerry, as he looked at the glowing ruins. “Nothing much left there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But maybe Crooked Nose took it,” suggested Mr. Cardon. “He is a villain.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s his name?” asked Bob.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The crippled old Frenchman shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It would be of no use to tell you,” he said. “He changes his name too often. Crooked Nose, I call him. He can’t change that!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old man seemed much improved, bodily, but his mental anguish was pitiable. Again and again he implored to be allowed to go back and look for his money, but of course this could not be. What was left of the ruins was a mass of blazing wood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, when he seemed to think that all was lost, the old man became calmer, and told a more connected story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old Frenchman was an engraver by trade and had worked for many years in New York, doing fine engraving for some leading jewelers. Then he had become crippled by an accident and had moved to Cresville for his health. In Cresville he had managed to pick up considerable work from the local jewelers, doing the engraving on rings, watches, and silver and gold ware for them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [39]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have much jewelry to engrave!” he said, with a sorrowful shake of his head. “I have a fine gold watch, and a silver tea set, and a magnificent diamond brooch, and other things. Now—where are they?” and he shrugged his shoulders despairingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Gee, that will be a big loss for somebody!” remarked Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just before the fire broke out the old Frenchman had had a visitor. This, as he explained, was a “queer stick of a man with a very crooked nose.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He got it in a fight in France many years ago,” said Mr. Cardon. “I had not seen him in a long time. How he found me and my money and the jewelry I do not know. But he threatened, and would have hurt me, had I not given him some. But I hid the most of it, and then the fire came. It came after Crooked Nose went out. Maybe he set the blaze. He was wicked enough. Oh, my money is lost—and that jewelry I was trusted with!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is if it was in there. But maybe that fellow you call Crooked Nose got it,” suggested Jerry. “You can have a look in the ruins after they cool.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing more the motor boys could do, and, learning that some of the neighbors[40] would care for the old Frenchman, they got ready to go home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hadn’t we better go back and see what has become of Professor Snodgrass?” asked Bob, as they reached their automobile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, it might be a good plan,” agreed Jerry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Some of the bugs he is after may have carried him off,” suggested Ned, with a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They started for the place where the runaway fire horses had been caught by Mr. Snodgrass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This has been what you might call a ‘large’ evening,” remarked Jerry, as he guided the car.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Somewhat juicy,” added Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Speaking of juicy reminds me of a broiled steak,” put in Bob. “What do you say to a little supper? I’m hungry.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “For once I agree with your gastronomic suggestion,” replied Jerry. “What say, Ned?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m with you. Let’s include the professor if we can find him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They reached the scene where they had last observed their friend, but he was not in sight. The horse lay there, having been shot to end its suffering, and then the boys went on into town.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There they telephoned to their people that they were all right and would be home later, at the same time mentioning the fact that Professor Snodgrass was in town, and would probably call[41] if he did not get on some bug-hunting chase that kept him out all night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the boys entered a restaurant they almost collided with, or, rather, were fairly run into by, a man who seemed in great haste. He acted in a peculiar manner, turning his face aside as if to escape observation, and hurried on out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, you’re a gentleman!” angrily murmured Jerry, who had received the full impact of the odd character.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Didn’t even say: ‘Excuse me!’ did he?” asked Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nothing like it. He must be going to catch a train!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bob, who was just behind his chums, turned quickly and looked after the man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did you see him?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did I see him. I felt him!” declared Jerry, with a rueful laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And did you notice?” went on Bob, in some excitement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Notice what?” Ned inquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “His crooked nose! It was all on one side of his face. Say, fellows, maybe that’s the man who tried to rob the old Frenchman!” exclaimed Bob in a tense whisper.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1662/49019.html","bookId":1198,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:30 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:30 AM"}
