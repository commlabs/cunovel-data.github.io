Fatty Long, my greatest regret now is that I did not snatch Weiqing over from your hands. At that time, I only thought that he had the six Attributes, such a rare opportunity, and I also had other disciples… so I let you have him.

Currently, she had just stepped into her thirties, but Zhou Weiqing was barely in his young twenties. The years of fierce battles and a hard life had left its mark on her, and she was no longer that same level of beauty like the Shangguan Sisters or Tian’er.

According to Ming Yu, the Heavenly Bow Empire looked to be in a great situation, but in truth they were in grave danger. Of course, their backs were secure, but the problem was with just their army of over hundred thousand men, if they had to face against the full might of the one behind the Kalise Empire, the Bai Da Empire… could they really withstand it? Towards this point, even Ming Yu did not have full confidence.

The invasion of the Heavenly Bow City was absolutely critical, especially since they needed to save the Royal Family of the Heavenly Bow Empire, as well as Zhou Weiqing’s own family. However, this also posed the greatest problem to them now. A forceful siege was not possible. Even if they ignored the fact that Zhou Weiqing’s family was there, none of the Heavenly Bow Empire warriors would be willing to risk the destruction of the Royal Family to enter the Heavenly Bow Empire. If they gave the order to attack just like that, the morale of the soldiers would definitely be greatly affected.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“...

Since the Heavenly Bow City isn’t particularly large, they are unable to station too many troops in the city itself. As such, they are mainly using the Heavenly Bow City as a central base of operations, heavily fortifying it while they constantly clear out the Star Forest around it. Already, a large number of Star Trees have been chopped down and transported away. Currently, their military force consists of around fifteen Regiments, but their actual combat might is definitely no match for us directly. Out of the fifteen Regiments, ten or so will belong to the Kalise, a force they have built up over all these years. As for the rest, they should be from the Bai Da Empire. Currently, from the state of things, they do not show any signs of sending more reinforcements.
