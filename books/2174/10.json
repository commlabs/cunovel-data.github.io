There was dust in this cavernous street rising up and almost concealing a distant tracery of bridges. Potter wondered at the dust. It was as though the director of local weather allowed dust here in an unconscious passion of naturalness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bulky man hurried past them and Potter was caught by the look of his hands - thick wrists, bulging knuckles, horned callouses. He had no idea what work could cause such deformity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide steered them now onto a succession of drop walks and into the cave of an alley. The swarm was left behind. A feeling of detachment seized Potter. He felt he was re- living an old and familiar experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I come with this person? he wondered. The guide wore the wheeled blazon of a transport driver on his shoulder, but he\u0027d said right out he was from the Parents Underground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know what you did for us,\u0027 he\u0027d said. \u0027Now, we will do something for you.\u0027 A turn of the head. \u0027Come.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d talked only briefly after that, but Potter had known from the first the guide had correctly identified himself. This was no trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why did I accept the invitation? Potter asked himself. Certainly it wasn\u0027t for the veiled promises of extended life and instant knowledge. There were Cyborgs behind this, of course, and he suspected this guide might be one of them. Most of the Optimen and Servant Uppers tended to discount the Folk rumors that Cyborgs did exist, but Potter had never joined the cynics and scoffers. He could no more explain why than he could explain his presence here in this alley cave walking between dark plasmeld walls illuminated by the ghost flicker of overhead glowtubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter suspected he had at last rebelled against one of the three curses of their age - moderation, drugs and alcohol. Narco-pleasures and alcohol had tempted him in their time... and finally moderation. He knew it wasn\u0027t normal for the times. Better to take up with one of the wild sex cults. But pointless sex without even the faint hope of issue had palled on him, although he knew this for a sign of final dissolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alley opened into one of the lost squares of the megalopolis - a triangular paving and fountain that looked to be real stone, green with the slime of ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Optimen don\u0027t know about this place. Potter thought They despised stone which eroded and wore away - in their time. Regenerative plasmeld was the thing. It stood unmoved and unmoving for all time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide slowed as they reached the open air. Potter noted a faint smell of chemicals about the man, oily sweetness, and a tiny scar running diagonally down the back of his neck into his collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn\u0027t he try to blackmail me into coming? Potter wondered. Could he be that sure? Could anyone know me that well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We have a job for you,\u0027 the guide had said. \u0027An operation you must perform.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity is my weakness. Potter thought. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide put a hand on Potter\u0027s arm, said, \u0027Stop. Wait without moving.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone was conversational, calm, but Potter felt hidden tensions. He looked up and around. The buildings were window-less, faceless. A wide door stood out in the angle of another alleyway ahead. They had come almost around the fountain without encountering another person. Nothing stirred or moved around them. There was only the faint rumbling of distant machinery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What is it?\u0027 Potter whispered. \u0027Why\u0027re we waiting?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nothing,\u0027 the guide said. \u0027Wait.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter thrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind veered back to the first encounter with this creature. How could they know what I achieved with that embryo? It must be the computer nurse. She\u0027s one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide had refused to say. came because I hoped they could help me solve the mystery of the Durant embryo, he thought. They were the source of the arginine intrusion - that\u0027s what I suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of Svengaard\u0027s description - a contrail-like intrusion. It had deposited arginine-rich sperm protamine through the coiled alpha-helices of the embryo\u0027s cells. Then had come the operation - the cysteine masked, neutralized with sulfhydryl and the ATP phase... oligomycin and azide... the exchange reaction inhibited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter stared up at the patch of blue sky framed by the buildings around the square. His mind, concentrated on the Durant cutting, had encountered a new idea. He no longer saw the sky. His awareness was back within the swarming cell structure, following the mitochondrial systems like an undersea hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It could be repeated,\u0027 Potter whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Silence,\u0027 the guide hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter nodded. On any embryo at all. he thought. The key\u0027s the a gmine flooding. I could duplicate that myself on the basis of Sven\u0027s description. Gods! We could make billions of Durant embryos! And every one of them self-viable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, dismayed by the realization that -with the record tape erased - his memory might be the only container of that entire operation and its implications. Sven- gaard and the computer nurse could have only part of it. They hadn\u0027t been in there, immersed in the heart of the cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brilliant surgeon might deduce what had happened and be able to reproduce the operation from the partial records, but only if he were set the problem. Who would ever take up this problem? Not the Optimen. Not that dolt Svengaard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide tugged at Potter\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter looked down into that flat, chill-eyed face with its lack of genetic identification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We are observed,\u0027 the guide said in an oddly depersonalized tone. \u0027Listen to me very carefully. Your life depends on it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter shook his head, blinked. He felt removed from his own person, become only a set of senses to record this man\u0027s words and actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You will go through that door ahead of us,\u0027 the guide said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter turned, looked at the door. Two men carrying paper-wrapped parcels emerged from the alley in front of it, hurried around the square opposite them. The guide ignored them. Potter heard a babble of young voices growing louder in the alley. The guide ignored these, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Inside that building, you will take the first door on your left,\u0027 he said. \u0027You will see a woman there operating a voicebox. You will say to her: \u0027My shoe pinches.\u0027 She will say: \u0027Everyone has troubles.\u0027 She will take care of you from there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter found his voice: \u0027What if... she\u0027s not there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen go through the door behind her desk and out through the adjoining office into a rear hall. Turn left and go to the rear of the building. You will find there a man in a loader supervisor\u0027s uniform, striped gray and black. You will repeat the procedure with him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What about you?\u0027 Potter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That is not your concern. Quickly, now!\u0027 The guide gave him a push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter stumbled towards the door just as a woman in a teacher\u0027s uniform emerged from the alley leading a file of children between him and the bolt hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter\u0027s shocked senses took in the scene - children, all dressed in tight shorts that revealed their long flamingo legs. They were all around him suddenly and he was bulling his way through toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, someone screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter lurched against the door, found the handle, looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis guide had gone around to the opposite side of the fountain which concealed him now from the waist down, but what remained visible was enough to make Potter gasp and freeze. The man\u0027s chest was bare revealing a single milky white dome from which blazed a searing light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter turned left, saw a line of men emerging from another alley to be crisped and burned down by that searing light. The children were shouting, crying, falling back into the alley from which they had emerged, but Potter ignored them, fascinated by this slaughter- machine which he\u0027d thought was a human being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guide\u0027s arms lifted, pointed overhead. From the extended fingers, lancets of searing blue stabbed upward. Where the light terminated, aircars tumbled from the sky. The air all around had become an ozone-crackling inferno punctuated by explosions, screams, hoarse shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter stood there watching, unable to move, forgetful of his instructions on the door or his hand upon the door\u0027s handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturn fire was coming now at the guide. His clothing shriveled, vanished in smoke to reveal an armored body with muscles that had to be plasmeld fibers. The ravening beams continued to blaze from his hands and chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter found he no longer could bear to watch. He wrenched the door open, stumbled through into the relative gloom of a yellow-walled foyer. He slammed the door behind him as an explosion rocked the building. The door rattled behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his left, a door was flung open. A tiny blue-eyed blonde woman stood there staring at him. Potter found himself oddly recognizing the markers of her genetic cut, reassured by the touch of humanity in these tiny betrayals. He could see the cabinet of a voicebox in the room behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My shoe pinches,\u0027 Potter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gulped. \u0027Everyone has troubles.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I am Dr Potter,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think my escort has just been killed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped aside, said, \u0027In here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter lurched past her into an office with lines of empty desk. His mind was a turmoil. He felt shaken to his roots by the implications of the violence he had just witnessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman took his arm, herded him toward another door. \u0027Through here,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027ll have to go into the service tubes. That\u0027s the only way. They\u0027ll have this place surrounded in minutes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter stopped, figuratively dug in his heels. He hadn\u0027t counted on violence. He didn\u0027t know what he had expected, but not that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where\u0027re we going?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027Why do you want me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t you know?\u0027 she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He... never said.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everything\u0027U be explained,\u0027 she said. \u0027Hurry.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t move a millimeter until you tell me,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA raw street oath escaped her lips. She said, \u0027If I must I must. You\u0027re to implant the Durant embryo in its mother. It\u0027s the only way we can get it out of here.\u0027 In the mother?\u0027 \u0027In the ancient way,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know it\u0027s disgusting, but it\u0027s the only way. Now, hurry!\u0027 Potter allowed himself to be herded through the door. Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN the control center, their red Survey Globe, the Tuyere occupied the thrones on the pivoting triangle, reviewing data and reviewing data - correlating, deducing, commanding. The 120-degree scan of curved wall available to each of them flashed with data in numerous modes - pictorially in the spying screens, as probability function in mathematical read-outs, as depth-module decision analogues, as superiorinferior unit apportionments pictured in free-flowing pyramids, as visual reports reduced to cubed grids of binaries according to relative values, as motivational curves weighted for actionreaction and presented in flowing green lines...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the upper quadrants, scanner eyes glittered to show how many of the Optimen were sitting in on the globe\u0027s activity -over a thousand this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalapine worried the prescription ring on her left thumb, felt the abortive hum of power in it as she twisted and slid it along her skin. She was restless, full of demands for which she could find no names. The duties of the globe were becoming repellent, her companions hateful. In here, time settled into more of a continuous blur without days or nights. Every companion she had ever known grew to be the same companion, merged, endlessly merged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Once more have I studied the protein synthesis tape on the Durant embryo,\u0027 Nourse said. He glanced at Calapine in the reflector beside his head, drummed the arm of his throne with fingers that moved back and forth, back and forth on the carved plasmeld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Something we\u0027ve missed, something we\u0027ve missed,\u0027 Calapine mocked. She looked at Schruille, caught him rubbing his hands along his robe at his thighs, a motion that seemed filled with stark betrayal of nervousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now it happens I\u0027ve discovered the thing we missed,\u0027 Nourse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA movement of Schruille\u0027s head caught Nourse\u0027s attention. He turned. For a moment, they stared at each other in the prisms. Nourse found it interesting that Schruille betrayed a tiny skin blemish beside his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd, Nourse thought. How could one of us have a blemish such as that? Surely there could be no emymic imbalance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, what is it?\u0027 Schruille demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ve a blemish beside your nose,\u0027 Nourse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You deduce this from the embryo\u0027s tape?\u0027 Calapine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Eh? Oh... no, of course not.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what is it you\u0027ve discovered?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Well... it seems rather obvious now that the operation Potter performed may be repeatable - given that general type of embryo and proper administration of sperm prota- mine.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you deduced the course of the operation?\u0027 Calapine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not precisely, but in outline, yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Potter could repeat it?\u0027 she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Perhaps even Svengaard.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Guard and preserve us,\u0027 Calapine muttered. It was a ritual formula whose words seldom caught an Optiman\u0027s conscious attention, but she heard herself this time and the word \u0027preserve\u0027 stood out as though outlined in fire. She whirled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where is Max?\u0027 Schruille asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whine in Schruille\u0027s voice brought a sneer to Nourse\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Max is working,\u0027 Nourse said. He is busy.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille looked up at the watching scanners, thinking of all their fellows behind those lensed eyes - the Actionists seeing events as a new demand upon their talents, not realizing what violence might be unleashed here; the Emotionals, fearful and complaining, rendered almost ineffective by guilt feelings; the Cynics, interested by the new game (most of the watchers, Schruille felt, were Cynics); the Hedonists, angered by the current sense of urgent emergency, worried because such matters interfered with their enjoyments; and the Effetes, looking in all this for something new at which to sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill we now develop a new party? Schruille asked himself. Will we now have the Brutals, all sensitivity immured by the needs of self-preservation? Nourse and Calapine haven\u0027t faced this as yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, he shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Max calls,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027I have him in my transient screen.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille and Nourse flicked their channel duplicators, looked down at Allgood\u0027s swarthy, solid, muscular figure in the transient screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I report,\u0027 Allgood said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalapine watched the Security chiefs face. He appeared oddly distracted, fearful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What of Potter?\u0027 Nourse asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why does he delay his answer?\u0027 Schruille asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s because he worships us,\u0027 Calapine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Worship is a product of fear,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Perhaps there\u0027s something he wishes to show us, a projection or an evidential sub-datum. Is that it. Max?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood stared out of the screen, looking from one to the other. They\u0027d gotten tied up in that lost-time sense again, the endless word play and disregard for time in the quest for data, data, data - that side effect of endless life, the supra-involve-ment in trivia. This time, he hoped it would go on without end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where is Potter?\u0027 Nourse demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood swallowed. \u0027Potter has... temporarily eluded us.\u0027 He knew better than to lie or evade now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Eluded?\u0027 Schruille asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How?\u0027 Nourse asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was... violence,\u0027 Allgood said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-10.html","bookId":2174,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM"}
