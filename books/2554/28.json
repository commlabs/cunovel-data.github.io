{"id":111887,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re thoroughly confused and have a million questions,\" Drexler said. \"But I can answer them all with one simple statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in a shadowed, recessed doorway across the street from the loft building, watching the entrance. The fresh cold air was like a tonic for Jack. The nausea had receded and his head felt clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish to prevent the Change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack almost laughed. \"As the saying goes, \u0027I may have been born at night, but not last night.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really expect me to believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping that what just transpired in that loft would add credence to my statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack digested that, looking for the angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRasalom knew Glaeken was powerless, leaving only the Lady blocking his path to the Change. He knew too that Jack was the Heir. So how could Drexler\u0027s approaching him with this off-the-wall change of heart work to Rasalom\u0027s advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack couldn\u0027t see the trip wire - at least not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor could he see how this could have been set up. No one had known he\u0027d be visiting Drexler tonight. No time to set up a big-store type scam like this. Especially since it involved the deaths of three members of the Order, including Drexler\u0027s right-hand man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say I buy that. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not something I care to discuss. Take it or leave it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait ... something Szeto had said tonight ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI answer only to the One. In fact, soon I may be Drexler\u0027s master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas a palace coup in the offing? Or threatened? Was that why Drexler had executed Szeto?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack tried to read Drexler\u0027s expression in the shadows as he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think the One is going to abandon you when the Change comes. Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrexler didn\u0027t react. \"I repeat: I want to stop the Change. Take it or leave it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think killing off the Order\u0027s enforcers is the way to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only way I know to stop the Change is to stop the One. You told me tonight that you are set on doing that. Therefore our goals are confluent. I will help you make the attempt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"\u0027Attempt.\u0027 Not exactly a vote of confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am nothing if not a realist and a pragmatist. And you ... you are not a fool. You must know you face a daunting challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack sighed. \"Yeah. I do. But if I find him, I\u0027m gonna hit him with everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must. It must be your personal Armageddon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the key word is find. If I can\u0027t find him, I can\u0027t take him out. You\u0027ve no idea where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrexler shook his head. \"None. But I haven\u0027t been looking. That changes as of tonight. I will work with you. Only you. No one must know of my involvement. Are we agreed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack hesitated. This was the weirdest damn turn of events. Working with Ernst Drexler against the One. Surreal. So surreal, he couldn\u0027t fully buy into it. Blagden seemed a dead end. Rasalom and the Order were connected, so tapping into the Order\u0027s datastream seemed a good way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d keep one eye looking over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack extended his hand. \"Agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrexler looked about to say something when his gaze fixed over Jack\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned and saw Hank Thompson fast-walking along the sidewalk, carrying a paper bag. Containing an X-Acto knife, perhaps? To remove a man\u0027s eyelids?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack fought the urge to start after him ... and failed. But Drexler grabbed his arm as he stepped from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I have need of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they waited for Thompson to enter the loft building, Jack said, \"One last question: When you let Hans and Fritz through the door - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hans and Fritz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two German guys. Why did you step out and close it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obvious, I should think: I didn\u0027t want to risk blood spatters on my suit or coat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Obvious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Thompson was through the entrance, Drexler handed Jack the balled-up remnants of the duct tape that had bound him, then hurried across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack watched him go. So weird. Could he trust Drexler to hold up his end of the bargain? Well, at least as long as their goals remained - to use his term - confluent. Jack harbored no doubt that if Drexler got a better offer, their deal would be as dead as Szeto and the Katzenjammers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-28.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
