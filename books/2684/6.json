We\u0027re casting.\" I wait as long as I can, then I knock back the drink and light a cigarette. \"For some reason the producer and director think my input\u0027s important. Valuable. They\u0027re artists.\" I take a drag off the cigarette. \"It\u0027s basically a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s cool,\" Julian says. \"It\u0027s all about control, right?\" He considers something. \"It\u0027s not a joke.

I concentrate on that. I\u0027m already locked out of everything.

This makes it clear he has information he wants to give me. I realize that I sat here, in this very same booth, one afternoon with Blair, in a different era, something I wouldn\u0027t have remembered if I hadn\u0027t seen her tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we lost again, Julian?\" I sigh. \"Are we gonna play out another scene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you\u0027ve been gone a long time and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you even know about that?\" I ask suddenly. \"You and I weren\u0027t hanging then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" he asks. \"I saw you last summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about Meghan Reynolds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone told me you were helping her out ... giving her a break - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were f**king, Julian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said that you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what she said.\" I stand up. \"Everyone lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he says softly. \"It\u0027s just a code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Everyone lies.\" I stub the cigarette out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just another language you have to learn.\" Then he delicately adds, \"I think you need some coffee, dude.\" Pause. \"Why are you so angry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m out of here, Julian.\" I start walking away. \"As usual, a total mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blue Jeep follows me from the Beverly Hills Hotel to where the cab drops me off in front of the Doheny Plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething has changed since I was here seven hours ago. I call the doorman while staring at the desk in my office. The computer is on. It wasn\u0027t when I left. I\u0027m staring at the stack of paper next to the computer. When the doorman answers I\u0027m staring at a small knife used to open envelopes that was placed on the stack of paper. It was in a drawer when I headed out to the premiere. I hang the phone up without saying anything. Moving around the condo I ask, \"Is anyone here?\" I lean over the duvet in the bedroom. I run my hand across it. It smells different. I check the door for the third time. It\u0027s locked. I stare at the Christmas tree longer than I should and then I take the elevator down to the lobby. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-6.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
