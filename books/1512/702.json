Accurately speaking, the battle between team China and team East Sea would be waged here in this violent storm, which looked much more violent than the real Perfect Storm. At the very least, The Perfect Storm hadn’t had purple lightning falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“I don’t know why, but I have a bad premonition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eIn the destroyer’s lounge, the various members of team China were having a leisurely free time. For example, Wangxia was reading the fantasy novel, Terror Infinity, Yingkong was reading romance novels, while Heng and Cheng Xiao were playing video games. The rest all had their own entertainment, and it looked very relaxed within the destroyer. Only Honglu was there thinking nonsense, pulling at his hair nonstop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Oh?

It’s just my premonition. I said it before, right? I can see the premonition of someone about to die on their body. Although all teams would have this feeling in movie worlds, and one very strong at that, so it can’t be used as the basis for deduction. However, Wangxia, Liu Yu and I have a very thick air of death around us that far surpasses normal.

It referred to the probability of team East Sea having a variable, based on the information they had grasped. The so-called 13% was too high. The probability was more likely to be below 5%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(Am I too sensitive?) Honglu smiled self-mockingly, hiding these feelings in his heart. However, he didn’t do so completely, still devoting a portion of his thoughts to scheming If team East Sea were really to have a deviation, what kind would it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eOn that day’s afternoon, the premonition in his heart got more and more acute, until the point that he couldn’t resist looking for Xuan, and asking him regarding this matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“If a deviation really appears for team East Sea, it could only be them hiding their power, and it’s one we can’t ignore, or one that is enough to give us heavy losses. This power could be either strength or intelligence, but if that 13% of variance really occurs, it could only be strength based on the current situation. A change in their strength can’t bring a large change to our scheme. Zheng is enough to deal with any changes in strength. So, if there are any deviations, we only need to guard against sneak attacks. We shouldn’t divide our forces, so that team East Sea won’t get a chance. The basic situation is like that.” Xuan pushed up his spectacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Indeed. Team East Sea’s decimation is already determined no matter how you reason it. Even if their luck is great and they manage to escape to the Diaoyu Islands, it wouldn’t cause us any harm. The only thing that could harm us is a powerful sneak attack. Alright, I agree with your suggestion. We won’t divide our forces. The whole team will stay together. We’ll proceed with team East Sea’s elimination like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(But… even if it’s just a 1% chance, what if team East Sea’s threat is wit, and not power?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“In summary, team China, or Xuan, can already determine team East Sea’s strength and intelligence from team East Sea’s previous crude actions. But, these crude actions happened to be able to form the foundation for my plan. With this as the idea, team China will next keep their team together and won’t divide their troops.

He was playing with two short flying swords in his hands. The transparent glass-like swords looked like toys. This man was currently in charge of Adam’s protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“A few is enough.” Adam smiled gently. “Who do you think they are? It’s team China, the strongest team apart from team Devil and us. No, perhaps, they win out slightly over us now. Neither belittle yourself nor be conceited. To handle team China, or to kill the leaders like Zheng, it would only be possible with a nuclear bomb or over ten warships in The Perfect Storm era. So, it’s sufficient killing just over three of them using a small team like team East Sea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe blonde youth laughed coldly. With some slight mockery, he said, “Hilarious. Does an allianceless team really need you to take them so seriously? You said before that there are only three types of battle. First, a battle between leaders, and a battle between soldiers. However, this is only suitable to teams with powerful individuals like us, team Devil and team China. Second, a hidden battle. Using sneak attacks, assassination or special battle methods in a vast area, which is primarily for unique enhancements or abilities, which is usually the battle style of slaver teams. The third one is a team alliance battle. With a powerhouse as the core, the team members and allies will complement him, systematically advancing and exhausting and defeating all powerful opponents. There are only these three types of battle, right? I don’t believe team China is a match for our Angel Alliance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Haha. That’s just because you’re too inexperienced.” Adam maintained his mild and harmless expression and tone as always. However, he continued sarcastically, “With your experience and intelligence, all you do is parrot me. You don’t have the qualifications to evaluate a strong team like team China.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe blonde youth’s face changed abruptly and he tightened his grip on his flying sword. However, a wave of killing intent was instantly transmitted from behind, and he could no longer move, cold sweat flowing from his pores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Song Tian, back so early?” \u0026nbsp;His expression unchanged, Adam looked at behind the blonde youth, where an Asian man carrying an antique looking Chinese broadsword on his back was standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eSong Tian silently nodded his head. “Fortunately I came back, or else our team would decrease by one person. For a team with as few numbers as us, we can’t lose members over something so trivial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe blonde youth finally feebly slumped down when Song Tian sat down. However, he immediately retreated ten metres away from Song Tian, before carefully sitting down. His eyes continued to lock onto Song Tian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe blonde youth was the most recent addition from another team’s leader to team Celestial. As he had already unlocked the third stage, and his enhancement and self-created abilities pertained to flying swords, his offence exceedingly great. He was extremely prideful towards his personal power, and even considered himself to be amongst team Celestial’s foremost combatants. He had also made huge contributions for a few movies, so it was hard to avoid having some slight disdain towards team Celestial’s leader, Adam, being a former team leader himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHowever, who would have expected that the silent man who usually didn’t flaunt his power would be able to stop him from daring to move in a moment with mere killing intent? He had felt as if there had been a peerlessly sharp sword directed at his neck from behind. If he had dared move, that sword would have mercilessly cut him down. He had only dared retreat when Song Tian sat down, keeping his attention on him. Even so, he didn’t dare attack even armed with a flying sword. Just Song Tian merely sitting down there casually exerted a mountain-like pressure on him, giving him no chance to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Newbie, some advice. Don’t act against the other members of team Celestial. Those who can enter this team aren\u0027t second-rate. If you want to survive the final battle, protect our strategist. If not for him, team Celestial would have been wiped several times over by now.” Song Tian gave the blonde youth a look, and said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eUnder that pressure, the blonde youth could only nod involuntarily. Only when he nodded and kept his flying sword did Song Tian gradually weaken the pressure on him. When it completely disappeared, Song Tian reverted back to being an ordinary man carrying a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe blonde youth exhaled. He sat there silently for over ten minutes, before jumping up, startled. “Impossible! With your strength and Adam’s intelligence, you still lost to team China before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eSong Tian and Adam exchanged a look, before Adam gave a warm smile. “A loss is a loss. There’s nothing to be surprised about. After all, no one can guarantee that they are invincible. The so-called invincible is only a relative thing. For example, you are invincible against an ordinary human, while clone Zheng Zha is similarly invincible against us. Of course, Song Tian and Luo Yinglong are invincible against you as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Impossible!” The blonde youth jumped up. “That variety show-like henpecked man?

Please slander others when they’re not around.” As the blonde youth started making a ruckus, Luo Yinglong and a girl of Western ancestry walked over.

It was a instinctive sense of danger, and was even stronger than the pressure Song Tian had exerted on him before.

Team China indeed doesn’t have an alliance. They don’t have the transworld communicator or team Devil’s strength, only one team. In this aspect, your words aren’t wrong. But you guessed wrongly on two counts. First, it’s team China’s relationship with us and team Devil. We are enemies, but not enemies to the death. The biggest enemies to the death in the Realm is team Devil! This isn’t changeable in the final battle.

Intelligence isn’t omnipotent. Our thinking is broader than ordinary human’s as our fundamental thinking process is different. However, we need sufficient information to infer and make judgements.
