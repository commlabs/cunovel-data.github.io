He was lying. He\u0027d only come outside to smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know I was out here?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always swim out here at night, Belly. Come on.\" He took a drag of his cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew I swam at night? I\u0027d thought it was my special secret, mine and Susannah\u0027s. I wondered how long he had known. I wondered if everyone knew. I didn\u0027t even know why it mattered, but it did. To me, it did. \"Okay, fine. Then when did you start smoking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Last year, maybe.\" He was being vague on purpose. It was maddening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you shouldn\u0027t. You should quit right now. Are you addicted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then quit. If you put your mind to it, I know you can.\" If he put his mind to it, I knew he could do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should, Conrad. Smoking is so bad for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you give me if I do?\" he asked teasingly. He held the cigarette in the air, above his beer can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air felt different all of a sudden. It felt charged, electric, like I had been zapped by a thunderbolt. I let go of the edge and started to tread water, away from him. It felt like forever before I spoke. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"You should quit for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he said, and the moment was over. He stood up and ground his cigarette out on the top of the can. \"Good night, Belly. Don\u0027t stay out here too late .You never know what kind of monsters come out at night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything felt normal again. I splashed water at his legs as he walked away. \"Screw you,\" I said to his back. A long time ago Conrad and Jeremiah and Steven convinced me that there was a child killer on the loose, the kind who liked chubby little girls with brown hair and grayish-blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! Are you quitting or not?\" I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer me. He just laughed. I could tell by the way his shoulders shook as he closed the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he left, I fell back into the water and floated. I could feel my heart beating through my ears. It thudded quick-quick-quick like a metronome. Conrad was different. I\u0027d sensed something even at dinner, before he\u0027d told me about Aubrey. He had changed. And yet, the way he affected me was still the same. It felt just exactly the same. It felt like I was at the top of the Grizzly at Kings Dominion, right about to go down the first hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belly, have you called your dad yet?\" my mother asked me. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should call him and tell him how you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"I doubt he\u0027s sitting at home worrying about it.\" \"Still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, have you made Steven call him?\" I countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t,\" she said, her tone level. \"Your dad and Steven are about to spend two weeks together looking at colleges. You, on the other hand, won\u0027t get to see him until the end of summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did she have to be so reasonable? Everything was that way with her. My mother was the only person I knew who could have a reasonable divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother got up and handed me the phone. \"Call your father,\" she said, leaving the room. She always left the room when I called my father, like she was giving me privacy. As if there were some secrets I needed to tell my father that I couldn\u0027t tell him in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t call him. I put the phone back in its cradle. He should be the one calling me; not the other way around. He was the father; I was just the kid. And anyway, dads didn\u0027t belong in the summer house. Not my father and not Mr. Fisher. Sure, they\u0027d come to visit, but it wasn\u0027t their place. They didn\u0027t belong to it. Not the way we all did, the mothers and us kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAGE 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were playing cards outside on the porch, and my mother and Susannah were drinking margaritas and playing their own card game. The sun was starting to go down, and soon the mothers would have to go inside and boil corn and hot dogs. But not yet. First they played cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurel, why do you call my mom Beck when everyone else calls her Susannah?\" Jeremiah wanted to know. He and my brother, Steven, were a team, and they were losing. Card games bored Jeremiah, and he was always looking for something more interesting to do, to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because her maiden name is Beck,\" my mother explained, grinding out a cigarette. They only smoked when they were together, so it was a special occasion. My mother said smoking with Susannah made her feel young again. I said it would shorten her life span by years but she waved off my worries and called me a doomsdayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a maiden name?\" Jeremiah asked. My brother tapped Jeremiah\u0027s hand of cards to get him back into the game, but Jeremiah ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lady\u0027s name before she gets married, dipwad,\" said Conrad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call him dipwad, Conrad,\" Susannah said automatically, sorting through her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why does she have to change her name at all?\" Jeremiah wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t. My name is Laurel Dunne, same as the day I was born. Nice, huh?\" My mother liked to feel superior to Susannah for not changing her name. \"After all, why should a woman have to change her name for a man? She shouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurel, please shut up,\" said Susannah, throwing a few cards down onto the table. \"Gin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother sighed, and threw her cards down too. \"I don\u0027t want to play gin anymore. Let\u0027s play something else. Let\u0027s play go fish with these guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sore loser,\" Susannah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, we\u0027re not playing go fish. We\u0027re playing hearts, and you can\u0027t play because you always try to cheat,\" I said. Conrad was my partner, and I was pretty sure we were going to win. I had picked him on purpose. Conrad was good at winning. He was the fastest swimmer, the best boogie boarder, and he always, always won at cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah clapped her hands together and laughed. \"Laur, this girl is you all over again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother said, \"No, Belly\u0027s her father\u0027s daughter,\" and they exchanged this secret look that made me want to say, \"What, what?\" But I knew my mother would never say. She was a secret-keeper, always had been. And I guessed I did look like my father: I had his eyes that turned up at the corners, a little girl version of his nose, his chin that jutted out. All I had of my mother was her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the moment was over and Susannah smiled at me and said, \"You\u0027re absolutely right, Belly. Your mother does cheat. She\u0027s always cheated at hearts. Cheaters never prosper, children.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-7.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
