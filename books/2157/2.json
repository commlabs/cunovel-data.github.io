Taraza, with access to the private records of her trainee, started calling the younger girl \"Dar.\" Odrade responded by calling Taraza \"Tar.\" The two names acquired a certain glue - Dar and Tar. Even after Reverend Mothers overheard and reprimanded them, they occasionally lapsed into error if only for the amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade, looking down at Taraza now, said: \"Dar and Tar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile twitched the edges of Taraza\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it in my records that you don\u0027t already know several times over?\" Odrade asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza sat back and waited for the chairdog to adjust itself to the new position. She rested her clasped hands on the tabletop and looked up at the younger woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much younger, really, Taraza thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince school, though, Taraza had thought of Odrade as completely removed into a younger age group, creating a gap no passage of years could close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Care at the beginning, Dar,\" Taraza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This project is well past its beginning,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But your part in it starts now. And we are launching ourselves into such a beginning as has never before been attempted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I now to learn the entire design for this ghola?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it. All the evidence of high-level dispute and the \"need to know\" cast away with a single word. But Odrade understood. There was an organizational rubric laid down by the original Bene Gesserit Chapter House, which had endured with only minor changes for millennia. Bene Gesserit divisions were cut by hard vertical and horizontal barriers, divided into isolated groups that converged to a single command only here at the top. Duties (for which read \"assigned roles\") were conducted within separated cells. Active participants within a cell did not know their contemporaries within other parallel cells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I know that the Reverend Mother Lucilla is in a parallel cell, Odrade thought. It\u0027s the logical answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized the necessity. It was an ancient design copied from secret revolutionary societies. The Bene Gesserit had always seen themselves as permanent revolutionaries. It was a revolution that had been dampened only in the time of the Tyrant, Leto II.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDampened, but not diverted or stopped, Odrade reminded herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what you\u0027re about to do,\" Taraza said, \"tell me if you sense any immediate threat to the Sisterhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of Taraza\u0027s peculiar demands, which Odrade had learned to answer out of wordless instinct, which then could be formed into words. Quickly, she said: \"If we fail to act, that is worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We reasoned that there would be danger,\" Taraza said. She spoke in a dry, remote voice. Taraza did not like calling up this talent in Odrade. The younger woman possessed a prescient instinct for detecting threats to the Sisterhood. It came from the wild influence in her genetic line, of course - the Atreides with their dangerous talents. There was a special mark on Odrade\u0027s breeding file: \"Careful examination of all offspring.\" Two of those offspring had been quietly put to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should not have awakened Odrade\u0027s talent now, not even for a moment, Taraza thought. But sometimes temptation was very great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza sealed the projector into her tabletop and looked at the blank surface while speaking. \"Even if you find a perfect sire, you are not to breed without our permission while you are away from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mistake of my natural mother,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mistake of your natural mother was to be recognized while she was breeding!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had heard this before. There was that thing about the Atreides line that required the most careful monitoring by the breeding mistresses. The wild talent, of course. She knew about the wild talent, that genetic force which had produced the Kwisatz Haderach and the Tyrant. What did the breeding mistresses seek now, though? Was their approach mostly negative? No more dangerous births! She had never seen any of her babies after they were born, not necessarily a curious thing for the Sisterhood. And she never saw any of the records in her own genetic file. Here, too, the Sisterhood operated with careful separation of powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those earlier prohibitions on my Other Memories!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had found the blank spaces in her memories and opened them. It was probable that only Taraza and perhaps two other councillors (Bellonda, most likely, and one other older Reverend Mother) shared the more sensitive access to such breeding information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Taraza and the other really sworn to die before revealing privileged information to an outsider? There was, after all, a precise ritual of succession should a key Reverend Mother die while away from her Sisters and with no chance to pass along her encapsulated lives. The ritual had been called into play many times during the reign of the Tyrant. A terrible period! Knowing that the revolutionary cells of the Sisterhood were transparent to him! Monster! She knew that her sisters had never deluded themselves that Leto II refrained from destroying the Bene Gesserit out of some deep-seated loyalty to his grandmother, the Lady Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you there, Jessica?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade felt the stirring far within. The failure of one Reverend Mother: \"She allowed herself to fall in love!\" Such a small thing but how great the consequences. Thirty-five hundred years of tyranny!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Path. Infinite? What of the lost megatrillions gone into the Scattering? What threat was posed by those Lost Ones returning now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though she read Odrade\u0027s mind, which sometimes she appeared to do, Taraza said: \"The Scattered ones are out there... just waiting to pounce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had heard the arguments: Danger on the one hand and on the other, something magnetically attractive. So many magnificent unknowns. The Sisterhood with its talents honed by melange over the millennia - what might they not do with such untapped resources of humanity? Think of the uncounted genes out there! Think of the potential talents floating free in universes where they might be lost forever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the not knowing that conjures up the greatest terrors,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the greatest ambitions,\" Taraza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then do I go to Rakis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In due course. I find you adequate to the task.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or you would not have assigned me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an old exchange between them, going right back to their school days. Taraza realized, though, that she had not entered it consciously. Too many memories tangled the two of them: Dar and Tar. Have to watch that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember where your loyalties are,\" Taraza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe existence of no-ships raises the possibility of destroying entire planets without retaliation. A large object, asteroid or equivalent, may be sent against the planet. Or the people can be set against each other by sexual subversion, and then can be armed to destroy themselves. These Honored Matres appear to favor this latter technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Bene Gesserit Analysis\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his position in the courtyard and even when not appearing to do so, Duncan Idaho kept his attention on the observers above him. There was Patrin, of course, but Patrin did not count. It was the Reverend Mothers across from Patrin who bore watching. Seeing Lucilla, he thought: That\u0027s the new one. This thought filled him with a surge of excitement, which he took out in renewed exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe completed the first three patterns of the training-play Miles Teg had ordered, vaguely aware that Patrin would report on how well he did. Duncan liked Teg and old Patrin and sensed that the feeling was reciprocated. This new Reverend Mother, though - her presence suggested interesting changes. For one thing, she was younger than the others. Also, this new one did not try to hide the eyes that were a first clue to her membership in the Bene Gesserit. His first glimpse of Schwangyu had confronted him with eyes concealed behind contact lenses that simulated non-addict pupils and slightly bloodshot whites. He had heard one of the Keep\u0027s acolytes say Schwangyu\u0027s lenses also corrected for \"an astigmatic weakness that has been accepted in her genetic line as a reasonable exchange for the other qualities she transmits to her offspring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time, most of this remark was unintelligible to Duncan but he had looked up the references in the Keep\u0027s library, references both scarce and severely limited in content. Schwangyu herself parried all of his questions on the subject, but the subsequent behavior of his teachers told him she had been angry. Typically, she had taken out her anger on others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat really upset her, he suspected, was his demand to know whether she was his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time now Duncan had known he was something special. There were places in the elaborate compound of this Bene Gesserit Keep where he was not permitted. He had found private ways to evade such prohibitions and had stared out often through thick plaz and open windows at guards and wide reaches of cleared ground that could be enfiladed from strategically positioned pillboxes. Miles Teg himself had taught the significance of enfilade positioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGammu, the planet was called now. Once, it had been known as Giedi Prime but someone named Gurney Halleck had changed that. It was all ancient history. Dull stuff. There still remained a faint smell of bitter oil in the planet\u0027s dirt from its pre-Danian days. Millennia of special plantations were changing that, his teachers explained. He could see part of this from the Keep. Forests of conifers and other trees surrounded them here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill covertly watching the two Reverend Mothers, Duncan did a series of cartwheels. He flexed his striking muscles as he moved, just the way Teg had taught him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg also instructed in planetary defenses. Gammu was ringed by orbiting monitors whose crews could not have their families aboard. The families remained down here on Gammu, hostage to the vigilance of those guardian orbiters. Somewhere among the ships in space, there were undetectable no-ships whose crews were composed entirely of the Bashar\u0027s people and Bene Gesserit Sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would not have taken this assignment without full charge of all defensive arrangements,\" Teg explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan realized that he was \"this assignment.\" The Keep was here to protect him. Teg\u0027s orbiting monitors, including the no-ships, protected the Keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all part of a military education whose elements Duncan found somehow familiar. Learning how to defend a seemingly vulnerable planet from attacks originating in space, he knew when those defenses were correctly placed. It was extremely complicated as a whole but the elements were identifiable and could be understood. There was, for instance, the constant monitoring of atmosphere and the blood serum of Gammu\u0027s inhabitants. Suk doctors in the pay of the Bene Gesserit were everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diseases are weapons,\" Teg said. \"Our defense against diseases must be finely tuned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrequently, Teg railed against passive defenses. He called them \"the product of a siege mentality long known to create deadly weaknesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came to military instructions from Teg, Duncan listened carefully. Patrin and the library records confirmed that the Mentat Bashar Miles Teg had been a famous military leader for the Bene Gesserit. Patrin often referred to their service together and always Teg was the hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobility is the key to military success,\" Teg said. \"If you\u0027re tied down in forts, even whole-planet forts, you are ultimately vulnerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg did not much care for Gammu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that you already know this place was called Giedi Prime once. The Harkonnens who ruled here taught us a few things. We have a better idea, thanks to them, of how terrifyingly brutal humans can become.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he recalled this, Duncan observed that the two Reverend Mothers watching from the parapet obviously were discussing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I the new one\u0027s assignment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan did not like being watched and he hoped the new one would allow him some time to himself. She did not look like a tough one. Not like Schwangyu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he continued his exercises, Duncan timed them to a private litany: Damn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had hated Schwangyu from the age of nine - four years now. She did not know his hate, he thought. She had probably forgotten all about the incident where his hate had been ignited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely nine and he had managed to slip through the inner guards out into a tunnel that led to one of the pillboxes. Smell of fungus in the tunnel. Dim lights. Dampness. He peered out through the box\u0027s weapons slits before being caught and hustled back into the core of the Keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis escapade occasioned a stern lecture from Schwangyu, a remote and threatening figure whose orders must be obeyed. That was how he still thought of her, although he had since learned about the Bene Gesserit Voice-of-Command, that vocal subtlety which could bend the will of an untrained listener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must be obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have occasioned the disciplining of an entire guard unit,\" Schwangyu said. \"They will be severely punished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been the most terrible part of her lecture. Duncan liked some of the guards and occasionally lured some of them into real play with laughter and tumbling. His prank, sneaking out to the pillbox, had hurt his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan knew what it was to be punished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Schwangyu\u0027s lecture, Duncan ran to his chief instructor of the moment, Reverend Mother Tamalane, another of the wizened old ones with a cool and aloof manner, snowy hair above a narrow face and a leather skin. He demanded of Tamalane to know about the punishment of his guards. Tamalane fell into a surprising pensive mood, her voice like sand rasping against wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Punishments? Well, well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the small teaching room off the larger practice floor where Tamalane went each evening to prepare the next day\u0027s lessons. It was a place of bubble and spool readers and other sophisticated means for information storage and retrieval. Duncan far preferred it to the library but he was not allowed in the teaching room unattended. It was a bright room lighted by many suspensor-buoyed glowglobes. At his intrusion, Tamalane turned away from where she laid out his lessons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always something of a sacrificial banquet about our major punishments,\" she said. \"The guards will, of course, receive major punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Banquet?\" Duncan was puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane swung completely around in her swivel seat and looked directly into his eyes. Her steely teeth glittered in the bright lights. \"History has seldom been good to those who must be punished,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan flinched at the word \"history.\" It was one of Tamalane\u0027s signals. She was going to teach a lesson, another boring lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bene Gesserit punishments cannot be forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan focused on Tamalane\u0027s old mouth, sensing abruptly that she spoke out of painful personal experience. He was going to learn something interesting!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our punishments carry an inescapable lesson,\" Tamalane said. \"It is much more than the pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan sat on the floor at her feet. From this angle, Tamalane was a black-shrouded and ominous figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do not punish with the ultimate agony,\" she said. \"That is reserved for a Reverend Mother\u0027s passage through the spice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan nodded. Library records referred to \"spice agony,\" a mysterious trial that created a Reverend Mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Major punishments are painful, nonetheless,\" she said. \"They are also emotionally painful. Emotion evoked by punishment is always that emotion we judge to be the penitent\u0027s greatest weakness and thus we strengthen the punished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words filled Duncan with unfocused dread. What were they doing to his guards? He could not speak but there was no need. Tamalane was not finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The punishment always ends with a dessert,\" she said and she clapped her hands against her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan frowned. Dessert? That was part of a banquet. How could a banquet be punishment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not really a banquet but the idea of a banquet,\" Tamalane said. One clawlike hand described a circle in the air. \"The dessert comes something totally unexpected. The penitent thinks: Ahhh, I have been forgiven at last! You understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shook his head from side to side. No, he did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the sweetness of the moment,\" she said. \"You have been through every course of a painful banquet and come out at the end to something you can savor. But! As you savor it, then comes the most painful moment of all, the recognition, the understanding that this is not pleasure-at-the-end. No, indeed. This is the ultimate pain of the major punishment. It locks in the Bene Gesserit lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what will she do to those guards?\" The words were wrenched from Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot say what the specific elements of the individual punishments will be. I have no need to know. I can only tell you it will be different for each of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane would say no more. She returned to laying out the next day\u0027s lessons. \"We will continue tomorrow,\" she said, \"teaching you to identify the sources of the various accents of spoken Galach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else, not even Teg or Patrin, would answer his questions about the punishments. Even the guards, when he saw them afterward, refused to speak of their ordeals. Some reacted curtly to his overtures and none would play with him anymore. There was no forgiveness among the punished. That much was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was where his deep hatred of her began. All of the old witches shared in his hatred. Would the new young one be the same as the old ones?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn Schwangyu!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he demanded of Schwangyu: \"Why did you have to punish them?\" Schwangyu took some time before answering, then: \"It is dangerous for you here on Gammu. There are people who wish you harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan did not ask why. This was another area where his questions were never answered. Not even Teg would answer, although Teg\u0027s very presence emphasized the fact of that danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Miles Teg was a Mentat who must know many answers. Duncan often saw the old man\u0027s eyes glisten while his thoughts went far away. But there was no Mentat response to such questions as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we here on Gammu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you guard against? Who wants to harm me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are my parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence greeted such questions or sometimes Teg would growl: \"I cannot answer you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe library was useless. He had discovered this when he was only eight and his chief instructor was a failed Reverend Mother named Luran Geasa - not quite as ancient as Schwangyu but well along in years, more than a hundred, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his demand, the library produced information about Gammu/Giedi Prime, about the Harkonnens and their fall, about various conflicts where Teg had commanded. None of those battles came through as very bloody; several commentators referred to Teg\u0027s \"superb diplomacy.\" But, one datum leading to another, Duncan learned about the time of the God Emperor and the taming of his people. This period commanded Duncan\u0027s attention for weeks. He found an old map in the records and projected it on the focus wall. The commentator\u0027s superimpositions told him that this very Keep had been a Fish Speaker Command Center abandoned during the Scattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFish Speakers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan wished then that he had lived during their time, serving as one of the rare male advisors in the female army that had worshiped the great God Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, to have lived on Rakis in those days!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg was surprisingly forthcoming about the God Emperor, calling him always \"the Tyrant.\" A library lock was opened and information about Rakis came pouring out for Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I ever see Rakis?\" he asked Geasa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are being prepared to live there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer astonished him. Everything they taught him about that faraway planet came into new focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why will I live there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot answer that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith renewed interest, he returned to his studies of that mysterious planet and its miserable Church of Shai-hulud, the Divided God. Worms. The God Emperor had become those worms! The idea filled Duncan with awe. Perhaps here was something worthy of worship. The thought touched a chord in him. What had driven a man to accept that terrible metamorphosis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan knew what his guards and the others in the Keep thought about Rakis and the core of priesthood there. Sneering remarks and laughter told it all. Teg said: \"We\u0027ll probably never know the whole truth of it, but I tell you, lad, that\u0027s no religion for a soldier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwangyu capped it: \"You are to learn about the Tyrant but you are not to believe in his religion. That is beneath you, contemptible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn every spare study moment Duncan pored over whatever the library produced for him: the Holy Book of the Divided God, the Guard Bible, the Orange Catholic Bible and even the Apocrypha. He learned about the long defunct Bureau of the Faith and \"The Pearl that IS the Sun of Understanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very idea of the worms fascinated him. Their size! A big one would stretch from one end of the Keep to the other. Men had ridden the pre-Tyrant worms but the Rakian priesthood forbade this now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself gripped by accounts from the archeological team that had found the Tyrant\u0027s primitive no-chamber on Rakis. Dar-es-Balat, the place was called. The reports by Archeologist Hadi Benotto were marked \"Suppressed by orders of the Rakian Priesthood.\" The file number on the accounts from Bene Gesserit Archives was a long one and what Benotto revealed was fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A kernel of the God Emperor\u0027s awareness in each worm?\" he asked Geasa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s said. And even if true, they are not conscious, not aware. The Tyrant himself said he would enter an endless dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach study session occasioned a special lecture and Bene Gesserit explanations of religion until finally he encountered those accounts called \"The Nine Daughters of Siona\" and \"The Thousand Sons of Idaho.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfronting Geasa, he demanded: \"My name is Duncan Idaho, too. What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeasa always moved as though standing in the shadow of her failure, her long head bent forward and her watery eyes aimed at the ground. The confrontation occurred near evening in the long hall outside the practice floor. She paled at his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she did not answer, he demanded: \"Am I descended from Duncan Idaho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must ask Schwangyu.\" Geasa sounded as though the words pained her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a familiar response and it angered him. She meant he would be told something to shut him up, little information in the telling. Schwangyu, however, was more open than expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You carry the authentic blood of Duncan Idaho.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are my parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are long dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know. We received you as an orphan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do people want to harm me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They fear what you may do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it I may do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Study your lessons. All will be made clear to you in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up and study! Another familiar answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed because he had learned to recognize when the doors were closed on him. But now his questing intelligence met other accounts of the Famine Times and the Scattering, the no-chambers and no-ships that could not be traced, not even by the most powerful prescient minds in their universe. Here, he encountered the fact that descendants of Duncan Idaho and Siona, those ancients who had served the Tyrant God Emperor, also were invisible to prophets and prescients. Not even a Guild Steersman deep in melange trance could detect such people. Siona, the accounts told him, was a true-bred Atreides and Duncan Idaho was a ghola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhola?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probed the library for elaborations on this peculiar word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhola. The library produced for him no more than bare-boned accounts: \"Gholas: humans grown from a cadaver\u0027s cells in Tleilaxu axlotl tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAxlotl tanks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Tleilaxu device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe a ghola,\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Innocent flesh devoid of its original memories. See Axlotl Tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan had learned to read the silences, the blank places in what the people of the Keep revealed to him. Revelation swept over him. He knew! Only ten and he knew!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a ghola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate afternoon in the library, all of the esoteric machinery around him faded into a sensory background, and a ten-year-old sat silently before a scanner hugging the knowledge to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a ghola!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not remember the axlotl tanks where his cells had grown into an infant. His first memories were of Geasa picking him up from his cradle, the alert interest in those adult eyes that had so soon faded into wary lidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though the information so grudgingly supplied him by the Keep\u0027s people and records had at last defined a central shape: himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the Bene Tleilax,\" he demanded of the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are a people self-divided into Face Dancers and Masters. Face Dancers are mules, sterile and submissive to the Masters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did they do this to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe information machines of the library were suddenly alien and dangerous. He was afraid, not that his questions might meet more blank walls, but that he would receive answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy am I so important to Schwangyu and the others?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt that they had wronged him, even Miles Teg and Patrin. Why was it right to take the cells of a human and produce a ghola?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked the next question with great hesitation. \"Can a ghola ever remember who he was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The psychological identity of ghola to original pre-sets certain responses, which can be ignited by trauma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer at all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwangyu intruded at this point, arriving at the library unannounced. So something about his questions had been set to alert her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All will be made clear to you in time,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe talked down to him! He sensed the injustice in it, the lack of truthfulness. Something within him said he carried more human wisdom in his unawakened self than the ones who presumed themselves so superior. His hatred of Schwangyu reached a new intensity. She was the personification of all who tantalized him and frustrated his questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, though, his imagination was on fire. He would recapture his original memories! He felt the truth of this. He would remember his parents, his family, his friends... his enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe demanded it of Schwangyu: \"Did you produce me because of my enemies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have already learned silence, child,\" she said. \"Rely on that knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery well. That\u0027s how I will fight you, damned Schwangyu. I will be silent and I will learn. I won\u0027t show you how I really feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she said, \"I think we\u0027re raising a stoic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patronized him! He would not be patronized. He would fight them all with silence and watchfulness. Duncan ran from the library and huddled in his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the following months, many things confirmed that he was a ghola. Even a child knew when things around him were extraordinary. He saw other children occasionally beyond the walls, walking along the perimeter road, laughing and calling. He found accounts of children in the library. Adults did not come to those children and engage them in rigorous training of the sort imposed on him. Other children did not have a Reverend Mother Schwangyu to order every smallest aspect of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis discovery precipitated another change in Duncan\u0027s life. Luran Geasa was called away from him and did not return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not supposed to let me know about gholas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was somewhat more complex, as Schwangyu explained to Lucilla on the observation parapet the day of Lucilla\u0027s arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We knew the inevitable moment would come. He would learn about gholas and ask the pointed questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was high time a Reverend Mother took over his everyday education. Geasa may have been a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you questioning my judgment?\" Schwangyu snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your judgment so perfect that it may never be questioned?\" In Lucilla\u0027s soft contralto, the question had the impact of a slap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwangyu remained silent for almost a minute. Presently, she said: \"Geasa thought the ghola was an endearing child. She cried and said she would miss him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t she warned about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geasa did not have our training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you replaced her with Tamalane at that time. I do not know Tamalane but I presume she is quite old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was his reaction to the removal of Geasa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked where she had gone. We did not answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did Tamalane fare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On his third day with her, he told her very calmly: I hate you. Is that what I\u0027m supposed to do?\"\u0027 \"So quickly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, he\u0027s watching you and thinking: I hate Schwangyu. Will I have to hate this new one? But he is also thinking that you are not like the other old witches. You\u0027re young. He will know that this must be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans live best when each has his place to stand, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things and what he may achieve. Destroy the place and you destroy the person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Bene Gesserit Teaching\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles Teg had not wanted the Gammu assignment. Weapons master to a ghola-child? Even such a ghola-child as this one, with all of the history woven around him. It was an unwanted intrusion into Teg\u0027s well-ordered retirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had lived all of that life as a Military Mentat under the will of the Bene Gesserit and could not compute an act of disobedience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuis custodiet ipsos custodiet? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-2.html","bookId":2157,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:23 PM"}
