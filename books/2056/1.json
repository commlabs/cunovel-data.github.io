{"id":110244,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003eI wished the guy on top of me would hurry up because I was getting bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it didn\u0027t seem like he was going to finish anytime soon. Brad or Brian or whatever his name was thrust away, eyes squeezed shut with such concentration that you would have thought having sex was on par with brain surgery or lifting steel beams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brett,\" I panted. It was time to pull out the big guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened one eye. \"Bryce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryce.\" I put on my most passionate, orgasmic face. \"Please...please...don\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis other eye opened. Both went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, it was all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he gasped, rolling off me. He looked mortified. \"I don\u0027t know...didn\u0027t mean...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, baby.\" I felt only a little bad about using the don\u0027t stop trick on him. It didn\u0027t always work, but for some guys, planting that seed completely undid them. \"It was amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd really, that wasn\u0027t entirely a lie. The sex itself had been mediocre, but the rush afterward...the feel of his life and his soul pouring into me...yeah. That was pretty amazing. It was what a succubus like me literally lived for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a weary smile. The energy he\u0027d had now flowed in my body. Its loss had exhausted him, burned him out. He\u0027d sleep soon and would probably continue sleeping a great deal over the next few days. His soul had been a good one, and I\u0027d taken a lot of it - as well as his life itself. He\u0027d now live a few years less, thanks to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to think about that as I hurriedly put on my clothes. Instead, I focused on how I\u0027d done what I had to do for my own survival. Plus, my infernal masters required me to seduce and corrupt good souls on a regular basis. Bad men might make me feel less guilty, but they didn\u0027t fulfill Hell\u0027s quota.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryce seemed surprised at my abrupt departure but was too worn out to fight it. I promised to call him - having no intention of doing so - and slipped out of the room as he lapsed into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d barely cleared his front door before shape-shifting. I\u0027d come to him as a tall, sable-haired woman but now once again wore my preferred shape, petite with hazel-green eyes and light brown hair that flirted with gold. Like most of my life, my features danced between states, never entirely settling on one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put Bryce out of my mind, just like I did with most men I slept with, and drove across town to what was rapidly becoming my second home. It was a tan, stucco condo, set into a community of other condos that tried desperately to be as hip as new construction in Seattle could manage. I parked my Passat out front, fished my key out of my purse, and let myself inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe condo was still and quiet, wrapped in darkness. A nearby clock informed me it was three in the morning. Walking toward the bedroom, I shape-shifted again, swapping my clothes for a red nightgown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze in the bedroom\u0027s doorway, surprised to feel my breath catch in my throat. You\u0027d think after all this time, I would have gotten used to him, that he wouldn\u0027t affect me like this. But he did. Every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth lay sprawled on the bed, one arm tossed over his head. His breathing came deep and fitful, and the sheets lay in a tangle around his long, lean body. Moonlight muted out the color of his hair, but in the sun, its light brown would pick up a russet glow. Seeing him, studying him, I felt my heart swell in my chest. I\u0027d never expected to feel this way about anyone again, not after centuries of feeling so...empty. Bryce had meant nothing to me, but this man before me meant everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid into bed beside him, and his arms instantly went around me. I think it was instinctual. The connection between us was so deep that even while unconscious, we couldn\u0027t stay away from each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my cheek to Seth\u0027s chest, and his skin warmed mine as I fell asleep. The guilt from Bryce faded, and soon, there was only Seth and my love for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped almost immediately into a dream. Except, well, I wasn\u0027t actually in it, at least not in the active sense. I was watching myself, seeing the events unfold as though at a movie. Only, unlike a movie, I could feel every detail. The sights, the sounds...it was almost more vivid than real life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Georgina was in a kitchen, one I didn\u0027t recognize. It was bright and modern, far larger than anything I could imagine a non-cook like me needing. My dream-self stood at the sink, arms elbow-deep in sudsy water that smelled like oranges. She was hand-washing dishes, which surprised my real-self - but was doing a shoddy job, which did not surprise me. On the floor, an actual dishwasher lay in pieces, thus explaining the need for manual labor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom another room, the sounds of \"Sweet Home Alabama\" carried to my ears. My dream-self hummed along as she washed, and in that surreal, dream sort of way, I could feel her happiness. She was content, filled with a joy so utterly perfect, I could barely comprehend it. Even with Seth, I\u0027d rarely ever felt so happy - and I was pretty damned happy with him. I couldn\u0027t imagine what could make my dream-self feel this way, particularly while doing something as mundane as washing dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, it was full morning, bright and sunny. I\u0027d had no sense of time passing. The dream had seemed to last only a minute, yet the nearby alarm clock claimed six hours had passed. The loss of the happiness my dream-self had experienced made me ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeirder than that, I felt...not right. It took me a moment to peg the problem: I was drained. The life energy I needed to survive, the energy I\u0027d stolen from Bryce, was almost gone. In fact, I had less now than I\u0027d had before going to bed with him. It made no sense. A burst of life like that should have lasted a couple weeks at least, yet I was nearly as wiped out as he\u0027d been. I wasn\u0027t low enough to start losing my shape-shifting ability, but I\u0027d need a new fix within a couple of days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s sleepy voice came from beside me. I rolled over and found him propped on one elbow, watching me with a small, sweet smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to explain what had happened. Doing so would mean elaborating on what I\u0027d done with Bryce, and while Seth theoretically knew what I did to survive, ignorance really was bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I lied. I was a good liar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my cheek. \"I missed you last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you didn\u0027t. You were busy with Cady and O\u0027Neill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile turned wry, but even as it did, I could see his eyes start to take on the dreamy, inward look he got when he thought about the characters in his novels. I\u0027d made kings and generals beg for my love in my long life, yet some days, even my charms couldn\u0027t compete with the people who lived in Seth\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, today wasn\u0027t one of those days, and his attention focused back on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. They don\u0027t look as good in a nightgown. That\u0027s very Anne Sexton, by the way. Like \u0027candy store cinnamon hearts.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Seth would use a bipolar poet as a compliment. I glanced down and ran an absentminded hand over the red silk. \"This does look pretty good,\" I admitted. \"I might look better in this than I do naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffed. \"No, Thetis. You do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, as I always did, when he used the pet name he coined for me. In Greek mythology, Thetis had been Achilles\u0027 mother, a shape-shifting goddess won by a determined mortal. And then, in what was an astonishingly aggressive move for him, Seth flipped me onto my back and began kissing my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, putting up a half-hearted struggle. \"We don\u0027t have time for this. I have stuff to do. And I want breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noted,\" he mumbled, moving on to my mouth. I stopped my complaining. Seth was a wonderful kisser. He gave the kind of kisses that melted into your mouth and filled you with sweetness. They were like cotton candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no real melting to be had, not for us. With a well-practiced sense of timing that you could probably set a watch to, he pulled away from the kiss and sat up, removing his hands as well. Still smiling, he looked down at me and my undignified sprawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back, squelching the small pang of regret that always came at these moments of retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was the way it was with us, and honestly, we had a pretty good system going when one considered all the complications in our relationship. My friend Hugh once had joked that all women steal men\u0027s souls if they\u0027re together long enough. In my case, it didn\u0027t taken years of bickering. A too-long kiss would suffice. Such was the life of a succubus. I didn\u0027t make the rules, and I had no way to stop the involuntary energy theft that came from intimate physical contact. I could, however, control whether that physical contact happened in the first place, and I made sure it didn\u0027t. I ached for Seth, but I wouldn\u0027t steal his life as I had Bryce\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat as well, ready to get up, but Seth must have been feeling bold this morning. He wrapped his arms around my waist and shifted me onto his lap, pressing himself against my back so that his lightly stubbled face buried itself in my neck and hair. I felt his body tremble with the intake of a heavy, deep breath. He exhaled it just as slowly, like he sought control of himself, and then strengthened his grip on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina,\" he breathed against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, and the playfulness was gone. A dark intensity wrapped around us, one that burned with both desire and a fear of what might come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina,\" he repeated. His voice was low, husky. I felt like melting again. \"Do you know why they say succubi visit men in their sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" My own voice was small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I dream about you every night.\" In most circumstances, that would have sounded trite, but from him, it was powerful and hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my eyes tighter as a swirl of emotions danced within me. I wanted to cry. I wanted to make love to him. I wanted to scream. It was all too much sometimes. Too much emotion. Too much danger. Too much, too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my eyes, I shifted so that I could see his face. We held each other\u0027s gazes, both of us wanting more and unable to give or take it. Breaking the look first, I slipped regretfully from his embrace. \"Come on. Let\u0027s go eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth lived in Seattle\u0027s university district - the U-district to locals - and was within easy walking distance to assorted shops and restaurants that lay adjacent to the University of Washington\u0027s campus. We found breakfast at a small caf¨¦, and omelets and conversation soon banished the earlier awkwardness. Afterward, we wandered idly up University Way, holding hands. I had errands to run, and he had writing to do, yet we were reluctant to part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth suddenly stopped walking. \"Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows rose as he stared off at something across the street. \"John Cusack is standing over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his incredulous gaze to where a man very like Mr. Cusack did indeed stand, smoking a cigarette as he leaned against a building. I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not John Cusack. That\u0027s Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. I told you he looked like John Cusack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keyword: looked. That guy doesn\u0027t look like him. That guy is him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, he\u0027s not.\" Seeing Jerome\u0027s impatient expression, I let go of Seth\u0027s hand. \"Be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the street, and as the distance closed between my boss and me, Jerome\u0027s aura washed over my body. All immortals have a unique signature, and a demon like Jerome had an especially strong one. He felt like waves and waves of roiling heat - like when you open an oven and don\u0027t stand far enough back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it fast,\" I told him. \"You\u0027re ruining my romantic interlude. Like usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome dropped the cigarette and put it out with his black Kenneth Cole oxford. He glanced disdainfully around. \"What, here? Come on, Georgie. This isn\u0027t romantic. This place isn\u0027t even a pit stop on the road to romance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put an angry hand on one hip. Whenever Jerome interrupted my personal life, it usually heralded a series of mishaps I\u0027d never wanted to be involved in. Something told me this was no exception. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got a meeting tonight. An all staff meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say \u0027all staff\u0027, do you mean like all staff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time Seattle\u0027s supervising archdemon had gathered everyone in the area together, it had been to inform us that our local imp wasn\u0027t \"meeting expectations.\" Jerome had let us all tell the imp good-bye and then banished the poor guy off to the fiery depths of Hell. It was kind of sad, but then my friend Hugh had replaced him, so I\u0027d gotten over it. I hoped this meeting wouldn\u0027t have a similar purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me an annoyed look, one that said I was clearly wasting his time. \"That\u0027s the definition of all staff, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven. At Peter and Cody\u0027s. Don\u0027t be late. Your presence is essential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. I hoped this wasn\u0027t actually my going away party. I\u0027d been on pretty good behavior lately. \"What\u0027s this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find out when you get there. Don\u0027t be late,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping off the main thoroughfare and into the shadow of a building, the demon vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of dread spread through me. Demons were never to be trusted, particularly when they looked like quirky movie stars and issued enigmatic invitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything okay?\" Seth asked me when I rejoined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered. \"In as much as it ever is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wisely chose not to pursue the subject, and he and I eventually separated to take care of our respective tasks. I was dying to know what this meeting could be about but not nearly as much as I wanted to know what had made me lose my energy overnight. And as I ran my errands - groceries, oil change, Macy\u0027s - I also found the strange, brief dream replaying in my head. How could such a short dream have been so vivid? And why couldn\u0027t I stop thinking about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puzzle distracted me so much that seven rolled around without me knowing it. Groaning, I headed off for my friend Peter\u0027s place, speeding the whole way. Great. I was going to be late. Even if this meeting didn\u0027t concern me and my impending unemployment, I might end up getting a taste of Jerome\u0027s wrath after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout six feet from the apartment door, I felt the hum of immortal signatures. A lot of them. My friends\u0027 auras, familiar and beloved, sang to me instantly. A few others gave me pause as I tried to remember who they belonged to; the greater Puget Sound area had a host of hellish employees that I almost never interacted with. One signature I didn\u0027t recognize at all. And one...one seemed almost familiar. I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on who it belonged to, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to knock, decided an all staff meeting deserved more than jeans and a T-shirt, and shape-shifted my outfit into a brown dress with a low-cut, surplice top. My hair settled into a neat bun. I raised my hand to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn annoyed vampire I barely remembered let me in. She inclined her chin to me by way of greeting and then continued her conversation with another vampire I\u0027d only met once. I think they worked out of Tacoma, which as I far as I was concerned might as well be annexed to Hell itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friend Hugh, dark-haired with a large frame, paced around while chatting animatedly on his cell phone. Jerome lounged in an armchair with a martini. His little-seen lieutenant demonesses stood in a corner, keeping to themselves as always. Peter and Cody - my good friends and the vampires who lived here - laughed about something in the kitchen with a few other hellish employees I only distantly knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could have been an ordinary cocktail party, almost a celebration. I hoped that meant no smiting tonight since that would have really put a damper on the atmosphere. No one had noticed my arrival except for Jerome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten minutes late,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s a fashionable - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words were cut off as a tall, Amazonian blonde nearly barreled into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! You must be Georgina! I\u0027ve been dying to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my eyes past spandex-clad double-D breasts and up into big blue eyes with impossibly long lashes. A huge set of beauty pageant teeth smiled down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy moments of speechlessness were few, but they did happen. This walking Barbie doll was a succubus. A really new one. So shiny and new, in fact, it was a wonder she didn\u0027t squeak. I recognized her age both from her signature and her appearance. No succubus with any sense would have shape-shifted into that. She was trying too hard, haphazardly piling together an assortment of pseudo male-fantasy body parts. It left her with a Frankensteinian creation that was both jaw-dropping and probably anatomically impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnaware of my astonishment and disdain, she took my hand and nearly broke it in a mammoth handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait to work with you,\" she continued. \"I am so ready to make men everywhere suffer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally found my voice. \"Who...who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s your new best friend,\" a voice nearby said. \"My, my look at you. Tawny\u0027s going to have a tough standard to keep up with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man elbowed his way toward us, and whatever curiosity I\u0027d felt in the other succubus\u0027 presence disappeared like ashes in the wind. I forgot she was even there. My stomach twisted into knots as I ID\u0027d the mystery signature. Cold sweat broke out along the back of my neck and seeped into the delicate fabric of the dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy approaching was about as tall as me - which wasn\u0027t tall - and had a dark, olive-toned complexion. There was more pomade on his head than black hair. His suit was nice - definitely not off the rack. A thin-lipped smile spread over his face at my dumbstruck discomfiture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little Letha, all grown up and out to play with the adults, eh?\" He spoke low, voice pitched for my ears alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the grand scheme of things, immortals like me had little to fear in this world. There were, however, three people I feared immensely. One of them was Lilith the Succubus Queen, a being of such formidable power and beauty that I would have sold my soul - again - for one kiss. Someone else who scared me was a nephilim named Roman. He was Jerome\u0027s half-human son and had good reason to want to hunt me down and destroy me some day. The third person who filled me with fear was this man standing before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Niphon, and he was an imp, just like my friend Hugh. And, like all imps, Niphon really only had two jobs. One was to run administrative errands for demons. The other, his primary one, was to make contracts with mortals, brokering and buying souls for Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was the imp who had bought mine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-1.html","bookId":2056,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:56:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:56:54 PM"}
