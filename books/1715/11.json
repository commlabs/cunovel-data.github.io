They all got up and went to the portholes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmunds was outside with the video camera. They could hardly see her through the dense clouds of jellyfish. The jellyfish were small, the size of a thimble, and a delicate, glowing pink. It was indeed like a snowfall. Some of the jellyfish came quite close to the porthole; they could see them well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have no tentacles,\" Harry said. \"They\u0027re just little pulsating sacs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how they move,\" Beth said. \"Muscular contractions expel the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like squid,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as developed, but the general idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re sticky,\" Edmunds said, over the intercom. \"They\u0027re sticking to my suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That pink color is fantastic,\" Ted said. \"Like snow in a sunset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very poetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re sticking to my faceplate, too,\" Edmunds said. \"I have to pull them off.

He was vaguely aware of a dark shape, moving arms, agitated. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the intercom, she said, \"The smear on the faceplate - it won\u0027t go away - they seem to be eroding the plastic - and my arms - the fabric is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina\u0027s voice said, \"Jane.

She coughed, gasped. \"I can\u0027t - I can\u0027t - oh God - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmunds began to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scream was high-pitched and continuous except for ragged gasps for breath. They could no longer see her through the swarms of jellyfish. They looked at each other, at Barnes. Barnes\u0027s face was rigidly set, his jaw tight, listening to the screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, abruptly, there was silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE NEXT MESSAGES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, the jellyfish disappeared as mysteriously as they had come. They could see Edmunds\u0027s body outside the habitat, lying on the bottom, rocking back and forth gently in the current. There were small ragged holes in the fabric of the suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched through the portholes as Barnes and the chief petty officer, Teeny Fletcher, crossed the bottom into the harsh floodlights, carrying extra air tanks. They lifted Edmunds\u0027s body; the helmeted head flopped loosely back, revealing the scarred plastic faceplate, dull in the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke. Norman noticed that even Harry had dropped his manic effect; he sat unmoving, staring out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Barnes and Fletcher still held the body. There was a great burst of silvery bubbles, which rose swiftly to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re they doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inflating her suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?

They didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there were many thin streams of bubbles rising from the holes in the suit, toward the surface. Edmunds\u0027s suit was puffed, bloated. Barnes released it, and it floated slowly away, as if pulled upward by the streaming silver bubbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll go to the surface?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.

Barnes and Fletcher still watched the body, helmets tilted up toward the surface. Fletcher made the sign of the cross. Then they trudged back toward the habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bell rang from somewhere inside. Tina went into D Cyl. Moments later she shouted, \"Dr. Adams! More numbers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry got up and went into the next cylinder. The others trailed after him.

Show him an ordinary Sony color-television set and he\u0027d run screaming, claiming it was witchcraft. He wouldn\u0027t understand it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the point,\" Ted said, \"is that you couldn\u0027t explain it to him, either. At least not easily. Isaac Newton wouldn\u0027t be able to understand TV without first studying our physics for a couple of years. He\u0027d have to learn all the underlying concepts: electromagnetism, waves, particle physics. These would all be new ideas to him, a new conception of nature. In the meantime, the TV would be magic as far as he was concerned. But to us it\u0027s ordinary. It\u0027s TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying we\u0027re like Isaac Newton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed shrugged. \"We\u0027re getting a communication and we don\u0027t know how it\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we shouldn\u0027t bother to try and find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we have to accept the possibility,\" Ted said, \"that we may not be able to understand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman noticed the energy with which they threw themselves into this discussion, pushing aside the tragedy so recently witnessed. They\u0027re intellectuals, he thought, and their characteristic defense is intellectualization. Talk. Ideas. Abstractions. Concepts. It was a way of getting distance from the feelings of sadness and fear and being trapped. Norman understood the impulse: he wanted to get away from those feelings himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry frowned at the spiral image. \"We may not understand how, but it\u0027s obvious what it\u0027s doing. It\u0027s trying to communicate by trying different presentations. The fact that it\u0027s trying spirals may be significant. Maybe it believes we think in spirals. Or write in spirals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Beth said. \"Who knows what kind of weird creatures we are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed said, \"If it\u0027s trying to communicate with us, why aren\u0027t we trying to communicate back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry snapped his fingers. \"Good idea!\" He went to the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s an obvious first step,\" Harry said. \"We just send the original message back. We\u0027ll start with the first grouping, beginning with the double zeroes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want it made clear,\" Ted said, \"that the suggestion to attempt communication with the alien originated with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s clear, Ted,\" Barnes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry?\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Ted,\" Harry said. \"Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s your idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting at the keyboard, Harry typed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e00032125252632\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe numbers appeared on the screen. There was a pause. They listened to the hum of the air fans, the distant thump of the diesel generator. They all watched the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen went blank, and then printed out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0001132121051808012232\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just a series of numbers on a computer screen, but it still gave him a chill. Standing beside him, Tina shivered. \"He answered us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fabulous,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try the second grouping now,\" Harry said. He seemed calm, but his fingers kept making mistakes at the keyboard. It took a few moments before he was able to type:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e032629\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reply immediately came back:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0015260805180810213\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Harry said, \"looks like we just opened our line of communication.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Beth said. \"Too bad we don\u0027t understand what we\u0027re saying to each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Presumably it knows what it\u0027s saying,\" Ted said. \"But we\u0027re still in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we can get it to explain itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatiently, Barnes said, \"What is this it you keep referring to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sighed, and pushed his glasses up on his nose. \"I think there\u0027s no doubt about that. It,\" Harry said, \"is something that was previously inside the sphere, and that is now released, and is free to act. That\u0027s what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE MONSTER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALARM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman awoke to a shrieking alarm and flashing red lights. He rolled out of his bunk, pulled on his insulated shoes and his heated jacket, and ran for the door, where he collided with Beth. The alarm was screaming throughout the habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening!\" he shouted, over the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was pale, frightened. Norman pushed past her. In the B Cylinder, among all the pipes and consoles, a flashing sign winked: \"LIFE SUPPORT EMERGENCY.\" He looked for Teeny Fletcher, but the big engineer wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried back toward C Cylinder, passing Beth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know?\" Beth shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s life support! Where\u0027s Fletcher? Where\u0027s Barnes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know! I\u0027m looking!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nobody in B!\" he shouted, and scrambled up the steps into D Cylinder. Tina and Fletcher were there, working behind the computer consoles. The back panels were pulled off, exposing wires, banks of chips. The room lights were flashing red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screens all flashed \"EMERGENCY - LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Norman shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher waved a hand dismissingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, saw Harry sitting in the corner near Edmunds\u0027s video section like a zombie, with a pencil and a pad of paper on his knee. He seemed completely indifferent to the sirens, the lights flashing on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry didn\u0027t respond; Norman turned back to the two women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, will you tell me what it is?\" Norman shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the sirens stopped. The screens went blank. There was silence, except for soft classical music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that,\" Tina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a false alarm,\" Fletcher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ,\" Norman said, dropping into a chair. He took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you asleep?\" He nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. It just went off by itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The next time it happens, you can check your badge,\" Fletcher said, pointing to the badge on her own chest. \"That\u0027s the first thing to do. You see the badges are all normal now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy, Norman,\" Harry said. \"When the psychiatrist goes crazy, it\u0027s a bad sign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a psychologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina said, \"Our computer alarm has a lot of peripheral sensors, Dr. Johnson. It goes off sometimes. There\u0027s not much we can do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman nodded, went into E Cyl to the galley. Levy had made strawberry shortcake for lunch, and nobody had eaten it because of the accident with Edmunds. He was sure it would still be there, but when he couldn\u0027t find it, he felt frustrated. He opened cabinet doors, slammed them shut. He kicked the refrigerator door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake it easy, he thought. It was just a false alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn\u0027t overcome the feeling that he was trapped, stuck in some damned oversized iron lung, while things slowly fell apart around him. The worst moment had been Barnes\u0027s briefing, when he came back from sending Edmunds\u0027s body to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnes had decided it was time to make a little speech. Deliver a little pep talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re all upset about Edmunds,\" he had said, \"but what happened to her was an accident. Perhaps she made an error of judgment in going out among jellyfish. Perhaps not. The fact is, accidents happen under the best of circumstances, and the deep sea is a particularly unforgiving environment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListening, Norman thought, He\u0027s writing his report. Explaining it away to the brass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now,\" Barnes was saying, \"I urge you all to remain calm. It\u0027s sixteen hours since the gale hit topside. We just sent up a sensor balloon to the surface. Before we could make readings, the cable snapped, which suggests that surface waves are still thirty feet or higher, and the gale is still in full force. The weather satellite estimates were for a sixty-hour storm on site, so we have two more full days down here. There\u0027s not much we can do about it. We just have to remain calm. Don\u0027t forget, even when you do go topside you can\u0027t throw open the hatch and start breathing. You have to spend four more days decompressing in a hyperbaric chamber on the surface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the first Norman had heard of surface decompression. Even after they left this iron lung, they would have to sit in another iron lung for another four days?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you knew,\" Barnes had said. \"That\u0027s SOP for saturated environments. You can stay down here as long as you like, but you have a four-day decompress when you go back. And believe me, this habitat\u0027s a lot nicer than the decompression chamber. So enjoy this while you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy this while you can, he thought. Jesus Christ. Strawberry shortcake would help. Where the hell was Levy, anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to D Cyl. \"Where\u0027s Levy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunno,\" Tina said. \"Around here somewhere. Maybe sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody could sleep through that alarm,\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try the galley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did. Where\u0027s Barnes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went back to the ship with Ted. They\u0027re putting more sensors around the sphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them it was a waste of time,\" Harry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So nobody knows where Levy is?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher finished screwing the computer panels back on. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"are you one of those people who need to keep track of where everyone is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Norman said. \"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the big deal about Levy, sir?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sphere/page-11.html","bookId":1715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:55 AM"}
