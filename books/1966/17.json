He made me into a chick magnet,” Henry says, grinning. “And Ms. Bonner told me that you and I made the highest grade in the whole class. We were excel ent parents.” He nods seriously, and I shove his chest, shaking my head and laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Picture time,” I say, nodding my head at the photographer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts to walk back to the team, but then turns and says, “Your hair looks great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esays, “Your hair looks great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get this over with,” I say to the photographer.

His extra weight flops around as he struts up and down the sideline with his jersey thrown over his shoulder. I breathe deeply, so incredibly relieved that my team wasn’t making fun of me after al .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crack up when JJ cal s out, “I’m ready for my photo op, Jordan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egame #2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundred Oaks High versus Stones River High, our main rival.

It’s the Saturday night after our game versus Stones River and my parents are out of town for my dad’s game in Jacksonvil e on Sunday, so I invited JJ, Carter, and Henry over to hang out, and they freaking showed up with Lacey, Kristen, Marie, Carrie…and Ty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJJ and Carter stuff their hands in the pockets of their jeans and turn to stare at Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys are such great friends,” Henry says. “I can’t believe you threw me under the bus that is Jordan Woods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t cal me a bus!

They can stay. But under no circumstances wil anyone make out on my bed or touch any of my personal possessions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shucks,” JJ says. “I only came ’cause I thought I’d get to fool around on your bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re such an ass,” I say, grabbing a soda from the fridge as Carrie comes into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jordan,” she says, “Do you have any Tylenol? I’ve got a headache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” I reply, gesturing for her to fol ow me upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” Carter asks as he cups her elbow with a hand. “Need a ride home or anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m cool, but thanks,” she says to Carter, grinning as she fol ows me. As soon as we’re in the bathroom and I’m rooting around in the medicine cabinet, Carrie shuts the door and whispers, “I don’t need any Tylenol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted to talk to you alone. What’s going on with Ty?” she squeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jordan, come on.

I feel like I’m on one of those shitty reality shows like The Bachelorette or something. Unknotting my hair, I let it fal down my back. I grab a hairbrush, untangle my hair, and then pul it back up again as I decide what to tel Carrie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, he tried to kiss me last week, and I didn’t let him. What if he never tries again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie’s kind blue eyes shine as she smiles. “He wil .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And, um, if he does, what do I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Carrie asks, raising an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Carrie asks, raising an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI purse my lips, incredibly embarrassed at having to ask. “How do I kiss him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” She pauses. “Wel , sit here,” she says, pul ing the toilet seat down and patting it, tel ing me to sit. I take a seat and look up at Carrie. “Pretend I’m Ty…so when he leans in, just sort of wrap your fingers around his neck like this.” She takes my hand and puts it on the back of her neck. Jesus, this must be the weirdest thing that’s ever happened to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans in as if she’s going to kiss me. “When his lips touch yours, just start touching him everywhere. His back, his jaw, his neck, his cheeks, his hips. Move your hands slowly, but keep him guessing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it,” I say, taking my hand off her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then use lots of lip, not so much tongue.” She kisses the back of her hand, demonstrating for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it,” I say, but skip the part where I make out with my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it?” I exclaim. It seems so much more complicated on TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup, now go get ’em,” she says, sounding just like Coach when he gives us pep talks before games. I’m surprised she doesn’t slap my ass too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie and I walk back into the family room, where I sit down in my dad’s favorite armchair and pop open my Diet Coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love your house, Jordan,” Marie says, looking around. “Thanks so much for inviting us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome,” I reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe I’m getting to see your dad’s Heismans,” she says, gawking at the trophies on the shelf. She walks over and peers up at them. “My dad and brother wil be so jealous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my eyebrows at Henry, who shrugs and smiles. Al right, Marie does seem nice and sweet. Henry sits down on the floor and pul s her onto his lap. He whispers in her ear and kisses her cheek, and she giggles. He seems happy tonight, so that makes me happy. Carrie smiles at them, but I can tel she’s stil hurt. I’m dying to know why they broke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJJ sits with Lacey, and Carter sits with Carrie, probably because she’s the only option left besides Kristen, who’s stil eyeing Ty with a shitload of interest. When Ty picks a seat, I notice he sits as far away from Kristen as possible, but she crawls over next to him anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith everyone else paired off into couples, I feel like a ninth wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who wants a drink?” Lacey asks, pul ing these lame piña colada wine coolers out of her bag and passing them out to the other girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJJ moves to grab one, but I shake my head at him. I don’t care if my team drinks, but they’re not drinking on my watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t you have brought something good?” Carter asks Lacey. “Like a nice Pinot Grigio or a Chianti?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love Pinot Grigio,” Carrie replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hel are you talking about?” I ask Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chianti? How could that possibly compare with a Slurpee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hear, hear,” Marie says, and we grin at each other before she takes a sip of her wine cooler. I laugh when she grimaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTy’s leaning up against a leather sofa with Kristen nestled up next to him. She’s beaming, but he’s staring at his fingernails. Then he peers over at me and I turn away as fast as I can and focus on the clown fish in our tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJJ and Henry are looking at me with eyes wide open, shaking their heads. Carrie whispers something in Carter’s ear, and he starts nodding and laughing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/catching-jordan-hundred-oaks-1/page-17.html","bookId":1966,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:33 AM"}
