The man slowly walked out from the darkness, into the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was also pale, just like Fu Hongxue’s. So white, it was translucent. So white, it was terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were very bright, but they carried an indescribable sort of emptiness and melancholy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big fellow stared at him in shock. He couldn’t help but ask, “If you know he is going to kill you, why did you come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said, “I must come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big fellow said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said, “Because I also want to kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big fellow said, “You must kill him, no matter what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded. “In every person’s life, there are a few things he must do which he doesn’t wish to, because he simply doesn’t have any room for choosing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big fellow looked at him, and then looked at Fu Hongxue. He seemed both surprised and perplexed. This sort of affair was something which a person like him would never understand. But he already felt a murderous aura. The few square feet of this stall seemed to have suddenly become an execution ground. In fact, the killing aura was even stronger, even more fearful than that of the execution ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gaze of the man who walked out from the darkness turned to Fu Hongxue. His gaze became even more melancholic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen without emotion shouldn’t feel this sort of melancholy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu used to be a man without emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly let out a sigh. “You should know that I originally didn’t want to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was still silent. He seemed to have become drunk long ago, numb long ago. Even the hand with which he gripped his sabre seemed to have lost that boulder-like stability it once had. But he still gripped his sabre in his hand, and his sabre had not changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu looked at his sabre. “I believe that sooner or later, there will be a day when I can defeat your sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had said long ago, “I will wait for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “Originally, I wanted to wait until that day came before I sought you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly said, “Then you shouldn’t have come now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “But I am already here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You knew that you shouldn’t have come. Why did you still come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu suddenly chuckled. His chuckle was filled with cynicism. “Haven’t you done things which you know you shouldn’t have done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue closed his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some things which he knew he shouldn’t have done, and yet insisted on doing them. Even he couldn’t control himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese things had a sort of irrestible lure to them to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to that, there were things which you know you should not do, and yet the circumstances force you to do them. Even if you wanted to escape, you could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “I’ve already sought you out three times. All three times, I wanted to kill you, but all three times, you let me go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was silent again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “I know that you never wanted to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly asked, “Do you also know why I don’t want to kill you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “Because it has been a long time since you faced a true match. You, as well, want to wait for that day and see whether or not I can defeat your sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue admitted to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be invincible and unconquerable isn’t as pleasant a thing as some might imagine. When a man reaches the point of being without an equal opponent, he is even more lonely than being without friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “But I know that you will no longer wait anymore. This time, you will definitely kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “Because you are already incapable of controlling yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were dull and empty. He looked just like a dead man, but his smile was still filled with cynicism. “Because you already are no longer the Fu Hongxue of bygone days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, all you are is an executioner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say those words. His dagger had already flown out; fast, accurate, and deadly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he knew that this dagger of his would definitely be defeated by Fu Hongxue, when he struck, he still used all of his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was ‘sincere’. At least, his dagger was ‘sincere’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe significance of the word ‘sincere’ lies in professionalism and precision. The energy to work unflinchingly with perseverance, to not give up any opportunity until the point where all hope is lost, to never abandon the last bit of strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t easy to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnybody who was capable of doing this would be successful at whatever they do. Unfortunately, he no longer had any opportunities left, because he took a path he should not have taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Fu Hongxue had already drawn his sabre!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of sabre light. A human head falling to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh blood sprayed out like a red mist underneath the dim yellow light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light turned red, but his face was still pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the blood in that big fellow’s body had frozen. Even his breathing seemed to have stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also used a sabre. He also killed. But now, he had seen Fu Hongxue’s sabre. Now, he knew that what he used, couldn’t be really be considered a sabre at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe even felt that he himself couldn’t really be considered to have killed someone before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light turned a dim yellow again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head up, and suddenly realized that Fu Hongxue was no longer underneath the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place where there was no light, naturally was the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Originally, I really could have spared him. Why did I still kill him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at the sabre in his hand. He suddenly understood why Xiao Siwu had to come!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he knew that Fu Hongxue could no longer control himself, he believed he had a chance to defeat Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was impatient to give it a try, so he was already unable to wait for that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting was, after all, a very painful thing. He was, after all, still young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s judgement wasn’t wrong. He himself knew that he wasn’t wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of who was wrong, the pressure and burden in his heart had already become incapable of being lightened, because the person he killed was someone which he definitely would not have killed in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can it be that I truly am no longer capable of controlling myself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can it be that I truly have become an executioner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can it be that I will go crazy, sooner or later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a speck of dust alighted on the table. Not a hint of sound was in the room. Gongzi Yu was deep in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Siwu has already gone?” He had just asked that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What method did you use to induce him to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We made him believe that he had a chance to kill Fu Hongxue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the result?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the result was that Fu Hongxue killed him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Siwu was also the first to strike?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu was deep in thought. The person he was pondering was definitely Fu Hongxue. Only Fu Hongxue was worthy of him deeply pondering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from Fu Hongxue, there was no one else who was capable of arousing his interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the window, it was already deep dusk. The scent of flowers quietly blew about in the night wind. He suddenly chuckled. “He is still killing, still taking lives in one sabre. But he’s almost finished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked again, “Do you know why he is almost finished?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t looking at Gu Qi, but rather someone standing behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody would notice this person, because he was simply too silent, too peaceful, too ordinary, just like Gongzi Yu’s shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody would pay attention to his shadow, but this question of Gongzi Yu’s wasn’t directed towards Gu Qi. It was directed to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan it be that Gu Qi was not capable of explaining this, but he was? Could it be that he knew more than even Gu Qi?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When someone is almost finished, they will reveal openings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Openings?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like the openings which appear when a dam bursts.” Although the example he used was very strange, it was simple and correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fu Hongxue already has openings?” Gongzi Yu asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He originally didn’t want to kill Xiao Siwu. He already spared Xiao Siwu three times, but this time he was unable to control himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is his opening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu’s laughter became all the more joyful. “Do we now no longer need to send him people to kill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can send him one more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow used an even queerer expression. “In all the world, the only person who can kill him is Fu Hongxue, and only Fu Hongxue can kill himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was even more ruthless than killing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing someone to kill himself was more ruthless, because the experiences before that are longer and more painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long night. So long, it was frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long night was already almost over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue halted. He looked at the milky white morning fog rise amidst the bamboo and the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally had endured this rather long night. How much longer could he endure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was exhausted. Thirsty. Hungry. His head was about to split. His lips were so chapped, they were splitting as well. He didn’t know where he was right now, much less whose bamboo patch this was, whose flowers these were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had walked for too long. He stopped here only because there was the sound of zither music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty, ghost-like zither music. It seemed to have arisen out of nowhere, just like the morning fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t want to stop here. He didn’t know why he stopped here either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe illusory zither music sounded like a faraway call from a dear one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no dear ones, but he could hear this zither music. His spirit immediately was filled with a strange feeling, and then his entire person merged with the zither music. The bloody affairs of killing suddenly became distant and far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time he felt totally relaxed since he had killed the brother and sister of the Ni family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, with a clanging sound, the zither music ended. From within the small garden, a voice said, “I didn’t expect that there would be a good friend appreciating my music outside. Why don’t you come in and sit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout even thinking, Fu Hongxue pushed the door open and walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small garden was filled with luxurious, beautiful flowers and trees. There are three or five humble sheds, and a white-haired old man wearing a grey garment that had already come out to welcome his guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue actually paid him formal respects. “I am an uninvited guest. How dare I trouble you, old sir, to personally welcome me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man smiled. “It’s easy to find an honored guest, but hard to find a friend who appreciates one’s talents. If I don’t personally welcome you, wouldn’t I be a disrespectful person? In that case, how could I study the zither?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man said, “Please enter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was tall and refined. A zither was on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a classically elegant zither, appearing to be at least a thousand-year old antique. But part of the zither strings had been scorched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s face changed. “Can this be the legendary zither which has been said since antiquity to be the number one zither in the world, the ‘Scorched String’ zither?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man smiled. “Sir, you have a fine eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Then, old sir, would you be Grandmaster Zhong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man said, “This useless old man truly is surnamed Zhong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue bowed deeply yet again. This was the first time he had ever paid such respect to someone. He wasn’t actually paying his respects to this person, but to his unparalleled, best-in-the-world zither skills. A lofty, unique skill with the fine arts; a lofty, unique character. All of these should receive the same respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wooden couch didn’t have a speck of dust on it. Grandmaster Zhong took off his shoes and walked onto the couch, sitting down on his knees. “You sit as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not sit. The blood and filth on his body hadn’t been washed off for a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “Although this useless old man has only one zither and one table in this house, the people who can come in aren’t many.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Fu Hongxue. “Do you know why I invited you in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “Because I can tell that although your clothes are not tidy, your heart and soul are like a bright mirror. Why should you, then, feel a sense of inadequacy or inferiority?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue sat down as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong smiled. He stroked the zither strings with his hand. With a sweet sound, the ghostly zither melody once more seized Fu Hongxue’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still gripping his sabre in his hand, but he suddenly felt as though this sabre was unneeded. This was also the first time he had this feeling. The zither melody seemed to have taken him into an entirely different world, a world without sabres, a world without sin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy must men kill men? Not only did they themselves kill people, they forced others to kill people as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand with which Fu Hongxue gripped his sabre had already loosened. Originally, he really had almost collapsed, but within the zither melody, he freed himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the sound came from far away, it entered the ears clearly. Just at this moment, a clanging sound suddenly came from far away. It also seemed to be a zither melody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand with which Grandmaster Zhong was playing the zither suddenly trembled. All five of the strings suddenly snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s face changed as well. The world suddenly became deathly still. Grandmaster Zhong sat there without moving, seeming totally dejected. He appeared to have suddenly aged ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue couldn’t help but ask, “Grandmaster, did you hear an evil omen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong neither heard nor asked. Zither music came from far away again. Cold sweat actually poured down from his forehead. When the zither melody came again, this noble, elegant, lofty old man suddenly jumped to his feet, then rushed out wearing only a set of white socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gust of wind blew by the door. The broken zither strings danced in the wind, as though the spirit of the zither had come to life and wanted to leave with him and see who was playing the zither from afar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue left with him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zither strings snapped. The man aged. It seemed as though even the flowers in this garden had suddenly turned wan and pallid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the long alley was a long street. At the end of the long street was a marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, it was the morning market. The marketplace was filled with all sorts of people, filled with all sorts of sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people were all common people. The sounds were all common sounds. What did this refined grandmaster Zhong come here to look for? The previously spotless white socks he was wearing was already covered with mud and grime. He stupidly stood there, gazing hither and to, looking as though he were a young housewife who had lost her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would a world-famous zither-god suddenly become like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue originally wasn’t a man of many words, but at this moment, he couldn’t help but ask, “Grandmaster, what are you looking for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong was silent, a strange expression on his face. Only after a long time did he respond, “I am looking for a person, I must find this person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “An incomparably elite person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What area is he an elite in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “Zither.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “His zither skills are higher than your own?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong let out a long sigh. Gloomily, he said, “One sound from him is enough to make me never again dare to touch the zither.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s features couldn’t help but change. “Grandmaster, do you already know where he is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “The zither sound came from here. He should be here as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “This is only a marketplace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong sighed. “It is precisely because this is a marketplace that he is able to display his real abilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong’s gaze was far away, as though he had lost something but also gained something. “Because although he himself is in a vulgar, common place, his heart is far away amongst the clouds. The tens of thousands of vulgar, common things in the world can no longer stir his clear, water-like heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was silent. He slowly raised his head, then suddenly said in a loud voice, “Grandmaster, can he be the person you are speaking of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a butcher’s stall in the marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what type of marketplace it was, there would be a butcher’s stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere there was a butcher’s stall, there would be a butcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll butchers feel themselves to be out of the ordinary, believing themselves to be nobler than the other street peddlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause they can kill. Because they aren’t afraid to bleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis butcher was in the middle of chopping meat. There was a very large butcher’s block next to the meat, and beneath the block there was a man resting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lazy-looking man in white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground was both wet and filthy. Many married women bought vegetables here while wearing spiked shoes. But this person didn’t care. He lazily rested in the middle of the muddy ground. On his knee, there was a zither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be playing the zither, but the zither produced no sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong had already walked over to him. He respectfully stood in front of him, then bowed to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this man was looking at his hand. He didn’t even lift his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong’s expression became even more solemn and respectful. He actually referred to himself as a ‘student’. “This student is named Zhong Li.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white dully said, “Can it be the god of zither music, Grandmaster Zhong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat suddenly emanated from Grandmaster Zhong’s face. He haltingly said, “Noble sir, when you touched the strings of your zither, you shocked and overawed the world. Why have you stopped playing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white said, “I am afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong was astonished. “Afraid? Afraid of what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white said, “I am afraid that you will commit suicide by ramming your head against that ‘Scorched String’ zither of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong’s head sunk. Sweat fell down like rain, but he couldn’t help but ask, “Noble sir, do you come from afar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white said, “I come from afar, but know not where I go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “Dare I ask for your honorable name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white said, “No need to ask me. I’m just a zither-playing servant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zither-playing servant? A man like this would be a zither-playing servant to someone else? Who was worthy of having an apprentice such as this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong couldn’t believe it. This truly was unbelievable for him. He couldn’t help but ask, “Based on your great talent, noble sir, how could you place yourself beneath another?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white dully said, “Because I’ve always been inferior to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly said, “Who is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white chuckled. “Since I know who you are, you should know who he is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue gripped his sabre tightly again. “Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white laughed. “You really do know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly struck out like lightning, seizing his hand. Who would have imagined that Grandmaster Zhong would rush forward and tightly grasp Fu Hongxue’s arm. He loudly shouted, “No matter what, don’t hurt his hands! This is an incomparable national treasure, the hands of a true grandmaster!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white laughed loudly. The butcher chopping the meat suddenly chopped his knife at the crown of Fu Hongxue’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vegetable peddler by the side of the butcher also used a weightbeam as an acupoint sealing device to attack, striking at Fu Hongxue’s ‘Qimen’, ‘Jiangtai’, and ‘Xuanyang’ acupoints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe housewife carrying a vegetable basket also attacked, using the vegetable basket to cover Fu Hongxue’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind, a peddler carrying two chickens on a carrying pole walked over as well. He actually pulled off his pole and used it to strike at Fu Hongxue’s waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a flash of sabre light. With a swishing sound, the pole was shattered, the vegetable basket disintegrated, the weightbeam was cut in half, and a butcher’s knife suddenly flew out, with a bloody hand attached to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chickens and the ducks in the cage flew out. The marketplace became as chaotic as a pot of freshly made gruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in white beneath the chopping board had already disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crowd of people gathered. The butcher, the vegetable peddler, the housewife, and the chicken seller had all disappeared into the crowd. But the zither melody could still be heard from far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue parted the crowd and walked out. Outside of the crowd, there was still more people, but none of the ones he was looking for. However, he had already heard the zither melody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the zither melody was coming from was where he was going. He didn’t walk very quickly. This seemingly entirely imaginary zither melody couldn’t be caught by anyone. What’s the point of walking quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t give up. So long as the zither melody was ahead of him, he would keep walking forward. Grandmaster Zhong actually followed from behind. His snow-white stockings were ruined now. Even his two feet seemed to be ruined. No one knew how long they had been walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun began to rise. They had long since left the market, left the city. The gentle spring wind blew across the lush seedlings in the fields. From far away, the mountains rose and undulated, and the earth was as gentle and warm as a virgin’s chest. They had entered ‘her’ embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were green hills in all directions and water everywhere. The zither melody seemed to come from the deep mountains and the watery depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mountains were now deep, and the flowing water had stilled. There was a small log cabin next to a small lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a zither and a table in the cabin, but nobody there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zither strings still seemed to be quivering, and beneath the zither there was a short letter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre reveals openings, the zither strings snap,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon has fallen, the flowers have withered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young master [Gongzi] is like a dragon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHovering above the nine heavens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe empty hills were silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong faced the faraway mountains. He was silent for a long, long time, before slowly saying, “This really is a good place. Those who don’t want to leave can stay. Those who cannot leave, why leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue looked at him from far away, waiting for him to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong was silent for another long period of time. “I no longer intend to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Do you not wish to go, or are you unable to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong didn’t reply. Instead, he turned to look at him. Facing him, he asked, “How old do you think I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head was filled with white hair, and his face was filled with the marks and scars of having lived an exhausting life. He looked weary and old, older than when Fu Hongxue had first seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered his own question. “I was famous when I was young. This year, I’m only thirty-five years old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue looked at his tired face and his white hair. Although he did not speak, he couldn’t help but appear shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong chuckled. “I know I look very old. I’ve had white hair for many years now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chuckle was filled with agony. “Because I have already exhausted all of my life’s energy. Although I have gained an amount of comfort and fame from the zither which others cannot even imagine, the zither has also swallowed up all of my marrow and my blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue understood his meaning. If a person became totally involved in one thing, it was as though he had made a pact with demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything you want, I will give you. But you must give me everything you have as well, including your life and your soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “Originally, this was a fair trade. I didn’t have any cause for complaint. But now…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Fu Hongxue. “You study the sabre. If you were like me, and had given up everything for your sabre, but then suddenly discovered that someone could defeat you using a single flick of the finger, how would you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue didn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong let out a sigh, then slowly said, “Naturally, you won’t understand this. To you, a sabre is only a sabre. It doesn’t have any other meanings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue wanted to laugh, laugh loudly. But he naturally couldn’t laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sabre is only a sabre? Who could imagine the meaning which this sabre held for him? Hadn’t he also made a pact with demons, hadn’t he also given up everything? What did he get in return?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from him, perhaps there was nobody else in the world who understood this better. But he didn’t speak. His suffering had entered his very bones. He couldn’t even vomit it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong chuckled again. “But no matter what, since we can meet each other, it must be destiny. I want to play another song for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “And then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “And then, if you want to leave, you can leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Won’t you leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandmaster Zhong said, “Leave? Where can I leave to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue finally fully understood his meaning. This was a good place. He had already intended to be buried here. To him, life was no longer a glorious thing. It was shame. He already had no purpose in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a strumming sound, the zither music started again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already dark outside. The darkness was like a fine gauze covering the mountain valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zither melody was mournful, as though an ancient, beautiful white palace was telling a story of the misery of mankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough in life, there would always be joy, it was always just momentary and fleeting. Only tragedy was eternal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA person’s life was a very short thing to begin with. Regardless of who you are, you wouldn’t be able to avoid death eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor what purpose did people live?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy must they struggle and fight? Why must they be miserable and unhappy? Why is death the only eternal, peaceful answer to unanswerable questions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, the zither began to speak of the beauty and peace of death, a beauty and peace which no one could ever describe using words. Only his zither music could express it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he himself had sunk into a beautiful dream of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe death god’s hand seemed to be guiding his in playing the zither, coaxing men to give up everything and be forever peaceful in the dreamlands of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, there was neither pain nor struggles against other men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, not only was there no killing, there was also no men forcing other men to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis definitely was something which no one could resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s hand was already starting to tremble. His clothes had already been soaked with sweat as well. Since life was so tragic, why must a man continue to live?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand with which he gripped his sabre became even tighter. Was he preparing to draw his sabre? Who was he going to kill with the sabre?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only person who can kill him is Fu Hongxue, and only Fu Hongxue can kill himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zither music became even more tragic. The mountain valley became even darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no light. There was no hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zither music seemed to be calling out to him. And he seemed to see Yan Nanfei and Mingyue Xin, their faces filled with smiles and laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they already at peace? Were they advising him to accept that peace and beauty? Fu Hongxue finally drew his sabre!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-19\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-21\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-20","bookId":1505,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM"}
