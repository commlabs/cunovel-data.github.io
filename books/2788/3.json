{"id":89156,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eI CHUCKED MY CELL PHONE into the seat next to me and adjusted the vents, cranking up the car\u0027s air-conditioning to let it blow directly on my heated face. I pulled sharply back into traffic after having pulled over to read Richard\u0027s text. How could that man make me so angry with just 140 characters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was headed into Glenville to drop the kids off for a short visit. Paige and Jordan were in the back discussing whether or not \"poop from the potty went to goldfish heaven,\" and I was in front, sizzling mad at their father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis text had read, \"Running late. Drop kids at office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he was running late. Of course he thought I could drop his children at the office instead of his apartment. It didn\u0027t matter to him that his office was in the thick of downtown Glenville, where traffic was the worst. Or that the red-haired adulteress sat at the front desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated going into the Channel Seven building. Every time I\u0027d been there, I swear his coworkers smirked at me and whispered into their phones. His charm had brainwashed them. They seemed to think his antics had been harmless. Just boyish bad behavior. Certainly nothing to get divorced over. I\u0027d heard they even renamed the copy room after that infamous party. It was now known as the Copulator Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped the steering wheel more tightly and headed into the city. A dozen more harrowing miles and at last I arrived. I parked in the ramp next to the Channel Seven station and called Richard. He could come out to get his children. I was not going in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, beautiful,\" Richard purred into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed my first response. It tasted as nasty as it would have sounded. \"You\u0027re not supposed to call me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but you are so beautiful I can\u0027t help myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try. We\u0027re divorced now, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis snicker was humorless, like a serial killer plotting. \"How could I forget?\" Richard asked. \"I think of it every time I make another huge-ass mortgage payment on a house I\u0027m not allowed inside of. And you\u0027re not living at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should have thought of that before you banged the weather girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused as if he had to think about it. \"I\u0027ve never banged a weather girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a big breath, wishing I could blow away my memory of him with it. \"Anyway, we\u0027re here. Come out and get the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re here? Fantastic! Bring them in.\" Genuine enthusiasm sounded in his voice, softening my anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you come out and get them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of our history of hostility, Richard could still be very persuasive. If I gave him an inch, he\u0027d convince me to cook us dinner and massage his feet faster than I could say, \"Fuck you, you bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m waiting for a phone call. Can\u0027t you please just come in?\" He whined, which meant he was lying. Actually I knew he was lying because he was talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Come and get \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sigh was prom-queen dramatic. \"Oh, fine!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came out the door in minutes, a broad smile on his face for Paige and Jordan. My breath caught when I saw him. He was tan, and his blond hair was the lightest I\u0027ve ever seen it. It made his brown eyes seem even darker, deeper. Those eyes always reminded me of chocolate, another thing I once loved but had given up for my own good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys! Come on! Give your pop a hug!\" He threw his arms out wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI helped them out of the car and they ran to him like puppies to a biscuit. My heart twisted. Seeing Richard with our kids could still make me melt. It reminded me of all the reasons I\u0027d fallen for him in the first place. But he was my kryptonite. I needed to get away from there, and fast. I pulled the overnight bags from the SUV and all but threw them in Richard\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s their stuff. Where do you want me to pick them up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the Waffle Castle at nine o\u0027clock? We can have breakfast together.\" His voice sounded hopeful, the idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday mornings at the Waffle Castle had been our family ritual. He was too dense to realize his own insensitivity, his stubborn refusal to admit our lives had drastically changed from what they had once been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is your time with them.\" I felt my lips pursing into a prim spinster-quality line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard leaned forward, whispering. \"My therapist says we should have friendly family time together. For the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a split second I felt remorse. Maybe he wasn\u0027t dense. Maybe he wanted to recreate that ritual for the kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your therapist?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, she\u0027s not technically my therapist. Just a friend.\" He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy internal fluttering of optimism turned to churning acidic certainty. He was screwing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pass on breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard shook his head and picked up the kids\u0027 bags. \"Suit yourself. Come on, kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrambled to kiss Paige on the cheek, already overwhelmed with the heaviness of missing them. Jordan was out of my reach, clinging to Richard\u0027s hand and not giving me a second glance. They were so excited to see their father I had become invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, well, have fun,\" I called after them. No one turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the drive to Glenville I had worried my kids would miss me too much this weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was terrified they wouldn\u0027t miss me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed back in my car, knowing the obligatory visit to my mother\u0027s house came next. That did not make me feel better. I hadn\u0027t told her I was coming to town, but some supernatural ability enabled her to discover everything I didn\u0027t want her to know. If I didn\u0027t stop by for a visit, I\u0027d be in trouble. Just one more thing for her to add to the list of my shortcomings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t forgiven me for divorcing Richard, which made no sense to me at all considering she\u0027d divorced my dad with no regrets when I was eleven. Penny and I had come home from a sleepover at my cousin\u0027s house to discover he was gone. No note. No phone call. Just my mom saying she\u0027d told him to leave. No one ever came right out and told us there was another woman, but all the signs were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got remarried a year later, and I only saw him a dozen more times before he died. That was almost fifteen years ago. Eventually the constant ache of missing him became background noise I hardly ever noticed, an ever-present hum, but not so loud it was distracting. Unless I listened for it, as I had when there was no one to walk me down the aisle or on the days my kids were born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArriving at my mother\u0027s house, I knocked lightly on the screen door even though I could see her standing in the kitchen. \"Hi, Mom.\" I stepped inside and automatically wiped my feet on the doormat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a crisp white tennis outfit, her sleek black hair pulled into a stylish clip at the base of her neck. The ice in her tea clunked when she set down the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie, what a surprise.\" There was no move to embrace. Helene Harper considered physical displays of affection vulgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just dropped off the kids with Richard. I wondered if you wanted to have dinner or lunch tomorrow or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have called first. I\u0027ve got the museum gala tomorrow. I\u0027m the chairwoman, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gala is tomorrow?\" I smoothed back an errant strand of my own dark brown hair. People said I looked like her, but other than the coloring I really couldn\u0027t see the similarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you would remember if it\u0027s not important to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst strike, Mommy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s the speaker this year?\" My feigned interest wouldn\u0027t make her forgive my oversight, but we had long been entrenched in this game. I leaned against the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some historian,\" she huffed, dismissing his value. \"Without Richard\u0027s connections, we had a terrible time finding anyone interesting. Don\u0027t slouch, Sadie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to straighten, but caught myself and resisted. \"Mother, you play golf with the mayor\u0027s wife. Surely Richard is not your only connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you come here to be sassy with me?\" She sipped her tea and pointedly did not offer me any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. Sorry.\" I wasn\u0027t really, which was patently obvious. \"You\u0027re booked all weekend, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Unless you want to play tennis with me right now. I\u0027m late for my cardio league.\" She looked at her watch, pushing aside a dozen gold bracelets to find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t bother mentioning her backhand might improve if she took off some of that bling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Still not any good at tennis. What\u0027s Penny up to today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d have to ask her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was ridiculous, two grown women not able to say what was really on our minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do you plan to be mad at me?\" I blurted out. Damn it. Fontaine\u0027s big mouth was contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother set the glass down so hard tea splashed out. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like you\u0027re still mad about Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother sighed, deep and long. \"I\u0027m not mad at you, Sadie. I simply think you rushed into this divorce. Richard made one mistake and you threw eight years of marriage down the drain. And the children will suffer for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat started in my gut and spread in every direction. My heart pounded as if a gun were pointed at it. \"You think I made this decision lightly? You divorced Dad for cheating and Penny and I turned out fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheeks flushed carnation red. \"What happened with your father and I has no bearing here. Your situation is completely different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I had poked the sleeping bear. I may as well let her go full grizzly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother tugged at her Lycra tennis top, smoothing it over her trim torso. \"I don\u0027t have time for this, Sadie. I told you, I\u0027m already late for tennis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up her Coach purse and started digging around for her keys. When she looked back up, her eyes were bright with moisture, and I nearly stepped backward from the surprise of it. I\u0027d never seen my mother close to tears. It was jarring. I was suddenly nine years old, telling her about a shattered crystal vase and wanting with all my heart to somehow fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not really going to spend the entire summer with Dody, are you? The novelty will wear off, you know.\" Her voice had softened. Hot tears stung my own eyes, though I wasn\u0027t sure why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might. And when it does, I\u0027ll come back.\" I brushed imaginary crumbs from her spotless counter. \"But for now, we\u0027re having fun at the beach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fun?\" She flicked her wrist, as if fun were an insect to be shooed away. The almost-tears disappeared. Maybe I\u0027d only imagined them. \"Well, I\u0027m late for tennis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arrived at Penny\u0027s house minutes later. She and her husband lived in a beige brick ranch that looked exactly like every other beige brick ranch on the street. I always had to count mailboxes from the corner to make sure I was at the right place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Sade! I\u0027ve missed you! Come see my new kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny tugged at my shirt and pulled me inside with an easy smile. The relationship with my sister was opposite of what I had with my mother. It was open, sometimes too open. In fact, she\u0027d told me things about her husband, Jeff, that would make a sex therapist blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny\u0027s newly decorated kitchen was black and white, with red accents. Everywhere I looked there were ladybugs. A ladybug cookie jar, ladybug seat cushions, and ladybug throw rugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerspiration prickled on my skin. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it darling? I was bored without you in town so I redecorated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even want to set my purse down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny bubbled with laughter. \"Oh my God, I forgot about your ladybug thing. You\u0027re such a freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a freak. But we had, like, a thousand of them in our garage that one year, remember?\" I shivered and flipped over her ladybug placemats before sitting down at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. Do you want some wine or tea or something?\" She pulled glasses from the cupboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just at Mom\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met my eyes. \"Wine it is, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poured a goblet of white for me, then iced tea for herself and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not having any?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy little sister shrugged. \"Not right now. So are you going crazy in Podunk? Have they put in a traffic light yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sipped my wine, but only because gulping it would be tacky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, last year. Apparently it was cause for a parade.\" I filled her in on my time at Dody\u0027s, even confessing my voyeuristic observations of Running Man. This was the sort of thing she usually loved, but today she was acting weird, toying with the iced-tea glass and all but avoiding eye contact. Finally I could take no more suspense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. What the hell\u0027s up with you? You\u0027re a bigger drunk than I am so why no wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny flushed a lovely shade of pink and glanced around the kitchen as if CIA operatives were about to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over my own shoulder, expecting to see Secret Service agents guarding the door. None appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeff and I are trying to get pregnant.\" Her whisper was hoarse with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about time!\" I thumped my hand on the table, almost upending my drink. \"Thank goodness. Paige and Jordan would be teenagers if you took any longer.\" I\u0027d been pestering my sister for years to reproduce. My kids needed cousins. Plus I wanted her to understand the unique joys of parenthood so I could give back all the great advice she\u0027d given me over the years. Because no one is more qualified to give a new mother advice than a twenty-two-year-old coed with no children of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeff is so excited. He keeps talking about one of his swimmers making captain of the fallopian swim team. And the other day I was ovulating so I sexted him a filthy message about coming home for a conjugal visit. He\u0027s all about the baby making. But don\u0027t tell Mom, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027re texting filthy messages to your husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That we\u0027re trying to get pregnant. I don\u0027t need her nagging me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if she knew about you, maybe she\u0027d get off my back about Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny pointed at me. \"Seriously, do not rat me out on this one. I\u0027ll tell people when I\u0027m ready. OK? Jeff\u0027s family will drive us crazy if they hear about this, so he wants to keep it quiet too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I get it. I promise to keep your dirty little secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny smiled again, lifting her glass for a toast. \"Thank you. In that case, I won\u0027t tell Mom you\u0027re fantasizing over some shirtless jogger from the beach. Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. And since your kids are with Richard for the next two days, you can stay here and help me plan the nursery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I still have my own house here, you know. And there are a couple friends I should connect with, but I will certainly help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t heard much from my neighbors over the last few weeks and I had lots of catching up to do. So often socializing plans were hatched while we were all out in our yards - impromptu barbeques, trips to the community pool, things like that. So it wasn\u0027t terribly odd none of them had called. But I kind of wished they had. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-3.html","bookId":2788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM"}
