Each contest more challenging than the last.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Edur eyed her, expressionless, then he said, ‘Among the audience, there are those who are entertained.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, he added, ‘Yes, this Tarthenal will come last. The decision was unanimous among our observers.’ Then he shrugged and said, ‘I came to see for myself. Although my judgement has no relevance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That Seguleh was very good,’ Samar Dev said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps. But she has sparred with no others.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They hold her in great respect.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even now?

The Trell who was with him is gone. Probably dead. Now there is a desert warrior I could break with one hand. There would have been none to stop us, this Icarium and me. He knew that. So he fled.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You damned fool, Karsa. Icarium is not the kind of warrior who spars. Do you understand me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We would not have sparred, Samar Dev.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So why spend yourself against him? Is it not these Edur and their Letherii slaves you seek vengeance against?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When I am finished with their Emperor, I will seek out Icarium. We will finish what we began.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Beware gathering the men before the battering ram, Karsa Orlong.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A foolish saying,’ he pronounced after a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, and why is that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Among the Teblor, men are the battering ram. Look upon me, Samar Dev. I have fought and won. See the sweat on my muscles? Come lie with me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, I feel sick.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will make you feel better. I will split you in two.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That sounds fun.

In the opposite direction, I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted, then looked round. ‘Perhaps the Seguleh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, really! You just broke her arms!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She won’t need them.
