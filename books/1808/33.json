How did I not know about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The design and location greatly aid in the process, and it is heated with a fire during nights. I would be surprised if you did know of it, as it is located in the kitchen gardens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair was silent as Elle struggled to sit upright in the bed. When she was appropriately situated Elle ruefully smiled at Severin. “You were right, I caught a cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin acknowledged the comment by tipping his head forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not so bad. Last time I was ill it was in the middle of a rainy season and I was stranded outside. That was a wretched time. Besides, I don’t think I’ve ever had so many concoctions poured down my throat before,” Elle said, her head lolling to the side. “As much as it surprises me, I think some of them actually work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Duval wished for me to inform you that there is a ready supply of sugar and aqua vitae, should you need a way to stop coughing,” Severin said, gesturing to a tray that held a bowl of sugar, a spoon, and a glass bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s how you found out? Duval told you?” Elle asked, squinting at the prince. It was hard to see him in the dimly lit room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I inquired after you when you did not appear at dinner,” Severin said, uncomfortably shifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You missed me!” Elle crowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The wretched dog missed you,” Severin dryly said. “I don’t believe he let go of my waistcoat the entire meal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor Jock. Emele won’t let him come in my room while I’m sick,” Elle sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin shifted when silence blanketed the room. “Is there anything you need or want? Is there anything that would make your illness more pleasant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so. Emele is doing her best to make me comfortable. She feels guilty, the poor thing. I am happy that you came to visit, though,” Elle said. “The flowers are beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin bowed slightly—Elle could tell only because the white cuffs of his dark waistcoat dipped lower. “You are welcome,” he paused. “I should take my leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle’s smile dimmed. “Of course. Have a pleasant evening.” She watched Severin’s dark shape slip to the door, and closed her eyes. She startled when there was a thump at her bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin placed an armchair a short distance from her bed and settled into it. “You will not require conversation,” he said, pulling a small book from inside his waistcoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle mutely shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin nodded. “Go to sleep,” he added as an afterthought before turning all of his attention to his book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle watched Severin read, occasionally sneezing and sniffling. The prince stirred only to add logs to the fireplace, and eventually Elle’s eyelids sank and she again drifted off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week later Elle laughed as she hurried up a hallway. Jock scurried after her, barking in sheer joy—although he occasionally stopped to snap at a decorative suit of armor or painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Jock,” Elle called. The little dog was halfway down the hallway, panting heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door creaked open and Severin exited his study. “You are making a great deal of noise considering you have just recovered from a cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m celebrating the recovery and the regaining of my independence. One cannot celebrate quietly,” Elle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t suppose you do much of anything quietly,” Severin dryly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct. Jock!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin winced at Elle’s shout, but Jock ran the remaining distance to Elle’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” Elle asked as the fluffy dog plopped down at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The library. I need some research materials.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In that case Jock and I shall accompany you,” Elle gallantly offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am surprised your keeper has released you. Does she know you are raising a racket?” Severin asked as they started down the hallway. Jock ran ahead of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emele gave me her blessing to run free. She is occupied, supervising the cleaning of my room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, that would explain your celebration.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be happy. You will not be forced to dine alone,” Elle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will not dignify that comment with a response,” Severin said, pulling a chuckle out of Elle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If anything, I should—whoop!” Elle said as they reached the main floor and Severin pulled her back in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avert your eyes,” Severin said, his voice quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The mongrel has found Heloise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand,” Elle said, craning to see the housekeeper and Jock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe well groomed Papillon barked as he flew down the stairs, bounding up to Heloise. The tall, stork-like housekeeper had her hands planted on her hips, but when Jock circled her she crouched and held out her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog launched himself at her, and she held him like a baby, tickling his tummy as she stood. A smile, the first smile Elle had ever seen Heloise display, was on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle stared at the spectacle. “Incredible,” she finally said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-33.html","bookId":1808,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM"}
