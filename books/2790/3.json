Thank God the press wasn\u0027t there anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s exactly the thing we should be worrying about right now. You\u0027re a beautiful woman, Princess Alexandria, but you\u0027ve got bags under your eyes the size of tea cups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partying,\" she suggested. \"The wild royal lifestyle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice try, but you weren\u0027t anywhere in that issue ofPeople .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shrugged and looked around the large office. \"It\u0027s not a problem for me. It\u0027s just… how things are now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thereis something I\u0027ve been meaning to discuss with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Pohl raised white eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might seem personal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try me, Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying to figure out how to bring it up for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Pohl leaned forward. \"You\u0027re safe here, Princess. You can discuss anything with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with all the ducks?\" There were pictures of mallards on the wall, wood duck statues, antique painted duck decoys, pinheads, spoonbills, and mergansers.Two framed duck prints from America. \"I\u0027m having waterfowl overload. Is it a special thing with you? Were you raised by mallards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Pohl settled back, admirably masking her sigh. She ran a hand through her white curls, adjusted her glasses, and put her pencil down. \"You\u0027re changing the subject, Your Highness. Not surprising, given what happened yesterday, but not helpful, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I can if I want. I can talk about anything in here I want. I\u0027msafe , remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that like you don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. \"Like I said, I can change the subject to whatever I want.\" She drummed her fingers on the arm of the chair, striving not to sound like a spoiled palace brat, and failing. \"Current events. Waterfowl. The state of the Union. Prince William\u0027s upcoming marriage, which my dad actually thinks he\u0027ll be invited to. My niece. She\u0027s brilliant, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve said. Your Highness—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s already talking and she\u0027s only one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Your—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s practically toilet training herself and she\u0027s only one. Isn\u0027t that amazing? Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s amazing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fortunately, she won\u0027t ever have to worry about Devon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex felt herself tighten. \"That\u0027s a little obvious for a supposedly subtle analyst, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s always a Devon,\" she said bitterly. \"Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your niece isn\u0027t safe? Your brother? Your father? If someone turns up late, they\u0027ve been kidnapped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I overreacted yesterday, okay? Let\u0027s move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not,\" Dr. Pohl said quietly, \"or we would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-besides, when has safety ever been a guarantee? For anyone, never mind someone in the public eye? Even for the good guys? My family didn\u0027t take this country from Russia by being nice. I\u0027m sure felony assault was involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this is how it\u0027ssupposed to be? You\u0027re a closed-off wreck who can\u0027t sleep because people aren\u0027t nice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my family\u0027s okay for now. If that\u0027s the trade-off, I\u0027ll take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princess Alexandria, it wasn\u0027t a deal.\" Dr. Pohl was leaning forward, her gaze so compassionate Alex had to look away again. \"In fact, it\u0027snot a trade-off. Why shouldn\u0027t your family be alive and well—all respect to your late mother, the queen—and why shouldn\u0027t you have a happy and fulfilling life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for one thing, if I did, you\u0027d be out of business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" she muttered. \"Your sister-in-law keeps me on my toes.\" Then, louder, \"How is the medication working for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s amazing,\" Dr. Pohl said, amused. \"You look like a perfect angel when you lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I think we should try to make some kind of progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of this ismy idea.\" Alex crossed her arms over her chest and jiggled a foot up and down. \"Have you seen my schedule? I\u0027ve got other things to do. Like I said, this wasn\u0027t my idea. Blame my father, the big hen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s safe to say I have never heard the king referred to as a chicken. Your Highness, in all seriousness, I can\u0027t help you if you won\u0027t let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it sounds like we\u0027re done,\" she said, cheering up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit back down, Your Nice Tryness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring at the duck pencil sharpener, she did. She wondered if Congress would give her the power to have Dr. Pohl beheaded. Or at least suspended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you given any more thought to my suggestion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" This was another lie. Some nights, it was all she thought about. But ultimately… \"It\u0027d be like running away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree, Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do. By the way, you should return that blouse. Babyshit tan is not a good color for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your transparent attempt to pick a fight about my admittedly eclectic wardrobe so we get off the subject won\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say, cotton ball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing wrong with trying something new, getting a little perspective. You\u0027ll be doing good work and at the same time, if you got out of the country for a while, it could do you a world of good. And since your brother can\u0027t go, it seems almost… fortuitous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything I need is right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to stay to keep an eye on them, Alexandria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Alexandria, whose mother had been taken from her when she was still a child, and whose father had recently escaped death, put her head in her hands and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027m confused,\" Princess Christina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it must be Wednesday,\" Alex replied, not looking up from her travel itinerary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, ha, Princess Sarcasto. Look, don\u0027t get me wrong, I think a change of scenery is just the thing. Just exactly the right thing. God knows it always cheeredme up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you miss working for the cruise line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Christina replied shortly. \"And don\u0027t change the subject. You\u0027re not a marine biologist. You\u0027re not even—I mean, your specialty is—okay, this is kind of embarrassing, I\u0027m trying to remember, I\u0027m sure I read about this a couple of years ago—whatdid you do in college?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a degree in Nursing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Right. Well, good for you. But you\u0027re not going to a new hospital, right? I guess I\u0027m saying, what\u0027s the point of you going along on this little joyride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than your sinister plan to remove me from the palace so you can further destroy royal protocol?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, besides that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working on Alaskan/American relations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But America and Alaska get along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And it\u0027s like any relationship. It needs constant tending. Such tending is part of our job—your job, too, I might add. So I\u0027ll go along and smile big and answer questions and oversee funds and smash champagne bottles on things. It\u0027s a fluff trip. This looks fine, Jenny.\" Alex scribbled her initials on the bottom of the pages and handed it back to the protocol officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll finalize the preps at once, Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny, my God! Are thoseslacks ?\" Christina, frozen in the act of popping a grape into her mouth, gaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe protocol officer, a woman Alex privately thought was an astonishingly efficient sloe-eyed beauty, blushed to her eyebrows. \"I was taking Your Highness\u0027s advice, but if Your Highness feels I am dressed inappropriately for palace duty—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one of us Highnesses are you talking to? And calm down, I was only teasing. Grape? Look, it\u0027s okay. I\u0027m sorry I even said anything,please relax.\" Christina bullied the smaller brunette into a chair. \"Breathe, okay? Hey, you look great. Doesn\u0027t she look great, Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look great, Jenny,\" she repeated obediently, using all of her poker experience not to smile. Jenny reallydid look a little stressed… but then, she always did. Palace life was not without anxiety, no matter what the job or title. \"Ilike the pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should wear green all the time,\" Christina commented. The moment she released the other woman\u0027s elbow, Jenny sprang back to her feet. \"It makes your eyes look even bigger and darker. And you should take tranquilizers. All the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d leave her alone, she wouldn\u0027t need the tranks,\" Alex commented, picking upThe Palace Poop , the in-house newsletter advising everyone from the reigning king down to the groundskeepers of birthdays, anniversaries, scheduled Softball games, and royal comings and goings. The newsletter had been Christina\u0027s idea. \"Dadtold you to quit needling the officers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, \u0027needling\u0027? I\u0027m just trying to get everyone to lighten up around here. Which is not very damned easy, by the way. I mean, look at you. All stiff and starched and dressed to the nines to eat pudding. And not even chocolate pudding. Tapioca. It\u0027s eleven thirty in the morning on a Tuesday, and Jenny\u0027s all dressed up—it\u0027s still a suit, even if it\u0027s slacks—to hand you some papers. Also, we\u0027re totally pretending that you didn\u0027t conk out at the christening this weekend. Lame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protocol,\" Jenny corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s that stuff on the speaker, Jenn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beethoven\u0027s Fifth,\" she answered, as both women knew she would—Jenny was a fiend for classical music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call that lunchtime music?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you not recognize it?\" Alex asked. \"It\u0027s one of the most famous pieces of music in the world.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-3.html","bookId":2790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM"}
