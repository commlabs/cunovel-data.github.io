Her lack of reaction is starting to worry me, so I place my hand on the back of her head and lower my head closer to hers. “Please. Say something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly lifts her face away from my shoulder and she looks at me with dry eyes. “You called me Hope. Don’t call me that. It’s not my name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even realize I did. “I’m sorry, Sky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes grow cold and she slides off me, then stands up. “Don’t call me that, either,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up and take both of her hands, but she pulls away and turns toward the car. I haven’t really thought out what I would do or say after she finally found out the truth from me. I’m not at all prepared for whatever comes next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a chapter break,” she says, continuing to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t even know what that means,” I say, following behind her. Whatever she needs, it’s more than just a chapter break. She needs a chapter break within a chapter break within a chapter break. I can’t imagine how confused she must be right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continues to walk away so I grab her arm but she immediately jerks away from me. She spins around and her eyes are wide with fear and confusion. She begins to take deep breaths like she’s attempting to hold off a panic attack. I don’t know what to say to her and I know she doesn’t want me to touch her right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes two quick steps forward and she reaches up and grabs my face, standing on the tips of her toes. She presses her lips firmly to mine and kisses me desperately, but I can’t find it in me to kiss her back. I know she’s just scared and confused right now and she’s doing whatever she can to not think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls away from my mouth when she realizes I’m not kissing her back, then she reaches up and slaps me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she’s experiencing right now is more than likely more traumatic and more emotional than anything someone can experience in life, short of death. I try to remember that when she reaches up and slaps me again, then pushes against my chest. Panic consumes her completely and she’s screaming and hitting me and the only thing I can do is spin her around and pull her against my chest. I wrap my arms around her from behind and press my lips to her ear. “Breathe,” I whisper. “Calm down, Sky. I know you’re confused and scared, but I’m here. I’m right here. Just breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold her for several minutes, allowing her time to gather her thoughts. I know she has questions. I just need her mind to the point that it can handle all the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you ever going to tell me who I was?” she asks after she pulls away from me. “What if I never remembered? Would you have ever told me? Were you scared I would leave you and you’d never get your chance to screw me? Is that why you’ve been lying to me this whole time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions she just asked have all been my biggest fears. I’ve been so scared she wouldn’t understand my reasoning for not telling her. “No. That’s not how it was. That’s not how it is. I haven’t told you because I’m scared of what will happen to you. If I report it, they’ll take you from Karen. They’ll more than likely arrest her and send you back to live with your father until you turn eighteen. Do you want that to happen? You love Karen and you’re happy here. I didn’t want to mess that up for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head and laughs a disheartening laugh. “First of all,” she says. “They wouldn’t put Karen in jail because I can guarantee you she knows nothing about this. Second, I’ve been eighteen since September. If my age was the reason you weren’t being honest, you would have told me by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at the ground because it’s too hard to look her in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sky, there’s so much I still need to explain to you,” I say. “Your birthday wasn’t in September. Your birthday is May 7. You don’t even turn eighteen for six more months. And Karen?” I walk forward and take her hands. “She has to know, Sky. She has to. Think about it. Who else could have done this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I say it, she pulls her hands from mine and steps back like I’ve just insulted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me home,” she says, shaking her head in disbelief. “I don’t want to hear anything else. I don’t want to know anything else tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her by the hands again and she slaps them away. “TAKE ME HOME!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re parked in her driveway sitting silently in her car. I made her promise me she wouldn’t say anything to Karen during the drive back to her house. She says she isn’t going to say anything until we talk again tomorrow, but I still don’t like the thought of leaving her here in the condition she’s in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls open the door, but I grab her hand. “Wait,” I say. She pauses. “Will you be okay tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs and falls back against the passenger seat. “How?” she says with a defeated voice. “How can I possibly be okay after tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push her hair behind her ear. I don’t want to leave her. I want to reassure her that I’m not walking away from her this time. “It’s killing me . . . letting you go like this,” I say. “I don’t want to leave you alone. Can I come back in an hour?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head no. “I can’t,” she says weakly. “It’s too hard being around you right now. I just need to think. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, then pull my hand back and place it on the steering wheel. As much as it hurts, I need to give her what she wants right now. I know she needs time to process all the things going through her mind. To be honest, I think I need time to process it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can’t believe I just dropped her off at her house and left. I don’t care if she doesn’t want to be around me right now. There’s no way in hell I can just leave her alone. I wish you were here right now because I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot straight up when I hear her scream next to me on her bed. She’s gasping for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell are you doing here?” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance down at my watch, then rub my eyes. I’m trying to sort out what all has been real in the past few hours and what all was a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it was all real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place my hand on her leg and scoot closer to her. Her eyes are terrified. “I couldn’t leave you. I just needed to make sure you were okay.” I slide my hand around her neck and her pulse is pounding against my palm. “Your heart. You’re scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s looking at me wide-eyed. Her chest is heaving and the fear rolling off her is breaking me. She brings her hand to mine and squeezes it. “Holder . . . I remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately turn her to face me and I force her eyes up to mine. “What do you remember?” I ask, nervous for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe begins to shake her head, not wanting to say it. I need her to say it, though. I need to know what she remembers. I nod my head, silently coaxing her to continue. She takes a deep breath. “It was Karen in that car. She did it. She’s the one who took me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is exactly what I didn’t want her to feel. I hug her. “I know, babe. I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clings to my shirt and I tighten my grip, but push her away as soon as her bedroom door swings open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sky?” Karen says, watching us from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren looks at me, trying to figure out why I’m here. She turns back to Sky. “Sky? What . . . what are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSky spins back around and looks me desperately in the eyes. “Get me out of here,” she begs in a whisper. “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, then stand up and walk to her closet. I don’t know where she wants to go, but I know she’ll need clothes. I find a duffel bag on the top shelf, then walk it to her bed. “Throw some clothes in here. I’ll get what you need out of the bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and heads to her closet while I head into her bathroom to grab whatever else she might need. Karen is pleading with her not to leave. When my hands are full, I walk out of the bathroom and Karen has her hands on Sky’s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing? What’s wrong with you? You’re not leaving with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk around Karen and try to remain as calm as possible for all of our sakes. “Karen, I suggest you let go of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren spins around, shocked at my words. “You are not taking her. If you so much as walk out of this house with her, I’m calling the police.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say anything. I’m not sure if Sky wants her to know that she knows the truth, so I do my best to refrain from saying what I’ve wanted to say to Karen since the moment I realized she’s the one responsible. I zip the duffel bag and reach for Sky’s hand. “You ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t a joke!” Karen yells. “I’ll call the police! You have no right to take her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSky reaches into my pocket and pulls out my cell phone, then steps toward Karen. “Here,” she says. “Call them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s testing Karen. Her wheels are churning as fast as mine and she’s hoping she can prove that Karen is innocent in all of this. It makes my heart break for her, because I know Karen isn’t innocent. This is only going to end badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren refuses to take the phone and Sky grabs her hand and shoves the phone into her palm. “Call them! Call the police, Mom! Please,” she says. Sky’s eyebrows draw apart and she pleads desperately, one last time. “Please,” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t watch Sky endure this for another second, so I grab her hand and lead her to the window, then help her climb out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head off the pillow and immediately cover my eyes. The afternoon sun is so bright, it’s painful. I pry my arm from around her and quietly lift off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI somehow managed the whole drive to Austin last night. I don’t think I could have stayed awake another minute, so I pulled over at the first hotel we could find. It was daytime when we finally made it to our room, so we both took turns showering, then crashed. She’s been asleep for over six hours now and I know how much she needs it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI softly brush the hair away from her cheek and lean down and kiss it. She pulls her arm out from under the blanket and looks up at me with tired eyes. “Hey,” she whispers, somehow smiling despite everything she’s going through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” I say, not wanting her to wake up just yet. “I’m about to leave for a little while to get us something to eat. I’ll wake you when I get back, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and closes her eyes, then rolls back over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we finish eating, she walks to the bed and slips on her shoes. “Where you headed?” I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ties her shoes and stands up, wrapping her arms around my neck. “I want to go for a walk,” she says. “And I want you to go with me. I’m ready to start asking questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a quick kiss, then grab the key and head to the door. “Then let’s go.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-hope-hopeless-2/page-35.html","bookId":2778,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:07 PM"}
