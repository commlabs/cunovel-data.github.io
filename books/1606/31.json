I nod at Star, \"Fix yourself and her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost hit him with the gun, but I don’t. I turn, seeing the way everyone is looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch is holding Will back. I holster my gun and look at Star, \"Did they overrun everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, looking like she might pass out any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027ll stay there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"Michael wanted the mansion; he knew what Bernie had there. He doesn’t care about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrow. She sees the look, \"Soon as I\u0027m better.\" I stalk off, back to the platform. I can\u0027t look at Will and Anna. I know they\u0027re disappointed in me. I am too, but it\u0027s not for the same reason. I wish I\u0027d killed Michael, when I had the chance. I should have known that letting him live would mean that he would find a way to still live the good life, and it would still be on the backs of the weak. I climb the tree and slump onto the platform. Jake giggles. It makes me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you shoot that nice doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and look down at Leo snuggling into a ball again, \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake nods, \"That’s about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun sets and someone brings food. Jake climbs down and gets it. He passes me the fresh bread and stew when he gets back up. I moan, \"The food is getting better, I swear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"It is. At least Nan stopped trying to make goat butter. That was nasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"We need a cow or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a dark figure limping across the field and wince, \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks and laughs, \"This is going to be fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Leo growl and the doctor struggle to get in the tree with the injured legs. He winces and moans, but makes it to the platform, dragging his body across it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake reaches over and pulls him to sit with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor tries to catch his breath, \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe presses his back against the wood of the platform railing, \"So, I want to go to the mansion and tell Michael that this camp is a bust. It\u0027s a little shit show of people barely surviving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll come here to look for themselves, if I don’t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my heads, \"I don’t trust you. Anna may be fooled by Doctor Nick, but I am not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"You will be bringing the small army Michael has down on these people. I can stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean into him, \"You are going to tell him exactly how to get here and exactly how to overrun us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at Jake, \"Is she always like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake grins, \"Worse usually. This is her keeping her temper in check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows raise. His dark-blonde hair and dark-blue eyes remind me of family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know you were a Gen baby?\" I ask, ignoring their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, \"I knew always. My mom died; Michael raised me at the lab and explained how much better I was than everyone else. When the world ended, Michael took us to a place to stay safe, while the city was being finished. Things happened faster than he thought they would. He wasn’t as involved in the end of the world as he liked to think he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did he let the seed Gen babies overrun the city and terrorize people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"I think he sees them as superior. He doesn\u0027t see the flaws in the system. He thinks the weaker humans should bow down to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you so calm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"I\u0027m not. I\u0027m just not trained for combat, the way you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle, \"I\u0027m not trained for combat. My dad died when I was ten. This is me surviving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake points, \"It\u0027s similar to combat training though. I guarantee, if there were marines left, she would be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor puts his hand out, \"I\u0027m Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake takes his hand, \"Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"He came here to help Michael terrorize us, and you\u0027re shaking hands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick gives me a look, \"I don’t know how else to make you believe. I came here to seek you out. I was at the breeder farm where you were for a few weeks. I left about four days before you took it down. I would have helped you, if I had known that was what you were going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listen to the silence of the forest and shake my head, \"I don’t want your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can birth that baby for Anna and I can stop Michael from coming here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my gaze, \"How? Go there and tell him everything is shit here and we\u0027re toothless mountain people? Then what, genius? You think he\u0027s going to miss the fact you\u0027re leaving again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"I\u0027ll go with the next scouting party and run away when we attack. They\u0027ll think I died. I\u0027ll be back before it\u0027s time to birth the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake nods, \"This is a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. He stays and keeps Anna safe. That’s the plan, or he dies. He doesn’t leave the yard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick smiles, \"You really are a hard ass. You remind me of Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl. Jake slides along the boards between us, \"Whoa, let\u0027s not start name calling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick\u0027s eyes burn, \"I didn’t mean it in a bad way. I meant it as a compliment. He had the potential to be someone amazing once. He let his God complex get to him. I don’t think you have that flaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin at him, \"I have others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs bitterly, \"I am betting I haven’t even seen half of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up, \"We haven’t even scratched the surface.\" I toss Jake the rifle, \"Don’t shoot yourself.\" I climb down, trying to hide the fact I am a seething mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to go to my meeting tree but I don’t. I decide to face the music. I walk up to the door of the house as someone clears their throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance behind my shoulder at Mitch standing in a shadow. His right eye is swollen shut. He points from the dark doorway of the barn, \"You gonna kiss this better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort and press my back against the door, \"Is Star okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"She\u0027s fine. She\u0027s like you, heals quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we the lucky ones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I don’t think so. That irrational temper of yours isn’t worth the fast healing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, \"Is Will okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"No. That’s where I got this little gift. He\u0027s pissed. He sent Jake out to the tree; he knew he\u0027d toss you over the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"I might win that fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs, \"Not likely.\" He waves me off, \"You better go face the music again.\" He slips back into the shadows, no doubt going to the loft to do his turn at the watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach aches and burns, but I open the door, ignoring the look I get from the cook pit ladies. I give a simple nod and walk down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don’t blame you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at them. The Jake dog gives me a happy look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don’t blame you. God knows what has become of our friends at the mansion. God knows what that monster is capable of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and walk down the hallway. I go face the really mean one first. She glares at me as I open the door. Leo jumps on her bed, trying to soften her for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubs his fur, glaring at me. I put my hands in the air, \"I told him he can stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you shot him twice—how generous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Anna, he\u0027s one of them. He\u0027s one of them, whether we see it or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points at me, \"You\u0027re one of them too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and pinch the bridge of my nose, \"I\u0027m worse. Night.\" I step out and close the door, leaving Leo in there to try to make her feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on the knob but the door flies open. Star stares at me from the doorway. I don’t know what to say or think, so I go for the obvious, \"You alright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks back at Will who is sitting on the bed with no shirt on in a pair of shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are wide, guilty. It makes me sick, but I have to assume it\u0027s nothing. The fire burning inside of me is trying to explode, but I fold my arms over my chest, holding myself together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I will be. I\u0027m healing quickly. You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"How bad is the village?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes water, \"Sully, uhm…\" She starts to cry, \"Sully is gone. He fought a lot of them and most of our people got away—they ran. They knew the trail through the bomb woods so when they got chased Michael\u0027s men got blown up. A lot of them are dead.\" A sickening grin crosses her lips, \"It\u0027s probably only twenty men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"We can take twenty men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wipes her tears and shakes her head, \"We gotta kill him. He\u0027s already planning shit. He\u0027s been taking the infected and releasing them on towns. Hordes of infected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why he was caging them. I shake my head, \"That doesn’t even make sense. He\u0027s just making more of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs, \"I don’t think he cares. I think he just wants the borderlands cleansed of people like them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks at us, \"Night, Star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and gives me a sorry look, \"Night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks past me down the hall. I enter the room and close the door. Will gives me a hard look, \"You want them to stay here, and then you scare the shit out of them when a single guys shows up. You know how many people wanted to leave today, terrified of when the crazy girl was going to snap and kill everyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow my defense and let him get pissed off. He\u0027s sweating again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go around shooting people and acting nuts. You have to learn to use your words and not your hands.\" He coughs and I see something red fly from his lips. I look down at the blankets, \"How long has that been going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"It\u0027s nothing. Just the old wound acting up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to him and press my hand against his face. He\u0027s hot like Jake was that one time. I close my eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-31.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
