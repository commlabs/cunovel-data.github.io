As for the ghost face on the canopy, its eyes began to widen, making it almost seem alive. It wasn’t crying, it wasn’t laughing, its eyes were just growing exaggeratedly large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost as if, after an entire lifetime of absorbing life force, it had never imagined a day in which it would encounter life force as shockingly powerful as this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to the side, Gongsun Wan’er looked on in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re… you’re stealing its life force…?” she murmured, her mind almost a complete blank. To see Bai Xiaochun exhibiting this level of daring and madness surpassed anything she could ever have imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sharp contrast, Bai Xiaochun seemed to be taking everything in stride. Of course, that was only because of the mountain-toppling, sea-draining life force that was pouring into him, battering his mind and making it almost impossible to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like his brain was being struck by a million bolts of heavenly lightning. Any other person, even a celestial, would have been unable to accept this much life force. But considering the level of his fleshly body, and his foundation with the Undying Live Forever Technique, dealing with this life force was like a walk in the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, his bones began to emit cracking sounds, and his flesh and blood began to swell. Already, he felt like he was absolutely stuffed to the limit. And so far, only one breath of time had passed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, despite being stuffed, the life force continued to flow into him. Apparently, the egg sac had previously reached a state of almost full completion. Therefore, when the Eternal Parasol stabbed into it, it was like a balloon that suddenly lost its stability, causing the life force to rush out in maddening fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second breath of time which passed since stabbing the egg sac, the foundation of his Undying Live Forever Technique seemed to tremble on the verge of collapse, and then solidify, almost as if it were being tempered. As a result, his Undying Live Forever Technique, which had already reached the ultimate limit of its power, began to transform!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as Bai Xiaochun’s aura climbed, growing more intense. Although he was still in the early Celestial Realm, anyone who could assess his level would probably place him at the peak of the mid Celestial Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came the third breath of time. The foundations of Bai Xiaochun’s body had seemingly reached their limit, and yet the life force continued to flow into him, causing him to inflate almost like a balloon. In the blink of an eye… Gongsun Wan’er watched as the previously well-proportioned Bai Xiaochun transformed into a huge fat person!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t a mountain of flesh, but rather a round, ball-like fatty!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this point, he was large enough to count for ten of his previous selves. In fact, if he had gained lucidity in that moment, he would surely have looked at himself and thought of what Big Fatty Zhang had looked like back when he first met him in the Ovens of the Spirit Stream Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this takes some time to describe, but actually happened in only three short breaths’ worth of time. When the fourth breath of time arrived, the egg sac let out a roar that shook all of Murknine County!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a roar filled with unprecedented rage, fury, and defiance. There was also a touch of incredulity within it, as well as shock. When the roar reached Gongsun Wan’er’s ears, it made her feel like her divine sense and even her physical body were about to be ripped apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed out of her mouth as she sped backward, a look of shock on her face. The power contained within that roar of rage surpassed that of a celestial, and it caused a look of despair to appear in her eyes. She could only retreat, blood oozing out of her eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and even her pores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all happened too quickly. As Gongsun Wan’er fell back, Bai Xiaochun felt the power of the roar assailing him, and the Eternal Parasol felt a massive force heading toward it from within the egg sac!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCracks began to spread out on the parasol’s shaft, and its ribs began to show signs of shattering. The ghost face was trembling as it realized it was dealing with an entity far more terrifying than itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Bai Xiaochun seemed to be able to deal with what was happening. He was now so exceptionally fat, and had so much life force in him, that the sound of the roar only made him feel slightly dizzy. However, after a few breaths of time passed, and he began to regain his lucidity, the intensity of the roar increased. More blood sprayed out of Gongsun Wan’er’s mouth, and she teetered unstably, as though she might fall over at any moment. At that point, Bai Xiaochun was fully back to normal, and could sense the madness in the roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could also feel something like a tempest screaming inside of him, both causing his face to fall and blood to ooze out of the corners of his mouth. Thankfully, despite his increased size, he was still quite nimble. After noticing that Gongsun Wan’er was drenched in blood and seemed to be about to pass out, he waved his sleeve to pull her over and hold her up against his enormous belly….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding, he fell back, hoping to get out of the massive crater as quickly as he could. At the same time, the howling egg sac began to rip apart. Cracks spread out across its surface, mostly from the spot where the Eternal Parasol had stabbed into it. Clearly, the living being which had been growing inside of it was about to emerge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping for breath, Bai Xiaochun drew upon all the power of his cultivation base, as well as the reserves of life force within him, to attain incredible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he was about to leave the crater, an immense cracking sound filled the air as a portion of the egg sac exploded, and a scaled, blood-colored hand reached out, dripping with viscous fluid!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only had four fingers, with razor-sharp claws at the ends of them, and it radiated a sense of profound and deadly evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the hand appeared, the sky flickered, both within Murknine County and in the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, the crimson, scaled hand shot out in the direction of the fleeing Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an attack of heaven-destroying, earth-extinguishing force, something that surpassed the Celestial Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s eyes went wide as an intense sensation of deadly crisis filled him. His first instinct was to go to the damaged fan, even if that meant revealing the secret of the fan to Gongsun Wan’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the spiderweb that had the entire county sealed up also severed all types of energy connections, a barrier that Bai Xiaochun couldn’t get past at his current level of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment of crisis, Bai Xiaochun felt himself going completely mad. Howling, he summoned the Greatsword of the North and slashed it through the air behind him, causing it to change shape into a protective shield. As for Gongsun Wan’er, despite being on the verge of passing out, she bit down on her tongue and unleashed a magical technique that sent black smoke swirling out in all directions. A world of ghosts was created, with innumerable vicious ghosts joining forces to create a defensive barrier, bolstered by her battleship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, a massive boom erupted out. Bai Xiaochun and Gongsun Wan’er were like rowboats in a hurricane, with the shockwave from the blow like a massive wave that swept over them with incredibly destructive power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren’t the only ones to be affected by the eruption of force. Because Bai Xiaochun had absorbed some of the life force of the entity in the egg sac, its development had been hindered. It had a fatal weakness now: despite its incredible power, it couldn’t focus properly. Therefore, when it unleashed its divine ability, it was something that could destroy everything around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds filled the air as Murknine County came under the attack of a massive hand larger than the county itself! As a result, the entire place began to fall apart!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1138\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1140\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1139","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
