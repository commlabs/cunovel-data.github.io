Why don’t you thank him for all he has done for you?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then said Kangaroo — Tired Old Kangaroo — He’s chased me out of the homes of my childhood; he’s chased me out of my regular meal-times; he’s altered my shape so I’ll never get it back; and he’s played Old Scratch with my legs.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then said Nqong, ‘Perhaps I’m mistaken, but didn’t you ask me to make you different from all other animals, as well as to make you very truly sought after?

Legs are legs, and you needn’t alter ’em so far as I am concerned. I only meant to explain to Your Lordliness that I’ve had nothing to eat since morning, and I’m very empty indeed.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes,’ said Dingo — Yellow–Dog Dingo,—‘I am just in the same situation.
