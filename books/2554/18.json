{"id":111878,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eHank Thompson popped into Drexler\u0027s office to see if he\u0027d calmed down from yesterday. And to see if maybe he\u0027d explain his \"you might be the most surprised of all\" remark. It had bothered him yesterday, but after last night\u0027s dream ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kicker Man in trouble again, worse this time. Just like the past few nights, he\u0027d been under attack by a flock of birds or things that looked like birds - like in that movie where the birds turned on people. Just like before, they swarmed him, but this time they knocked him down and wouldn\u0027t let him get up. And at the end he\u0027d just lain there as they pecked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGave Hank the creeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoying Drexler would take the edge off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of Drexler he found his enforcer, Szeto, in the office. Not just in the office, but seated behind Drexler\u0027s desk. The Kickers had their fair share - some said more than their fair share - of scary guys, but Hank had always found Szeto even scarier. Everything about the guy was black, from his eyes to his hair - Hank had always wanted to ask if he dyed it - to his clothes. He looked better than he had a couple of weeks ago when someone worked him over real good. Anyone who could put that kind of hurt on Szeto had to be one tough mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the boss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister Drexler not in today,\" he said in English warped by an Eastern European accent. Russian? Romanian? Hungarian? They all sounded the same to Hank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he raised his black-booted feet and plopped them on the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know if the boss would like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I look worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank noted the smug tone. What was going down here? A little palace revolt in the works?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto smiled. \"Is something I can help you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank was about to say no, then remembered a little research Szeto had been assigned last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember those guys you were supposed to look into? The one who\u0027d been a kid when Drexler met him - the friend of the brother and sister you were hunting - and John Tyleski, the one who stole something from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStole the Compendium of Srem ... Hank couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d allowed that to happen. He still lay awake some nights dreaming of strangling that son of a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto shook his head. \"Both are dead ends. The boy disappears during college. No record, not of taxes or even Social Security number. Your man, Tyleski, he lives only on paper. Has credit card and Social Security but address is mailbox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank wandered around the office. The news was hardly a surprise. About a year ago - in fact, next month would make it exactly a year - this asshole Tyleski had presented himself as a reporter from the Trenton Times who wanted to interview him about his book and the growing Kicker movement. Back then, Hank would ramble on to anyone who\u0027d listen. The guy had asked all the wrong questions - hell, they almost got into a fight. Hank ran a check and found out the Trenton Times had never heard of John Tyleski. And then he went and robbed Hank of what was unquestionably the most valuable book on Earth - mugged him and snatched it in broad daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank couldn\u0027t report the theft, of course, because the book had been stolen from the Museum of Natural History by one of his Kickers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wait ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertain tidbits began to circulate in his head, bouncing off each other, looking for ways to fit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check this out: We\u0027ve got a real person - personally known to our good buddy Drexler - who grows up and disappears. Later on there\u0027s a person who uses the name of a man who exists only on paper.\" He turned to Szeto. \"Could the first guy have become the second?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto looked mildly interested. \"Possible. But not probable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyleski knew more about me and other things than anybody should know.\" That had become apparent to Hank during the interview. \"And then last summer up pops this guy who Tasers your boss and me while we\u0027re trailing the Fhinntmanchca. Only Drexler got a look at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto smirked. \"No. You must have seen him as well. I understand he was posing as Kicker and was in and out of here many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank had been down with a zillion Taser volts in him and not noticing a whole lot of what was going on in his immediate vicinity. The guy had been wearing a beard so it was hard to sync up memories of Tyleski with Drexler\u0027s description of the Taser guy. No point in getting sidetracked into the possibility that Tyleski could have grown a beard and been right under Hank\u0027s nose for who the hell knew how long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to Drexler, the Taser guy had brown hair and brown eyes, just like Tyleski, and he also knew all sorts of stuff no one outside the Order should know. So, couldn\u0027t he and Tyleski be the same person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto looked a little more interested. \"Possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still not probable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we agree on still improbable, but less so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto shrugged. \"If you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Then, as I recall, last summer you were looking for a woman who knew lots more than she should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto\u0027s eyes flashed. \"Louise Myers, yes. We know where is bitch but the One does not wish her touched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if we - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The One has spoken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank sighed. The One, the One, the One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Be that as it may, I recall that she had a protector who killed just about every man you sent against her. A man you never saw and could never find. And the Myers gal comes from that same town as the man Drexler knew as a boy, the one who vanished without a trace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto dropped his feet from the desk and leaned forward. \"You really think...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I\u0027m saying is we\u0027ve got three guys messing with us - \u0027Tyleski,\u0027 the Taser guy, and the killer - and no one knows who they are or where they are. They\u0027re untraceable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you mention boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. The boy - a fourth guy we can\u0027t find. A circle is a perfect shape, and I see things circling back to a certain boy in that small town in Jersey. Could all four mystery men turn out to be just one guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto pounded his fist on the desk. \"But we do not know where he is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boy\u0027s got to have family - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All dead or disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re left with Louise Myers, who you\u0027re afraid to touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto smiled like a snake. \"You are free to approach her. Do not let me stop you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing against the One ... uh-uh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, looks like we\u0027re stuck, amigo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not stuck. He has been to high school and to university. We can get picture - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right-right-right. Yearbooks.\" Hank hadn\u0027t thought of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can see if face is same as Tyleski.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027ll answer some questions about who he is, but we won\u0027t be any closer to knowing where. Let\u0027s just hope that if the One changes his mind about the Myers babe, he lets your people know. Because she can point us to him, and I sorely want to get my hands on that fucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto rose to his feet and puffed up behind the desk. \"The One speaks to me. He will tell me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank stared at Szeto as the implications of that remark sank in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he spoke to your boss - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Speaks to me. He comes to me for solution to problems. If he does not wish Myers woman disturbed, okay. I am in her hometown many times. I can find other way perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Jersey? What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is not your concern. The One gives me many things to do and I am taking care of them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany things to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat smirk again. \"If the One wishes you to know, I am sure he will tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Drexler been taken out of the loop? Hank didn\u0027t like that. Not one bit. Because if Drexler had been booted aside, Hank might be next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... You might be the most surprised of all ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, he might have been given the boot already and didn\u0027t even know it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-18.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
