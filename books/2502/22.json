Five oil-lamps were lit, although it was only mid-afternoon, and their light shone on the table where Sanct-Franciscus was working. \"Thank you, Rugeri,\" he said as he carefully closed the lid on a chalcedony jar filled with an ointment of foxglove, then gave Natalis his full attention. \"Have you any notion why I asked you to come here?\" he began, his demeanor carefully neutral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis hitched up his shoulder. \"You have a message or some item you want taken somewhere without being noticed; I am ready to do as you order, rain or no rain,\" he said, but his flickering eyes revealed his apprehension. His pallium was new, made of slate-blue wool, and decorated at the hem with a band of dust-colored heavy cotton; the bracae he wore beneath were made of tan cotton, and his peri were bronze-colored leather. On the street on such a day as this, his garments would render him invisible as much as his skills as a thief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just now, I think,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, coming away from the table. He looked over at Rugeri. \"Will the hot wine be brought shortly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will,\" said Rugeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis cocked his head. \"You want wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Natalis; you do.\" Sanct-Franciscus drew up a chair to the low table in the center of the room and indicated the chair opposite. \"Do sit down. There is something we must talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds ominous,\" said Natalis with a shaky chuckle as he dropped into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it?\" Sanct-Franciscus very nearly smiled at that. \"Well, we shall see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a bit puzzled why you want to see me, because you haven\u0027t sent for me this way before,\" Natalis said, ending on a note of uncertainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I have not,\" Sanct-Franciscus concurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... I am honored that you\u0027ve called me here,\" Natalis went on, trying to cover his growing edginess with talk. \"I was thinking just this morning how what seemed to be my least fortunate day-the day I was caught in the Forum Agricolarum-became one of the most fortunate of my life. You have been most generous to me since you took me into your household: three new garments in seven months-truly beneficent of you, and I not a slave, but your servant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, maintaining his unnerving reserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have another assignment for me?\" Natalis glanced at Rugeri. \"Your manservant wouldn\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you may think of this as an assignment,\" said Sanct-Franciscus slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will ready my pluvial and be off as soon as you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your assignment today need not expose you to the weather,\" said Sanct-Franciscus tranquilly. \"It is to tell me the truth. We did agree you would do that, did we not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis went silent, his eyes moving more frantically, as if searching for a means of escape. \"Certainly. Of course. The truth about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About whomever has employed you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, his self-containment unimpaired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work for you,\" said Natalis, the pitch of his voice rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly pay you for doing that, and you have executed your missions for me satisfactorily,\" Sanct-Franciscus said in the same steady voice. \"But I have reason to believe that you are also accepting money from another employer, who has engaged you to report on me, someone who seeks to know more of me than I am required to tell.\" He looked directly at Natalis. \"Is that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis bleated out something that might have been a laugh. \"No. No. Of course no. Why would I do anything that might be against you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are questions I have asked myself,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"You must understand that I am eager to know the answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do understand,\" said Natalis, almost leaping out of his chair at the tap on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRugeri turned and opened the door, and took the tray Aedius held, exchanged a few words with him, and closed the door. \"The kitchen sends word that the evening meal will be delayed by an hour. The breads aren\u0027t rising properly-it\u0027s the rain.\" He put the tray on the low table, pointing out its contents. \"Hot wine in an earthenware jug, a cup, and fried cheese with bitter herbs on a plate.\" With a nod, he went back to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, leaning forward to fill the cup with the steaming wine, deep-red in color and smelling of spices. \"You will like this, I know,\" he said to Natalis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct-Franciscus held out the cup. \"Drink it.\" Natalis took a deep sip, then started to put it down. \"All of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All?\" Natalis asked, hesitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of it. The room is chilly, and the wine will warm you.\" He sat expectantly. \"If you fear you might become fuddled, have some of the cheese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis stared at the cup as if he expected it to burst into flame. \"I ... I don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink it,\" Sanct-Franciscus said again, firmly but affably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t drink,\" Natalis said. \"It is not proper that a servant should drink and the master abstain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and the rest of the household know that I never-\" Sanct-Franciscus reminded him, only to be interrupted by Rugeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right!\" Natalis hurriedly gulped down the wine, and then glared at Sanct-Franciscus. \"I have drunk. How long before I die?\" He set the cup on the tray, staring at it with dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is up to you and your gods; it has nothing to do with me.\" Sanct-Franciscus laughed once and shook his head. \"Oh, no, Natalis. You have not consumed poison. Had I wanted to be rid of you, I have other methods at my disposal not nearly so clumsy as poison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis looked shocked. \"Then why insist I drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you will not behave liked a trapped rabbit,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, suddenly brusque; then he softened his tone. \"If you were any more jittery, you would shake your chair to flinders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, and so would you,\" said Natalis, summoning up the courage to bluster. \"To be brought up here like a shamed apprentice, and be accused of disloyalty, then made to drink-What would you think, in my position?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would think my errors in judgment had been discovered, and that would trouble me,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, once again calm. \"Which is what I want to know: what are your errors in judgment, Natalis? I will not yet call what you have done disloyalty, but if you withhold anything\"-he paused to refill the cup-\"then I may have to consider that you have an inclination to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis stared at the cup. \"Not more wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you please,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, handing the cup back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Natalis made no protest, but quickly drank the contents of the cup, set it back on the tray and reached for a cube of the fried cheese, wolfing it down, then licking his fingers as he said, \"Whatever it is you want to find out, you don\u0027t have to do it this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is truth in wine,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, watching as Natalis took a second cube of cheese. \"When I say you will tell me the truth, I want it to be as bare as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bare?\" Natalis appeared baffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without modifications that might color its meaning,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"Have another bite of cheese if you feel the wine too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis took two cubes of cheese and stared at them, as if noticing the flakes of herbs for the first time. \"What is in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitter herbs, I believe, such as are served with eggplant and asparagus, and with poached eggs,\" said Sanct-Franciscus with great unconcern. \"The cheeses are fried in oil-with-garlic, from their aroma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost defiantly, Natalis consumed them, then said, \"I suppose you want me to drink more wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you would,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, filling Natalis\u0027 cup a third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much more of this, and I won\u0027t be able to give you much of an answer at all,\" Natalis warned before he downed the contents of the cup; two bright spots were forming in his cheeks, as if he were suffering from a fever. He coughed once, and did his best to focus on Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 face. \"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To whom do you report, and what do you tell him?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked with civility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that I wanted to,\" said Natalis, his words slurring a little. \"I told him I didn\u0027t want to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you were compelled,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"Why and how, if you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he would find out if I said anything to you, and he would have me arrested by the Urban Guard.\" Natalis squirmed in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That only means he has other spies in my household. He will learn nothing of this from me or from Rugeri,\" Sanct-Franciscus assured him. \"Tell me who it was who could so impose on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An official, not one of high rank, spoke to me.\" He closed his eyes as if trying to recapture the moment in his thoughts. \"How could I refuse to talk with such a man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would think you would have to oblige him, at least to hear him out,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"Who was this official?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was approached by a decuria-Telemachus Batsho-who said he would have me condemned to a road gang for theft if I didn\u0027t agree to report to him.\" He stopped, aghast at what he heard himself say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"And I gather he ordered you to tell me nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Natalis, almost panting with relief at this confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did this happen?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked. \"When did he suborn your loyalty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis winced, then summoned up his determination. \"I will tell you the whole of it. I might as well, now.\" He drank the last of the wine in his cup, and continued on. \"It was in July. I was returning from Ostia, with reports from your captains, and account-books. When I reached the Porta Ostiensis, the Watch detained me, they said because they had to verify the account-books; I don\u0027t know why, but I couldn\u0027t refuse the Watch, could I? If they want to look at anything being brought into the city, they have the right to do so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they do. Protesting would have served only to arouse their suspicions,\" Sanct-Franciscus confirmed. \"Continue, Natalis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, watching Sanct-Franciscus as he spoke. \"While I was waiting for them to release the records, in that small chamber next to the Guard-station-you know the one?\" At Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 nod, he went on. \"I was sitting alone there, waiting, as I said, when this fellow Batsho approaches me, and tells me that I could be in great trouble, and so could you, if the accounts were found to be faulty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should that accrue to your discredit: you were acting as a messenger only,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, thinking back to the two acolytes in Persia, and their efforts, with Srau\u0027s help, in undermining of his business dealings, and then to the official in Athens-Hyres-who had found an excuse to levy double taxes on all his property as a result of slaves\u0027 gossip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am known as a thief.\" This cry was compounded of frustration and distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no brand on your arm or your forehead, so his accusation would need proof, which those records would not provide him,\" Sanct-Franciscus observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I am not branded, for which I offer wine in thanks to the Parcae every day. My fate would have been much changed had I ever been branded.\" As if the idea itself overwhelmed him, he slumped back in his chair, one hand flopping on the arm, the other reaching ineffectively for the last of the cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct-Franciscus picked up the plate and held it out to him. \"How did he say he could do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis rubbed his lips together, trying to decide how to answer. \"He said-He claimed he had records of other thefts I had committed, and that he would bring these before the Prefect to determine what punishment should be meted out.\" He took another cube of cheese, holding it between his fingers as if it were a die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would seem to be a bit ... unreasonable,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"Have you been taken before a Prefect in the past?\" He put the plate back down and poured the last of the wine in the jug into Natalis\u0027 cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for years. When I was caught once, six years ago, I convinced the Prefect that there had been a mistake-that my companion had taken the items in question, and since no one found any of the ... objects in my wallet, it was assumed I hadn\u0027t taken anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you had,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, pouring another measure of wine into Natalis\u0027 cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had, and passed them to my cousin. Nyssa attracted no attention from the Guard.\" He sobbed once, suddenly. \"I miss her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your cousin must have been a great help to you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until the last two years, when her hands became knotted with age, she was the finest help I could have asked for,\" said Natalis with earnest pride and slurred words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you continued to provide for her, when she could no longer help you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"Commendable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until you found work for her,\" said Natalis, and swallowed hard. \"And you arranged for an honorable burial for her.\" His hands gathered and his face contorted in grief and self-loathing. \"I know I should have come to you at once. You have been a most upright employer, and my dealing with the decuria is shabby, I know. I know.\" He bit into the cheese as if to force himself to stop talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct-Franciscus held out the cup to him. \"This will make it easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis took the cup with both hands, and drank. He sighed as he put the cup back on the tray. \"Empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I see,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis stared at the far wall, his eyes glazed, his features slack. Finally he looked over at Sanct-Franciscus. \"I suppose you\u0027ll be rid of me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-unless you want to go,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" said Natalis, his manner at once more animated. \"I want to stay here, in your service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you shall remain,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"But instead of doing the bidding of the decuria, you will do mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis sat up. \"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean,\" said Sanct-Franciscus patiently, \"that whenever Batsho makes a request of you, you will inform me of it-privately, of course-and you will follow my instructions, not his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he finds out-\" Natalis said in a new rush of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has other spies in this household: I know,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"I think you will find I am able to deal with them so long as you are forthright with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalis was far from comfortable, but he tried to put on the appearance of satisfaction. \"I think it will be satisfying to catch this bird in his own net.\" He belched and tried to cover his mouth with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes; so do I,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, getting to his feet again, and motioning to Rugeri to approach as he addressed Natalis. \"You have told me what I want to know, and for that I am grateful. But I warn you now that if you continue to compromise my interests, you will be cast out into the street.\" He saw Natalis blanch and went on more cordially. \"You will want to rest a while now, I presume, so Rugeri will assist you back to your quarters. You will not be disturbed until you rise of your own accord.\" He stepped back so Rugeri could assist Natalis out of the chair. \"Once he has lain down, come back and you and I will consider how to proceed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my master,\" said Rugeri as he tugged Natalis to his feet, supporting him with his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what more you learn from him,\" Sanct-Franciscus said as Rugeri maneuvered Natalis toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt there will be much to learn the rest of this day, or evening,\" said Rugeri as he reached for the latch on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not,\" said Sanct-Franciscus as he watched Rugeri get Natalis out the door, then he crossed the room to close it behind them. Left by himself, he went to the brazier and added more wood to the wedges already burning in it; he noticed that the smoke was beginning to dull the painting on the ceiling, and decided he would put the chamber-slaves to cleaning it as soon as the rain ended. Returning to his trestle table, he set his case of medicaments on the end of the table, then took one of the fan-folded sheets of vellum from the pigeon-holes above the table and spread it open, studying its contents with careful attention. He was still going over household records when Rugeri tapped twice and stepped into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will sleep for many hours,\" said Rugeri as he entered the study, taking care to check the corridor before closing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With what he consumed, I would suppose so,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, turning from his work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was in the wine?\" Rugeri inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spices; anything more would have lacked finesse. There were herbs in the cheese that promoted a loose tongue along with a sense of repose, and will let him sleep deeply.\" He gave Rugeri a contemplative stare. \"What do you make of this predicament, my friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRugeri weighed his response. \"Assuming he was truthful, I have to say that it appears Batsho has decided to make an example of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An example of what, though?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked of the folded sheets on the table before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A foreigner with money,\" said Rugeri succinctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are other foreigners with money in Roma,\" Sanct-Franciscus reminded Rugeri. \"Why choose me, when Solon Monandos has far more money than I, and displays it far more freely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Batsho may feel kinship with Greeks like Monandos,\" Rugeri suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Batsho is from Illyricum, hardly a region known for liking its neighbors, particularly the Greeks,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, thinking back to the centuries of skirmishes along the edge of the Balkans, Greeks to the south of the mountains, Illyricani to the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRugeri shook his head. \"You mistake my intention: you are from Dacia but not a Daci. That means you have few defenders in Roma, and may be abused with impunity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct-Franciscus laughed sardonically. \"Rogerian, you have not lost your clarity of insight, nor your directness of speech.\" He began to put the scrolls back in their pigeon-holes. \"I think,\" he went on in the tongue of Alexandria, \"that we would be wise to step up our plans. I had thought I could remain here for another three or four years, but now I think a year-and-a-half is a more reasonable prognosis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say,\" Rugeri seconded. \"But what of Domina Clemens? This is her house, and if you leave, she may find it confiscated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she might, if it is empty. I must make it my business to see that she has an occupant for it, and a good return on their presence.\" He folded his hands. \"I don\u0027t want this to end badly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Rugeri. \"But that may be out of your hands, my master. This Batsho is determined to make his reputation on your fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears so,\" Sanct-Franciscus said, and added, \"I wish I knew what his next move will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt he wishes the same about you,\" said Rugeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hence the spies in my household,\" Sanct-Franciscus agreed, and went back to speaking the Latin of the time. \"He has set his gaze on me, and will not relent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why should he?\" Rugeri asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose because he can-because he requires proof of the small power he possesses.\" Sanct-Franciscus clicked his tongue in annoyance. \"I must hope that we can discover some way to prevent the worst from happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you decided what the worst would be?\" Rugeri watched Sanct-Franciscus carefully, knowing this calm remoteness concealed both anger and rapid thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I feel sure Telemachus Batsho has a vision for what is to come,\" he said, sitting down at his trestle table, and reaching for vellum on which to write. \"If you will spend time with the household this evening, I would appreciate knowing what they are thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should they tell me anything?\" Rugeri asked. \"I am your manservant; they know I am loyal to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They may speak if you complain of my ... my stubbornness, perhaps,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, \"Tell them that I am refusing to deal with trouble, and that puts you at a real disadvantage. Shared rancor can be most informative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will know I\u0027m lying,\" said Rugeri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some may think so, but most will take complaint as being in accord with their own difficulties, and that should ease the way for you.\" He began to rub the ink-cake with a smooth jasper stone; the water around the cake turned dark as he worked. \"I will send this to Olivia tomorrow, by courier, so that she will know of what is about to transpire here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you have Natalis carry it?\" Rugeri kept his voice level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No; that would upset Batsho. I will hire a courier, since he will have to go a very long way. If I provide the horses and biga, I can undoubtedly find an experienced charioteer to drive the roads north.\" He picked up his stylus and prepared to write. \"I am going out later tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the Villa Laelius?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No; I will find a sleeping woman who will welcome a sweet dream. I have no wish to put Doma Ignatia in any more danger than I have already brought her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRugeri ducked his head. \"Just so,\" he said as he withdrew from the study, leaving Sanct-Franciscus to explain to Atta Olivia Clemens how his plans had changed and how they would impinge upon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a sworn statement by Egidia Adicia Cortelle, Domina Laelius, made to Janarius Amerius Garne, Prefect of the Curia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAve, Heliogabalus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this day, the 11th of December in the 972nd Year of the City, I, Egidia Adicia Cortelle, Domina Laelius, before Jupiter, Minerva, Consivius, Astraea, and Nemesis, swear that all I say here is truthful, that I will stand before the Senate and proclaim the same to them, under penalty of beating should I in any way prevaricate or wrongfully accuse an innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gives me profound distress to have to come forth with this complaint, because it reflects badly upon our family, the lares, and our gens that these crimes have taken place under our roof. Because I am confined to my bed, it required my son, Marius Octavian, to inform me of what had taken place. My son, being only fifteen, cannot officially testify to what he saw, and therefore charges me with speaking for him, with the assurance that what he says is truthful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I have mentioned, I am confined to my bed. My physician is one Ragoczy Germainus Sanct-Franciscus, who has been ministering to my suffering for more than three years. Of all physicians I have engaged over the years, he is the one who has most consistently alleviated the worst of my anguish, so I am doubly distressed to have to make these misdeeds known, for his care and devotion as a physician have been beyond criticism. Yet he is the one who has so grievously trespassed against our good name and the rectitude of the gens. Little as I may want to lose so excellent a physician, I realize it is my duty to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the household I have an unmarried daughter, now twenty-five, Doma Pax Ignatia Laelius, who has been tasked with my routine care. She has often come in the way of Sanct-Franciscus, and I have observed that she has become fascinated with him, seeking reasons to visit his house-ostensibly on my behalf-and to require his company when the household is asleep, and I am not in any need of succor. I must lay some responsibility upon her for what has taken place, for had she not thrown herself at him, I believe Sanct-Franciscus would have confined himself to my care and left my daughter alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy son has informed me that he surprised Sanct-Franciscus with Doma Ignatia in the spring house at the back of our garden, where they were engaged in debauched practices, she being completely naked, he about to ravish her, but still clothed, for which I must be grateful. My son did not speak of this for many days, fearing it would have a detrimental impact on my health, but he reached a point when he could no longer contain himself, for he was worried that my daughter was going to meet with Sanct-Franciscus again, and clandestinely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI charged Doma Ignatia with her brother\u0027s suspicions as well as his account of their meeting in the spring house. I was taken aback when Doma Ignatia did not deny any part of the account I repeated, and added that she was only sorry that more had not taken place. I ordered her not to speak to him again, and to absent herself from this house on those occasions when he is here to treat me, and she refused. This defiance has led to a most lamentable rancor between us, and has contributed to my most recent crisis, from which I am only now emerging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is painful to say this, but my daughter, being intractable, is now declaring she will leave this house and apply to Sanct-Franciscus for his protection. This would be intolerable. Many illustriata may conduct themselves licentiously, but those of us who uphold the old values of Roma cannot countenance such dishonor: if my daughter attempts to leave this house, she must be confined to my brother\u0027s estates in Asisium until such time as she renounces her attachment for my physician. He must also be enjoined against attempting to see her or having any contact with her whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle as it pleases me to say it, Doma Ignatia is an ungrateful daughter, and a woman inclined to headstrongness. She cannot be reasoned with in regard to Sanct-Franciscus, and for those reasons, I fear to what excesses she may go if she is not now checked in her wildness. You have it within your power to compel her to submit to wiser minds than hers, and I urge you to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDependant as I am upon Sanct-Franciscus for what little health I now enjoy, I cannot ask you to punish him in any way, for I would surely endure agonies without his help. Once my laughter is forcibly removed from this household, he will have no reason not to resume his customary care of me, without the distraction of my heedless child. I know whatever lapses of conduct he may have committed began with her importunities: he is astute, sympathetic, and dedicated to his work. Once Doma Ignatia is beyond reach, his attention will be all that it ever has been. This is a complete and accurate transcription of the charges made by Egidia Adicia Cortelle, Domina Laelius, so I swear\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalbinus Aranus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escribe of the Prefect of the Curia \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19/page-22.html","bookId":2502,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:44 PM"}
