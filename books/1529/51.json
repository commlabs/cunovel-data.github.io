He stepped over to Seichan\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, 1 got the raw end of this deal,\" Kowalski griped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring him, Vigor pointed to the walls. \"We\u0027ll start along the outer edges. You two do the middle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan climbed onto the altar. \"I can reach the ones above here by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stood, a cross of sunlight lit her back. She had stripped out of her vest and only wore a black T-shirt. Gray noted her curves as she reached up, the stretch of cotton over breast. Despite all his worries, a part of him was still male enough to appreciate it... yet he was still man enough to feel guilty about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow wasn\u0027t the time ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I see a possibility . ..\" Seichan mumbled, extending to her toes, stretching higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she winced and came down on her heels. Her hand cupped her left side. She had strained her wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray climbed up next to her. \"Let me help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered her a leg up, lacing his hands together into a stirrup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the silver crucifix, then stepped into his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he straightened and lifted her, she balanced one hand atop his head and reached the crucifix toward the ceiling. Her left buttock was pressed against his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah, he was going to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think... I think. . .\" Seichan whispered. \"It fits! This mark\u0027s carved deep, and the crucifix snugs right into it. A perfect match!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray craned up, but all he could see were the underside of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell what Christ is staring at?\" he asked, remembering Hagia Sophia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down at the altar,\" she answered, but she seemed distracted. \"The crucifix is seated in a circular block of stone. When I pushed the crucifix in there, I thought I felt something click. And the stone almost seems loose. With the crucifix in place, I think I can turn it. Maybe loosen it free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you should—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a scrape of stone. A loud clank sounded, but it came not from above. Gray stared down between his toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe altar dropped from under his feet, falling straight through the floor, taking Gray with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan tumbled into his arms, hugging tight to his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone slab hit the ground with a jarring impact, dropping Gray to one knee. Dust flumed up. One of the floor bricks broke away, smashed into the altar, and bounced away into the darkness that lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stared up. Though it had scared the breath out of him, they had fallen only four feet. Vigor and Kowalski stared down at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 think you found something, Indiana,\" Kowalski said with a smirk. He passed over a flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray rolled his eyes, but he accepted the flashlight. Seichan climbed off him, dusting herself off. Crouching, Gray pointed his light into the chamber revealed under the chapel. A dark archway beckoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid off the altar stone to the floor, Seichan at his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor and Kowalski climbed down to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo crossed arches formed the roof of a small chamber, half the size of the upper chapel. Lit by his flashlight, a low niche was cut into the back wall, framed in another archway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A loculi,\" Vigor said. \"A tomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the niche, a body lay stretched across the bare stone, covered in folds of white cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kokejin\u0027s tomb,\" Vigor said. \"We found it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the excitement, they approached solemnly. Gray and Vigor stepped up. They needed to be sure. Vigor blessed their trespass with the sign of the cross and a mumbled prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monsignor reached a hand to the burial shroud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If something moves,\" Kowalski whispered, dead serious, \"I\u0027m out of here. Just so you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor ignored him and reverently lifted away a fold of cloth from one end. \"Silk,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust wafted as he pulled it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dome of a skull was revealed. Resting atop it shone a gold headpiece, rubies and sapphires reflected the light. Diamonds glistened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The princess\u0027s headpiece,\" Vigor said in a hushed voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remembered Vigor\u0027s story, how Marco had the headpiece with him at his deathbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor\u0027s hand trembled. \"Marco must have willed that it be returned. Possibly even arranged to have her body removed and secured in secret, before she finally came to her final rest here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray reached out and covered Vigor\u0027s hand with his own. \"The third paitzu . . . the third key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were short on time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray drew the silk shroud away from the rest of the bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor gasped and fell back a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Gray froze, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not just one body beneath all the silk trapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo skeletons lay within the tomb, entwined in each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray recalled Vigor\u0027s story of the Church of San Lorenzo, how Marco Polo was interred there in 1324, but a later renovation revealed the body to be gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t just found Kokejin\u0027s tomb,\" Vigor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray nodded. \"We found Marco Polo\u0027s tomb, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at the entwined pair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the two couldn\u0027t have in life, they had finally achieved in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray wondered if he\u0027d ever find a love that great. It reminded him of his parents, together through so much hardship, struggling through trials of debilitation and now dementia .. . yet they never gave up on each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had to save them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:01 a.m. Washington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter wished he could be on-site, but it would only delay the response team. From Sigma\u0027s com-center, he watched the live video feed. It was broad cast from a helmet camera of one of the strike team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes ago they\u0027d had their first real break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll morning Painter had busted balls to trace the international phone logs from Monsignor Verona\u0027s cell phone back to U.S. shores. Gray had mentioned that Amen Nasser had called Vigor\u0027s phone. To trace that call, Painter had to rattle powers from the Vatican\u0027s curia to Homeland Security\u0027s director of operations. At least with Seichan in tow, he had been able to play the terrorist card. It had opened doors normally closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it took longer than he\u0027d liked, but Painter finally knew from where the call had originated. A strike team waited on his word to begin the assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned to the microphone. \"Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVan doors slid open. The camera feed jittered and jumped. The team closed in from multiple directions, front and rear, running low, assault rifles in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike team hit the building like a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA battering ram smashed the front door open in one swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feed went dark as his cameraman followed the others into the building. The team fanned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to sit any longer, he stood up, leaning his fists on the communication array. Technicians crowded either side, viewing other monitors as satellite feed streamed in from Indonesia. A major storm with hurricane-strength winds blanketed most of their region, hampering the search for the hijacked Mistress of the Seas. The storm also grounded a good number of the search planes out of Australia and Indonesia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lack of progress had boiled up Painter\u0027s frustration. His fear for Lisa, for Monk, had grown close to crippling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the hit on the phone trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed a win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin his earpiece, he heard the chatter of the strike team, crisscrossing reports and call-outs. Finally, one clear voice rang through, coming from the cameraman. He had stopped inside what looked like a meat locker. Hooks hung from the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director Crowe, we\u0027ve completed the sweep of the butcher shop. We\u0027re negative on the targets. The place is deserted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe video jittered as the cameraman bent down—then straightened, lifting his fingers into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, we\u0027ve got blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the technicians glanced in his direction, saw something he didn\u0027t like in Painter\u0027s expression, and quickly turned back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice cut through his despair, coming from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director Crowe . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman stood in the doorway, dressed in navy blues. Her auburn hair was tied away from her face, shining with fear and worry. He understood the haunted look in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kat.. .\" he said, straightening. It was Monk\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My aunt is watching Penelope. I couldn\u0027t just sit at home any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood and lifted an arm. \"We could use your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all they could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep moving, keep fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any way they could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:04 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stared down at the entwined bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco and Kokejin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe discovery still kept him frozen in front of the slab. Others were not as moved. Seichan pushed between Gray and Vigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed an arm. \"The third gold passport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pulled the burial shroud fully aside. Nestled between the bodies, covered by the two skeletal hands, a glint of gold shone past the bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the third paitzu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd resting beside it was a familiar length of bronze tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third and final scroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a reverential gentleness, Gray removed the items. He slipped the headpiece off the skull, too. \"It might bear a clue,\" he justified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor didn\u0027t argue. With the burial chamber opened, it would be quickly stolen if left unattended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all climbed back up into the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce there, they gathered in a corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned over the golden passport to reveal a third angelic glyph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have them all,\" Seichan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not the entire story,\" Gray said. He pulled out his notebook and nodded to Vigor. \"Let\u0027s hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor needed no further prompting. He nicked open the bronze tube and extracted the scroll. \"Silk again,\" he commented, and began unwrapping it with care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last piece of the story was longer, stretching a quarter of the way across the chapel floor. Vigor translated Marco\u0027s Italian dialect. The harrowing tale continued with the appearance of the glowing angelic figures, coming upon Marco\u0027s party trapped inside a tower room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-51.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
