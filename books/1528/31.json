The question, Dr. Masterson, is why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeptember 6, 7:45 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loose ends,” Trent McBride explained. “There are too many of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri saw the man glance in his direction, but he didn’t flinch. Let them kill him. It did not matter. Yuri sat in an office chair. They’d allowed him to dress again after removing the electrodes. His fiery torture had continued for another twenty minutes. Yuri had not held back. He’d divulged much, confessing more details about the genetics of the children, the secret he and Savina had kept from the Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe even admitted why the Russians had not objected to Dr. Archibald Polk’s recruitment. Yuri admitted that Polk had been getting too close to the heart of the genetic secret. Savina had already planned to orchestrate an accident while the man was at the Warren, to silence him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in this game of scientific brinkmanship, neither he nor Savina imagined that Polk’s own colleague and friend would arrange his escape, all to lure one of their children out into the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Savina had taken the bait. She cared little that Polk had escaped with the skull, which McBride had given him. It was the genetic secret he held that had panicked Savina into sending Yuri and Sasha into the hunt for the man. She had fallen cleanly into the American’s trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loose ends?” Mapplethorpe asked, drawing back his attention. He shook his head, unconcerned. “I see only three. The girl, the skull, and Polk’s trail in India. The last is already being handled. And I’ve heard rumblings through intelligence channels that our missing skull might mysteriously turn up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you manage that?” McBride asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get waters boiling just right, and you’ll be surprised what will come to the surface.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri paid more attention. Mapplethorpe’s gaze flicked to him. Yuri knew the only reason he was still alive was because of Sasha. Mapplethorpe needed him, knew about her medical condition, about a problem seen in all the children. The stress of the mental manipulation was not without physical consequences to the subjects. In fact, few lived far into their twenties, especially those with the most savant talent. It was a problem that required harvesting eggs and sperm to keep the strongest genetic line viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMapplethorpe sighed. “We should have the girl before the sun sets…if not sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you’ll still be too late, Yuri thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo simple these Americans, so quick to assume that what was tortured testimony was the whole story. While Yuri had not lied, he had committed one sin: a sin of omission. In fact, McBride hadn’t even known the question to ask, so secure was he in his superiority and his sadistic trust in the power of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri kept his face stoic. They sought to break him with their tortures, but he was an old man, one used to keeping secrets. All they’d accomplished was to harden his core for what was to come. In the past months, Yuri had started to have reservations about Savina’s plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillions would die in horrible ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll for a new world to be born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new Renaissance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri stared at Mapplethorpe’s self-satisfied smirk and at McBride’s bright-eyed confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll hesitation died inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavina was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time for the world to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:55 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern Ural Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral-Major Savina Martov knew something was wrong. She felt it in her bones, a nonspecific anxiety. She could no longer remain in her office. She needed reassurances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a radio held to the side of her face, she led two soldiers through the dark and abandoned streets that cut through the old Soviet-era apartments that filled the back half of the Chelyabinsk 88 cavern. The featureless concrete blocks that rose to either side were the original housing for prisoners who worked the mines and refinement plants. The men had traded life sentences in the gulags for five years’ work here. Not that any of them ever saw that fifth year. Most died from radiation before the end of their first year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA foolish gamble, but then again, hope could turn any rational man desperate. This was the legacy she had inherited. It served as a reminder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers thought her cruel, but sometimes necessity could wear no other face. The children were well fed, their needs attended. Pain was minimized as much as humanly possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruelty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared around at the hollow-eyed apartments, cold, dark, haunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll she saw was necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio fritzed at her ear as Lieutenant Borsakov came back online. So far she had heard only negative reports from the second in command. He was still searching the surrounding mountains and foothills for the children. He’d been led astray by several false trails, discovering a discarded hospital shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We found two dead dogs,” Borsakov said. “By the river. They’d been torn to shreds. Bear attack. But we’ve picked up a strong trail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what about the cats?” she asked, speaking into a radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence stretched for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lieutenant,” she said more firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were holding off sending them until we had a clear trail. Didn’t want to risk the dogs with the tigers ranging the hills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his voice practical, but Savina recognized the strained edge behind his words. The lieutenant was not so much concerned with the dogs as he was the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did she always have to be the hard one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke crisply. “You have a strong trail now, do you not, Lieutenant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, General-Major.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then do not disappoint me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, General-Major.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clicked off the line. She may have been harsher than she intended, but she’d already heard disturbing news in the past hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA maintenance worker from the neighboring town of Ozyorsk had discovered one of the Warren’s decommissioned trucks, one once used to transport waste from a uranium enrichment plant near the shore of Lake Karachay. Inside, the worker had found a fake badge with Dr. Archibald Polk’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt answered the mystery of the professor’s escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d had help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it didn’t take much contemplation to figure out who had assisted in his escape. It had to be Dr. Trent McBride. What game were the Americans playing? With Yuri’s continuing silence, she could only imagine that he and the girl had been captured. In fact, the escape might have been staged to accomplish just that end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, Savina had to respect McBride for such an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike her, he understood necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, she should have never engaged in a partnership with the United States. But she’d had little choice at the time. In the turmoil following the breakup of the Soviet Union, her project had lost all funding. It was only through such a union that her work was allowed to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States supplied the interim cash, seeking new ways to expand their ability to gather intelligence. Her project offered such a promise. But her project also offered one thing more. She supplied the American government with plausible deniability, similar to the secret CIA-financed torture camps in Europe. In this new world, the lines of acceptable conduct—whether military or scientific—had become blurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot on our soil was the new American credo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she’d been happy at the time to exploit that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the loss of Yuri and the child was not insurmountable. It only required accelerating her timetable. Her operation—titled Saturn—was supposed to follow Nicolas’s actions in Chernobyl by a week. Now the two would commence on the same day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two operations—Uranus and Saturn—were named after two strategic offenses during World War II, when Soviet forces defeated the Germans in the Battle of Stalingrad, the bloodiest battle in human history. Close to two million were killed in that battle, including vast numbers of civilian casualties. Still, the Germans’ defeat was considered the turning point of the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glorious victory for the Motherland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as in the past, Operation Uranus and Saturn would once again free Russia and change the course of world history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd likewise, not without casualties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNecessity was a cruel master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavina reached the far wall of the cavern. A tunnel opened, framed by thick lead blast doors, miniature versions of the same doors that closed the main tunnel into Chelyabinsk 88.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust inside the mouth of the tunnel rested a train and bumper stops. The electrified tracks carried a single train back and forth between the Warren and the heart of Operation Saturn, on the far side of Lake Karachay. The old tunnel went under the toxic lake, allowing for fast transport between the two sites without risk of exposure to the lake’s hot radiological soup of strontium 90 and cesium 137.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train was already waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavina climbed into one of the lead-lined cabs. There were only two enclosed cars, one on either end of the train. The remaining four sections were open ore cars for hauling supplies, mining gear, and rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the train sidled out with a clack of wheels and sizzle of electricity, the blast doors sealed behind her. The tunnel went dark. She stared up as the train began the five-minute journey. As it accelerated, Savina pictured the weight of water overhead, insulated by a quarter mile of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe region above was the heart of the Soviet Union’s uranium and plutonium production. Mostly now defunct, the facility had once had seven active plutonium production reactors and three plutonium separation plants. It was all sloppily run. Since 1948, the production facilities had leaked five times more radiation than Chernobyl and all of the world’s atmospheric nuclear tests combined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd half that radiation was still stored in Lake Karachay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radiation level on the lake’s shore measured six hundred roentgens per hour. Sufficient to deliver a lethal dose in one hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavina remembered where the maintenance worker from Ozyorsk had found Dr. Archibald Polk’s abandoned truck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-31.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
