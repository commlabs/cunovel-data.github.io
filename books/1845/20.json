The woman was so strikingly beautiful, Brenna blinked twice, thinking she might be a vision sent to comfort her through this nightmare. The woman didn\u0027t disappear. She wasn\u0027t just beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was courageous as well because she willingly walked across the hall to speak to Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaird Kincaid\u0027s reaction to the vision was a miracle. His voice turned into velvet when he granted the woman permission to come forward. He even smiled as he leaned down to listen to her. Saints be praised, he was human after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the miracle wasn\u0027t long-lasting. Brenna stared at the vision, who bowed to them and took her leave. Brenna knew it was rude to stare, but she couldn\u0027t seem to stop, until she began to feel as attractive as last week\u0027s leftovers. Alec must think Connor was out of his mind to have married Brenna when he could have chosen one of these Highland beauties. They probably grew like heather around here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor, is your woman timid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" he allowed, wondering what his brother\u0027s game was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to ask you a few questions, Lady Brenna. I expect you to be truthful in your replies. You have nothing to fear from me. Did you ask my brother to marry you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really was going to kill Connor. How dare he tell Alec about her childish embarrassment. Granted, he had forewarned her, but she hadn\u0027t believed him because she was certain he would find it as embarrassing as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Laird. I did ask him to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have something more to say to me?\" he asked, thinking she would surely explain why she\u0027d done such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say it then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not timid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came close to smiling. There had been a definite note of defiance in her voice when she\u0027d defended herself. Perhaps she wasn\u0027t such a mouse after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were mistaken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ask Connor before you were promised to MacNare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, we\u0027ve been over this,\" Connor interjected. \"As I\u0027ve explained several times now, she asked me three times. Now let it go,\" he added as he gently pushed his wife behind his back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree times? He had to mention all the details, didn\u0027t he? She suddenly found herself wondering how timid Alec would think she was if he watched her throttle her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decide when I\u0027ve heard enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She belongs to me now,\" Connor replied\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She could still be given to MacNare. Don\u0027t push me again, brother. You won\u0027t like the consequences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our wedding was blessed. Brenna, stop pushing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything can be undone,\" said Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t go against our church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I won\u0027t,\" Alec conceded. \"There is another way I could give her to MacNare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She could even now be carrying my child. Damn it, wife, will you stop trying to provoke me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can still be free of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor was about to scoff at his brother\u0027s threat when his wife got his attention. She was suddenly standing in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not kill him,\" she shouted at Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer anger caught both men by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Brenna,\" Connor muttered as he moved her behind his back again. \"Stay out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her speak, Connor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was already standing in front of her husband by the time Alec finished giving his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t I kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a good reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t think of one. \"You have to make the best of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec leaned back against the table, folded his arms across his chest, and stared at her. \"The best of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor. I understand why you want to kill him. Most everyone who meets him eventually feels that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he\u0027s your brother, and if you\u0027ll only think about his virtues, you\u0027ll surely let him live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name his virtues?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just knew you were going to say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she\u0027d blurted out her thought as soon as the words were out of her mouth, and she hurried on before Connor took offense. \"He has hundreds of virtues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s loyal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threaded her fingers through her hair in agitation while she concentrated on trying to come up with another one. \"His men seem to like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has gone far enough, Alec. Brenna, if you continue to defend me, my brother will have me tortured before he kills me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing the best I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec abruptly ended the inquisition by leaving the hall. It was apparent Connor had gotten his manners from his older brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell just came over you, Brenna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came over me,\" she cried out. \"You\u0027ve turned me into a raving simpleton. I want to go home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t leave until Alec comes back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t kill you, will he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he won\u0027t kill me. I didn\u0027t realize you cared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter in his voice set her off. \"I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you try to defend me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have to turn logical on her. \"If anyone kills you, it\u0027s going to be me, and I swear to God that if you try to shove me behind you again, I will. Do you have any?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Virtues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pleasant enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was told not to lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I let you voice your opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t a virtue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally took mercy on her. \"It\u0027s over now. I told you he wouldn\u0027t hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t sufficient warning,\" she snapped. \"He\u0027s coming back,\" she added in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec wasn\u0027t alone. The vision followed her laird into the hall and waited by his side when he ordered Brenna to come to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor had to nudge Brenna to get her started. She walked over to the laird, bowed her head, and waited for him to scare the hell out of her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to the family, Lady Brenna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie insisted they stay for supper so she could have a nice long visit with Brenna. Connor insisted they leave. Alec wasn\u0027t about to let his wife be disappointed, however. He ended the discussion by turning the invitation into a command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one bothered to ask Brenna how she felt about it. She was hungry, of course—she always was—but she wasn\u0027t about to eat anything at all in front of relatives she wanted to impress. She might do something horrid like spill her drink or eat too much once she got started, and God only knew what they would think of her then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d moved close to Connor\u0027s side during the long-winded debate, but didn\u0027t realize she\u0027d taken hold of his hand until he had to help her let go of him so he could follow his brother outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he leaned down toward her, she assumed he wanted to kiss her before he took his leave. Her father had often done that when he left his wife\u0027s side, and Brenna was so appreciative that Connor was finally going to be thoughtful, she decided to beat him to the task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t expect it. Before he even had a glimmer of her intentions, her mouth touched his for a second or two, and she was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked damned pleased with herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked thunderstruck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t make an issue of her behavior, and while he found it puzzling that she didn\u0027t seem to understand what was appropriate and what wasn\u0027t, he had to admit it didn\u0027t bother him all that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now will you let go of my hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as he requested and clasped her hands behind her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had already reached the top of the steps and was staring at the tapestry hanging over the mantle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on his face wasn\u0027t at all pleasant. Thankfully, his irritation seemed to be directed toward his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think I wouldn\u0027t notice, Jamie?\" He sounded furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie didn\u0027t look any worse for wear, though. She frowned at her husband and called out, \"Think I wouldn\u0027t notice my beloved William hanging in the stables?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor nudged Brenna to get her attention, told her to stay out of trouble, and followed his brother outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie excused herself a minute later. \"Please make yourself comfortable while I go and have a word with cook about the preparations. We\u0027ll eat an hour earlier than usual so you can be home well before dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll hurry back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute Brenna was alone, she frantically tried to make herself more presentable. She brushed the dust off her clothes, adjusted the pleats of her plaid, shoved her hair back over her shoulders, and pinched some color into her cheeks. Unfortunately, once she was finished, she suspected she didn\u0027t look any better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished she didn\u0027t feel so nervous and unsure of herself. She blamed her condition on Alec Kincaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, her hands were still shaking from her introduction to Connor\u0027s brother, and how in heaven\u0027s name was she ever going to be able to sit down at the same table with the man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to draw any attention to herself. She was determined not to make any mistakes or talk about anything one of them might take exception to, and so she listed all the subjects she mustn\u0027t bring up. England came to mind first. Alec and Jamie probably felt the same way Connor did about her beloved country, which meant they detested it, and even though she thought such an opinion was both ignorant and foolish, she wasn\u0027t about to get into an argument with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe list of topics she must avoid went on and on, and it didn\u0027t take her long to realize the only safe subject left was the weather. She wanted to be perfect, knew it wasn\u0027t possible, and finally concluded her only course of action was to keep her mouth shut, her hands folded in her lap, and to speak only when she was asked a specific question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would also avoid standing or sitting near Jamie. Connor and Alec were bound to notice how ordinary she was in comparison to Jamie\u0027s flawlessness. Why, Alec\u0027s wife was even more beautiful than Rachel, and Brenna hadn\u0027t thought such a thing was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted her new relatives to believe she was worthy of Connor. She didn\u0027t understand why their acceptance was so important, and if she weren\u0027t feeling like such a nervous twit at the moment, she was sure she would be able to reason it all out. Up until the minute she\u0027d walked into the Kincaid home, she\u0027d believed a goat would have been worthy enough for her husband, but she doubted Alec and Jamie would appreciate hearing that opinion. They probably liked their brother, and Brenna wanted them to like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in need of a friend to talk to, and there had been such kindness and warmth in Jamie\u0027s eyes, Brenna knew she would be a good ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling inadequate made her miserable. Brenna had been taught to count her blessings and not her sorrows, and so she reminded herself of all the wondrous gifts God had bestowed on her. She had good, straight teeth, a strong back, and feet that never, ever pained her. Those were all fine assets indeed, but far more important than any physical attributes were the hidden treasures she possessed. Her mother had often told her she had a good heart. She was also a hard worker. She used to have a strong mind too, until Connor came along and turned her into a babbling half-wit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps she wasn\u0027t completely hopeless, after all. Besides, she had a sound plan now, and that made her feel more in control. As long as she remembered to be quiet and demure, she would do just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith any luck, no one would even notice she was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked about the hall with interest. Her attention was immediately drawn to the huge tapestry hanging over the mantle. She stared at it a long while, trying to figure out what had bothered Alec so much when he\u0027d looked at it. She thought the piece was lovely. Its edges were frayed with age, but the threads were still vibrant with color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepicted was the likeness of a man Alec had called William, dressed in a deep royal blue robe and wearing a jeweled crown on his head, who seemed to be looking across the hall. She didn\u0027t know who William was, but she decided he must have lived a long time ago because there was a gold halo over his head, which meant he\u0027d already been sainted. She really should have taken the time to memorize all the names and pertinent facts about the saints as her confessor had suggested, she realized, and wouldn\u0027t he be gloating now if he knew she was sorry she hadn\u0027t paid attention to his lectures? Although she was curious to find out which William it was, she wasn\u0027t going to ask Alec or Jamie to tell her, for fear they\u0027d think she was ignorant. She would have to wait until later and put the question to Connor. She made the sign of the cross to show her respect for the saint before turning her back on him so she could look at the rest of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was immediately captivated by the arsenal hanging on the walls on either side of the entrance. In the center of the larger wall were two magnificent swords with golden handles encrusted with jewels. The larger one had a jewel missing near the center of the cluster of gems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all very impressive, she supposed, but downright peculiar too. Why would anyone want to hang their weapons in their home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door opened behind the balcony above the main entrance, and a little girl no bigger than a whisper came hurrying out. The child had obviously just awakened from her nap, as she was rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She was dressed in an ivory gown and had wrapped herself in a plaid that dragged on the floor around her. The little girl was in such a hurry to get downstairs, she forgot to hold the blanket away from her feet as she walked across the balcony. She had already stumbled once when Brenna started toward her to lend a helping hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna started running when the little one tripped a second time. \"Pick up your plaid and wait for me to help you down the stairs,\" she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t understand what Brenna was telling her. She didn\u0027t seem to be afraid of the stranger, just curious. She stared down at Brenna between the rails and smiled, but didn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, Brenna realized her mistake in calling out to the child, because now the little one was busy watching her and wasn\u0027t paying any attention to where she was going. The child was headed for disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna started running up the steps to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t make it. The little girl reached the edge of the top step, tripped on her blanket, and catapulted herself into the air with the force of a pebble hurled from a sling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-20.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM"}
