Light help us . . . it’s going to get worse\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 33\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prince’s Tabac\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin chased Slayer through the skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaped from a churning, silver-black cloud, Slayer a blur before him in the charred sky. The air pulsed with the rhythm of lightning bolts and furious winds. Scent after scent assailed Perrin, with no logic behind them. Mud in Tear. A burning pie. Rotting garbage. A death-lily flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer landed on the cloud ahead and shifted, turning around in an eye-blink, bow drawn. The arrow loosed so quickly the air cracked, but Perrin managed to slap it down with his hammer. He landed on the same thunder-head as Slayer, imagining footing beneath him, and the vapors of the storm cloud became solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin charged forward through a churning dark gray fog, the top layer of the cloud, and attacked. They clashed, Slayer summoning a shield and sword. Perrin\u0027s hammer beat a rhythm against that shield, pounding alongside the booming of thunder. A crash with each blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer spun away to flee, but Perrin managed to snatch the edge of his cloak. As Slayer attempted to shift away, Perrin imagined them staying put. He knew they would. It was not a possibility, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both fuzzed for a moment, then returned to the cloud. Slayer growled, then swept his sword backward, shearing off the tip of his cloak and freeing himself. He turned to face Perrin, stalking to the side, sword held in wary hands. The cloud trembled beneath them, and a flash of phantom lightning lit the misty vapor at their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You become increasingly annoying, wolf pup\", Slayer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’ve never fought a wolf that can fight you back\", Perrin said. \"You’ve killed them from afar. The slaughter was easy. Now you’ve tried to hunt a prey who has teeth, Slayer\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer snorted. \"You’re like a boy with his father’s sword. Dangerous, but completely unaware of why, or how to use your weapons\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’ll see who—\" Perrin began, but Slayer lunged, sword out. Perrin braced himself, imagining the sword growing dull, the air becoming thick to slow it, his skin turning hard enough to turn the weapon aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later, Perrin found himself tumbling through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFool! he thought. He’d focused so much on the attack that he hadn’t been ready when Slayer changed their footing. Perrin passed through the rumbling cloud, breaking out into the sky below, wind tugging at his clothing. He prepared himself, waiting for the hail of arrows to follow him down out of the cloud. Slayer could be so predictable . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo arrows came. Perrin fell for a few moments, then cursed and twisted to see a storm of arrows shooting up from the ground below. He shifted seconds before they passed through where he’d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin appeared in the air a hundred feet to the side, still falling. He didn’t bother to slow himself; he hit the ground, increasing his body’s strength to deal with the shock of the blow. The ground cracked. A ring of dust blew out from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm was far worse than it had been. The ground here—they were in the south, somewhere, with overgrown brush and tangled vines growing up the sides of the trees—was pocked and torn. Lightning lashed repeatedly, so frequent that he could hardly count to three without seeing a bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no rain, but the landscape crumbled. Entire hills would suddenly disintegrate. The one just to Perrin’s left dissolved like an enormous pile of dust, a trail of dirt and sand streaking out into the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin leaped through the debris-laden sky, hunting Slayer. Had the man shifted back up to Shayol Ghul? No. Two more arrows pierced the sky, heading for Perrin. Slayer was very good at making them ignore the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin slapped the arrows aside and hurled himself in Slayer’s direction. He spotted the man on a peak of rock, ground crumbling to either side of him and whipping into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin came down with hammer swinging. Slayer shifted away, of course, and the hammer struck stone with a sound like thunder. Perrin growled. Slayer was too quick!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin was fast, too. Sooner or later, one of them would slip. One slip would be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught sight of Slayer bounding away, and followed. When Perrin jumped off the next hilltop, the stones shattered behind him, rising up into the wind. The Pattern was weakening. Beyond that, his will was much stronger now that he was here in the flesh. He no longer had to worry about entering the dream too strongly and losing himself. He had entered it as strongly as one could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, when Perrin moved, the landscape shuddered around him. The next leap showed him sea ahead. They had traveled much farther to the south than Perrin had realized. Were they in Illian? Tear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer hit the beach, where water crashed against rocks; the sand—if there had been any—had been blown away. The land seemed to be returning to a primal state, grass ripped free, soil eroded, leaving only stone and crashing waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin landed beside Slayer. For once, there was no shifting. Both men were intent on the fight, the swings of hammer and sword. Metal clanged against metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin nearly landed a hit, his hammer brushing Slayer’s clothing. He heard a curse, but the next moment, Slayer was rounding from his dodge with a large axe in hand. Perrin braced himself and took it on the side, hardening his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe axe didn’t draw blood, not with Perrin braced as he was, but it did carry a huge amount of force behind it. The blow tossed Perrin out over the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer appeared above him a second later, plunging down with that axe. Perrin caught it on his hammer as he fell, but the force of the blow flung him downward, toward the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe commanded the water to recede. It rushed away, churning and bubbling, as if pursued by a powerful wind. Perrin righted himself as he fell, landing and cracking the still-wet, rocky bottom of the bay. Seawater rose high to either side of him, a circular wall some thirty feet high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer crashed down nearby. The man was panting from the exertion of their fight. Good. Perrin’s own fatigue manifested as a deep burning in his muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m glad you were there\", Slayer said, raising his sword to his shoulder, his shield vanishing. \"I had so hoped that, when I appeared to kill the Dragon, y \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-191.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
