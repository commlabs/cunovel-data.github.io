I can\u0027t do it again. I want to run. I need air. I need to feel the Michigan air against my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw open the door and take a step outside when a voice, amplified through the speakers, stops me in my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not a good idea,\" he says into the microphone. I recognize his voice, and that repetitive phrase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly turn around and face the stage. Will is standing there, holding the microphone between his hands, looking directly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t leave before you get your scores,\" he says as he motions to the judges table. I follow his gaze to the judges who are all turned around in their seats. All four of them have their eyes locked on me; the fifth seat is empty. I gasp as I realize Will was the fifth judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he saw me. He watched me do my piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sense that I\u0027m floating again as I make my way to the center of the room. Everyone is quiet. I look around and all eyes are on me. No one understands what\u0027s happening. I\u0027m not so sure I even understand what\u0027s happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks at the emcee standing next to him. \"I\u0027d like to perform a piece.

Will turns back to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three dollars,\" someone yells from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill darts a look at the emcee. \"I don\u0027t have any cash,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately pull the two dollars in change out of my pocket and run to the stage, smacking it down in front of the emcees feet. He inspects the money I laid before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still a dollar short,\" the emcee says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence in the room is interrupted as several chairs slide from under their tables. There is a faint rumble as people walk toward me. I\u0027m surrounded, being pushed and shoved in different directions as the crowd grows thicker. It begins to disperse just as fast and the silence slowly returns as everyone makes their way back to their seats. I return my gaze to the stage, where dozens of dollar bills are haphazardly thrown at the emcees feet. My eyes follow along as a quarter rolls off the edge of the stage and falls onto the floor. It wiggles and spins as it comes to rest at my foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emcee is focused on the pile of money before him. \"Okay,\" he says. \"I guess that covers it. What\u0027s the name of your piece, Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill brings the microphone to his mouth and finds me in the crowd. \"Better than third,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met a girl in a U-Haul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beautiful girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I fell for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, sometimes life gets in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife definitely got in my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got all up in my damn way,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife blocked the door with a stack of wooden 2x4\u0027s nailed together and attached to a fifteen inch concrete wall behind a row of solid steel bars, bolted to a titanium frame that no matter how hard I shoved against it-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewouldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes life doesn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just gets all up in your damn way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt blocked my plans, my dreams, my desires, my wishes, my wants, my needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt blocked out that beautiful girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I fell so hard for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife tries to tell you what\u0027s best for you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should be most important to you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should come in first\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr second\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried so hard to keep it all organized, alphabetized, stacked in chronological order, everything in its perfect space, its perfect place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought that\u0027s what life wanted me to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what life needed for me to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep it all in sequence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, life gets in your way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gets all up in your damn way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it doesn\u0027t get all up in your damn way because it wants you to just give up and let it take control.
