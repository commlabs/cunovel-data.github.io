Maybe at one time I\u0027d been, but no more. Life had taught me that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Caleb... what can you do?\" he chuckled, his arrogance forcing his agreement. Turning away I hid a smile that Gramps caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the side of his swollen lip. \"That\u0027s my boy,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned suddenly and Parker nodded. He knew more than he was letting on. But, I knew that somehow, this whole thing had been predestined. That I had to just do whatever seemed right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty easy, that\u0027s just the way I rolled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes fixed on the Null, Jabez. He\u0027d be the first to go. Without the dead, I didn\u0027t have any chance. None.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe auctioneer came to stand by the girls. He gripped the sides of a makeshift podium and slammed a gavel against the surface. The girls jumped. Tiff cringed. Randi had started to become more awake, the sedative wearing off. That was gonna be critical. We weren\u0027t escaping this mess without her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have the first bid?\" a man from the mass of fragment asked, standing head and shoulders above the others. As I studied him, I noted he looked vaguely like the guys of the Band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jade again, clenching my eyes shut then opening them, little more than a long blink of agony. I could feel the hands of the fragment hanging on to my arms. I was stuck. But not for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chorus of voices rose from the crowd and then the question I\u0027d been dreading was asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much for the untried?\" Their eyes roamed our girls hungrily. But one girl had caught his eye and he approached the platform. He was big and tall, my height, his chin coming to the platform\u0027s edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed and Sophie gazed at me with naked fear in her face. Hang on, my face said, hang on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay back,\" a fragment guard growled from the corner of the platform. The male\u0027s eyes flicked over the bare wood then back to the girl he had his eyes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my eyes again so I could expunge the image of him looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t wait another second. Who I was rebelled against everything that I could see, hear, touch... feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like food poisoning but worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircumstance poisoning. And I had the cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes they locked onto Sophie and I screamed in a focused yell, \"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Zondorae jerked his head in my direction and Parker threw the vial with the partial antidote in it. It spun toward me in a lazy arc, catching the sun as it did, the amber-colored liquid sloshing as it approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the brothers screaming as my peripheral vision caught Parker jerking his fist in accomplishment, a look of fierce joy on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t going to make it in time! I flung myself outward, startling the fragment guards that had loosened their clasp on my shoulders. I grabbed it in midair and was gone before I fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the planks of the platform, Sophie having torn me through realm and deposited me in a neat pile, fifteen meters from where I\u0027d just been standing. I stood up and realized I had two seconds to execute The Plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jammed the vial in my pocket and stabbed out my hand with all the precision I\u0027d been taught, my training in judo as automatic as breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI aimed for the back of Jabez the Null\u0027s head and he went down, slumping forward, boneless and unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fragment came for me, leaping up the sides of the platform, taking the steps three at a time. I saw Sophie was still in realm, hanging limply against the bindings, having sacrificed her travel to get me the necessary distance to where I stood now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the unconscious body of Jabez the Null who could no longer derail my power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fragment swooped in and I lurched forward as I bellowed a call to the dead that rippled like a shouted plea underneath still water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tidal wave of death responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground rippled underneath the platform, the wood undulating like a poked snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands broke through the wood and sought who came for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first break of the day. The dumbass fragment had built their stage of illegal trade on top of an old burial site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin of pure malice stole over my face as the first of them came through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Red Men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was the most unpolitically correct thought but I let it take form anyway: I loved the Indians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFully armed and ready to do battle for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Howie said the one word that made everything halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" he roared at me and I stood stockstill, the death energy choking me like a silken noose, not fully eclipsed in its command. I stood while the fragment made their way between zombies held in thrall by my unfinished directive. My paralyzed eyes held frozen in my skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his command had been for me and me alone. It was unshakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbreakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear and misery seized me. To have come this far to saving the whole thing... to be stopped by dumbass Frazier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy came up and clocked Frazier in the back of the head with a rock the size of his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot damn! That felt great!\" he screamed and ran as the fragment poured after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy could run like the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker met my eyes. He opened his mouth and breathed out toward my zombies. \"Live,\" he said quietly, his soft utterance caused their eyes to fill out in their heads like plump grapes that were once raisins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurpose and intent stood where nothingness had been a moment before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrazier was unconscious and I was back in business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brothers backed up but I looked at the Red Man that was closest. I was definitely a follow-through kinda guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew the Indians were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get them,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t ask who but flew toward the brothers, his weapons ready, the war cry shrill, shattering the silence as the birds left their roost from the safety of the nearby trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA call so unnatural it scared every living animal that was close. Even the bugs moved through the grass like slow-moving brackish water, weaving between the grass turned green by late summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran after the Chief of the Red Men before he split the skull of the brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the hardest restraints I\u0027d ever imposed on myself. I was almost proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there was the small detail of blood collection. That old expression that Gramps used, you can\u0027t get blood out of a turnip. Well, I was going to apply it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0027t get blood outta a corpse either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubdue, I thought at him in a hard command through our conduit of death. He staggered a step as he neared them, then regained his balance, moving forward again he twirled the tomahawk held fast in his muscular grip, the blade glinting as it spun. He never hesitated, bringing the blunt end down with smooth precision on Joe\u0027s head, a light skull tap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a surprised \"O\" with his mouth and slumped. The Indian caught him and rolled him with finesse as additional warriors surged forward, clamping on to Gary\u0027s arms, they dragged him to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as an especially enthusiastic Indian began to pound his face into the fragrant earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably trying to get to those brains, I thought. The first real smile of the day touched my lips briefly, then disappeared as I spoke to the Enthusiast, \"No head-banging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Clyde wading into a small knot of fragment that had surrounded the guys and he said, with characteristic Clyde Charm, \"Cease and desist, vermin, or it shall be your last thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t know Clyde was dead, they just thought he was a smart ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were right, in his way, Clyde was The Smartest Ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was also quite dead. Strong, vital, lightning fast... and without mercy in the right circumstance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat circumstance was now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex saw him move through them like a tsunami finding its perfect island to ravage. He followed suit and between the two of them, they delivered the pounding of the century to men that deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Js sprinted to the platform as the foreign fragment, a riot in mind, went to loot the girls from underneath the domestic fragment\u0027s nose. They ignored the threat of the Indians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad move. I watched as they came to realize the error of their ways, the Indians began to latch onto the clothing of each fragment that came, pitching them into each other, trees, whatever was standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, with what seemed like hours but was really minutes, nothing was standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned their eyes to mine as Jabez the Null began to stir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned a frantic look at him, realizing his consciousness would start the whole ugly ball rolling down the mountain of shit again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his eyes found mine he opened his mouth to speak and the Chief grabbed the back of his head by hair that was fashionably long by this world\u0027s standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scalped him where he lay. The hair tore away like a stubborn velcro strip, the baldness of his scalp stood like a poached egg, white for the moment, filling in with red as I watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief met my eyes and seeing no dissent, ran the small blade he had in his free hand, the tendons and muscles flexed like tight cords swiping along the flesh of the throat of Jabez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSevering his vocal cords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t be shutting down the dead any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary Zondorae was bellowing at the Indians that held him as I moved slowly toward him and I took note of the Js untying the girls. Finally frustrated, John used one of the tomahawks to cut the ties at the girls\u0027 feet. Mia\u0027s eyes widened at this but once she was free, Bry was there and they fell into each others arms. He stroked her dark honey-colored hair while she sobbed in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHated the hospitality here, I had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved between fragment that backed away as I came. They knew what I was now, what I\u0027d called. My eyes met Parker\u0027s and I jerked the vial and the collector out of my filthy jeans, the metal button long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary saw them in my hand and smiled. \"You can\u0027t undo what we\u0027ve accomplished here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"You\u0027re right. But I can save my friends, and I\u0027m not done by half... with what I plan to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker smiled, nodding. Zondorae looked at him. \"He\u0027s not some messiah, Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeffrey Parker shook his head. \"We don\u0027t need one. He is the one that wanted to do the right thing, could do it. You\u0027re done here. And you\u0027re done there as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both knew that he was talking about my world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had paranormals now too. The future uncertain. But what I could change for the future, I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Indians held Gary, who wouldn\u0027t stop screaming, the Indian who was closest raised the blunt hilt of his small dagger and Gary shut his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pierced the collector into his skin, twisting it as I did. He flinched and I watched the opaque collector, the size of the now-defunct fifty cent pieces, fill with wine-colored blood. Hitting the air it looked red, but without oxygen it ran blue in the veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee, I hadn\u0027t totally flunked Biology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes bulged as Parker extracted an eye dropper type gizmo and we mixed his blood with the antidote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was disgusting but necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to Jade who was thrashing in Brett\u0027s grip, his face a tight mask of pain. She saw me come and started screaming for me to get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stride faltered but then I took a deep breath and kept coming. I reminded myself that I\u0027d get my girl back when she had the antidote inside of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett met my eyes. \"Does this mean she\u0027s going back to you, Hart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that matter?\" I yelled. \"Look at her!\" I said, flinging my hand at Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker came forward. \"Do it, Caleb, before it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed the stopper at the ground, close to my body like it was worth a billion bucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I gazed into her face, I knew it was worth that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held her still, her eyes wide with irrational fear, seeing and hearing things only she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA face I\u0027d held with passion, with care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA face I now held in a crushing grip she couldn\u0027t escape. I pressed against the side of her jaw and as tears streamed down her cheeks Parker moved in and pinched her nose, her mouth popped open and her tongue rose to the roof of her mouth to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glittering jewel-like amber drop hung suspended above those lips I\u0027d kissed. Tremulously it held, then with exquisite slowness it fell, landing right underneath her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of her face, her accusing eyes locking on me, the stare one I\u0027d hoped never to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHate and revulsion shone in that gaze. I closed my eyes against it, standing and turning as I moved away to give the drop to my infected friends, leaving Jade in the arms of Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do wish to depart this world of ill repute,\" Clyde said in his matter-of-fact way, folding his arms across a suit that had to be the-seven-shades-of-hell-hot. Bobbi Gale linked her arm through his and grinned at his summation of the wonderful parallel world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-31.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
