Maia Lee stepped down from the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said. \"I must admit you do this rather well. I haven\u0027t fallen asleep either time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d succumbed to the Texas summer—abandoning her business attire in favour of walking shorts, tank top, sandals. Her hair fell loose around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The teaching career that might have been,\" I lamented. \"Had I not been stolen out of the warm bosom of Academia by a certain lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were in the warm bosom of a bartending job,\" Maia reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technicalities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I suppose I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked across campus together—under the shadow of the clock tower, through the South Mall. The distribution boxes for the Daily Texan and the Austin Chronicle had been filled with new issues, both carrying lead stories about the family scandal that had recently rocked Doebler Oil—the discovery of an heir the family had shuffled aside, apparently because they didn\u0027t like his Latino father. The Chronicles cover featured a huge closecropped photo of W.B. Doebler\u0027s face, with the title: \"Oil or Slime?\" I promised myself I\u0027d stop by the Met Club later, get W.B. to autograph a copy for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia and I walked down the red granite steps that rounded the side of the Poseidon fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Pena was waiting for us at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in a wheelchair, his lower half swathed in a crinkly black blanket. His face looked sunburned, as if he\u0027d fallen asleep under a heat lamp. His moustache and goatee had started to spread into a full beard. It looked like he\u0027d actually gained weight from his week in the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, at the curb, a milky green Lexus was idling. A young Asian chauffeur was talking into a cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew and I shook hands unenthusiastically. Then Maia offered hers and Matthew clasped it. Maia sat on the granite lip of the fountain, her knees a few inches from the wheels of Pena\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I leave at one o\u0027clock,\" Matthew said. \"You have an answer for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor give you a prognosis?\" Maia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena rubbed his fingers against the chrome of his armrests. \"Does it matter for your decision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s too soon to tell. I still have no feeling in my right leg. This morning I had a slight tingle in my left. The doctors say that\u0027s a good sign, but they don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll start physical therapy as soon as I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did a pretty good job suppressing the fear in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Encouraging,\" Maia said. \"But my answer is no, Matthew. I can\u0027t work for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face paled in a slow wash, like wet sand around a footprint. \"I have leverage with Ron Terrence. If you won\u0027t work for me directly, I can get you your old job back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Matthew. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could do very well as my lawyer. You could make millions in a very short time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I could. The answer is still no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I thought as much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck, though, Matthew. I wish you well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pursed his lips. \"I\u0027m sure you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross 24th Street, the church bells of University Christian started clanging. A line of startled pigeons rose in a bluegray arc, only to settle again half a block down by the eggroll vendor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena gave me a sour smile. \"This must be satisfying, Navarre— seeing me in a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Maia tell me no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should apologize to you. Part of me wants to. Unfortunately, most of me wants you to rot in hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not sure which part of you I like better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked satisfied with that reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to us, water cascaded down the front of Poseidon\u0027s patinaed team of horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street, the doors of the church opened and weddinggoers in tuxedos and dresses poured out. I realized it was the third wedding I\u0027d seen since coming to Austin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I remembered it was June. This was supposed to be a month for weddings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople threw rice. The bride and groom looked so young I felt like I must\u0027ve missed an entire generation of people getting married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shavingcreamdecorated limo pulled up, and Matthew\u0027s driver looked across the street with distaste. Probably done his share of wedding gigs. Probably was a whole lot easier driving around one bitter paraplegic in a wheelchair. He called, \"Mr. Pena?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlane time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena stared at me. \"Don\u0027t screw up with Maia twice, Navarre. You understand me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery other insult I can live with, even being in this chair, but I could not live with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water kept galooshing into the pool. The wedding couple got into their limo and drove off in a blizzard of rice and displaced pigeons. Matthew Pena turned and wheeled himself toward the Lexus. The driver helped him from the chair to the backseat, folded the chair, put it in the trunk. The last I saw of Matthew, he was staring at me with those cold dead eyes, giving me a warning. Then the black glass shut on him like a microwave door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia pressed her fingertips together. Sprinkles of water from the fountain were freckling her blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me, managed a smile. \"Just hoping he gets better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The scary thing is, he probably will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we heard the rumble of motorcycles, looked toward Guadalupe and saw six Harley hogs coming up 24th, disrupting the wedding guests and pigeons alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmand was riding left flank, his shoulder heavily padded but apparently not affecting his biking ability. Four other black leather warriors fanned out to his right, all of them overweight and slightly grizzled. The Metamucil Diablos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde Simms rode lead, his bike fixed with a brandnew flame emblazoned sidecar in which my brother Garrett rode like some World War II general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had dark shades on, his rainbow shirt, his leather helmet straps flapping loosely around his beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" he yelled. \"Knew if we circled the campus enough times we\u0027d catch you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me that crooked piranha grin I hadn\u0027t seen in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bikes pulled over. I shook hands with Clyde, Armand, got introductions with the others. Maia gave Garrett a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off to see the lizard?\" Maia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man,\" Garrett said, \"I have never appreciated freedom so much. We are off and we ain\u0027t stopping for anything but concerts and liquor till we hit Key West. You sure you don\u0027t want to ditch your real lives and come along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia and I smiled, shook our heads, though I thought—maybe— Maia was a little tempted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of real life ...\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, man. The check cleared. A little negotiating with Pena, he was able to see his way clear to a cash payment in exchange for dropping a lawsuit. He\u0027s already in enough trouble with the SEC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett\u0027s work with the High Tech Unit had indeed managed to trace the leaked security files to Pena\u0027s computer. In fact, the High Tech guys had been sufficiently impressed with Garrett\u0027s work to offer him some contract gigs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to be working law enforcement?\" I asked. \"What would Dad say about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett shrugged. \"I got time to think about that now. Oh, and by the way, I got something for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dug a manila folder out of his seat, tossed it to me. \"Maybe I caught the Christmas spirit. Ruby\u0027s will—she left the whole damn marina to Clyde, did you know that? We damn near had to peel him off the ceiling when he heard. I figured Ruby was good enough to do that, I\u0027d better make her proud of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the documents inside the folder, saw Lars Elder\u0027s name, First Bank of Sabinal. I saw yellow highlighted places, red Xs where I was supposed to sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Garrett. He was grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garrett,\" I said. \"This isn\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just sign that puppy, Tres. Make it official. I\u0027m giving the ranch to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t what Dad wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett laughed. \"Come here, ugly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his hand and he pulled me into a sloppy hug, then pushed me back with equal force. \"It\u0027s what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Maia. She was smiling like she\u0027d known this was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett told her, \"Try to keep him from getting shot while I\u0027m gone, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia said, \"No promises. Take care of yourself, Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde Simms said, \"Concert in Houston ain\u0027t going to wait, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett put down his shades, gave the thumbsup, and the caravan moved out in a roar of exhaust and black leather and tiedye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia looked at me, looked at the deed, and had to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she kissed me, and everything went digital—sound, colour, all of it superreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away, said, \"What if I told you I was staying in Austin for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to concentrate on the man selling eggrolls across the street. His vending cart, at least, I could think about without raising my blood pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you telling me that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I need to get some things out of my system. I was thinking a few months of extreme heat might do the trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really. What things out of your system?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked straight at me. \"Mostly you, Tres. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve quite gotten you out of my system, you bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding guests had all drifted away. Students walked around us, the water fountain churned, the eggrolls\u0027 smell wafted across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia\u0027s smile made me remember a night in Berkeley a dozen years ago, when she\u0027d left her business card on the bar next to the last round of margaritas I\u0027d ever mixed for money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some calls to make,\" she said, \"some apartments to look at. See you tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I watched her walk away down 24th, I thought what I\u0027d thought so many years ago in Berkeley—that this was a woman who would either change my life or get me killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, tonight,\" I murmured hopefully. Then I went to talk to the vendor across the street. His eggrolls smelled awfully good. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-51.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM"}
