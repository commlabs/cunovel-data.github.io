{"id":12396,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his paper. But this morning, like everybody else in the train, he approached the headlines with an unusual thrill of interest, for an immense sensation was in process of being unrolled in the press.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two days before, Silas Gyde, the millionaire miser and usurer, had been blown to pieces in the street by a bomb. The assassin, arrested, proved to be not one of those who had a grievance against the old money lender (there were supposed to be many such) but a maniac of anarchistic proclivities. His name was Emil Jansen. He was already on the way to an asylum for the criminal insane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The main facts of the case having been given in previous issues, space in the paper to-day was largely devoted to anecdotes illustrating the extraordinary eccentricities of the dead man. It was said that with an income of perhaps six millions a year, he spent no more than six hundred. He bought his clothes at an immigrant outfitters\u0027 on Washington street, and even so had not had a new suit in two years. To keep himself from spending money it was his habit to go about with empty pockets, and borrow what few cents he needed from bootblacks, newsboys and applewomen to whom he was well known. But he was scrupulous in repaying these debts. Every day, even when he had become old and feeble, he turned up at the office of a certain corporation for the sake of a free lunch provided to the directors, though he had to walk a mile from the Wall street district where all his business was transacted. It was at the door of this office that he had met his end. And so on. And so on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Silas Gyde died a bachelor, and had left no kin so far as was known. His wealth was said to be well in excess of a hundred million dollars. The paper gave a tempting list of the gilt-edge securities he was supposed to own; but nothing was known for sure, for though continually engaged in litigation, he had left no personal attorney; he had not sufficiently trusted any man. No one could say, now, where he had kept his wealth or how he had intended to dispose of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Young Jack Norman read of the millions with the kind of aching gusto that a hungry man pictures a good dinner. Jack\u0027s earnings were twelve dollars a week. He knew little about sociology or economics, but he could not but feel a dim dissatisfaction with the scheme of things that restricted him, with all a youth\u0027s capacity for living largely, to twelve dollars weekly, while it provided the old man with the tastes of a hermit crab, with a hundred thousand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Twelve dollars a week meant that Jack\u0027s still boyish appetite daily had to be less than satisfied by the fare of a second rate boarding house; it meant that he had to wear cheap clothes when the instinct of his years was to array himself like Solomon; it meant that his lip must curl with envy as the pleasures of the town passed him by; hardest of all to bear, it meant that the joys of honorable courtship were denied him. A fellow must have money to take a girl out in town.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s case was not peculiar. The same expression of sullen wistfulness might have been read in many a young face on the same train. What distinguished this face from the others was a latent fire in the eyes which suggested that, given the opportunity, the possessor had the capacity to play a larger part in life than twelve dollars a week permitted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He got off at Worth street and made his way East to Centre where he worked as book-keeper in Fisher\u0027s sash and blind factory. Walking the street, like many another young head that morning, his was light with dreams.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I had Silas Gyde\u0027s money I wouldn\u0027t be pounding the concrete like this. I\u0027d be fluffing down to Wall street in my Rolls-Royce. Or my yacht would be putting me ashore at the Battery. Or a special train up from Lakewood. First thing I\u0027d do would be to tell Fisher to go to Hell. Oh, that would be worth a million!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d say to Fisher: \u0027Who do you think you are, you little two-spot bankrupt carpenter with your business in your wife\u0027s name! One would think you were William K. Astorbilt, the airs you give yourself. Why I could buy you out for the price of what I spend for a meal!\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he turned in at the door of Fisher\u0027s place Jack\u0027s eyes involuntarily sought a window in the establishment of the hardware jobber opposite. As present the window was tenantless; later it would be sanctified by a chestnut head bending over a typewriter. Jack\u0027s dreams were diverted into another channel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I had Silas Gyde\u0027s money she wouldn\u0027t have to pay for her own lunch when she eats with me. And I could take her out nights. Oh! Automobile, dress-suit, box seats at the Opera, supper at the Bienvenu and a dance! Lord! And they say old Gyde lived on my salary!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The offices of the Fisher factory were on the second floor. As Jack turned in from the hall, Fisher himself was standing at the door of his private office; hands in pockets, cigar rolling between thick lips, hat on the back of his head, on his face the customary brutal sneer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re late!\" he rasped. \"Can\u0027t you get out of bed in the mornings?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was a regular performance at Fisher\u0027s. The boss took his pleasure that way, and the office employees were hardened to it. But at the moment Jack was exalted. In his imagination he was still the master of millions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The clock\u0027s fast,\" he said curtly, meeting Fisher square in the eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You lie!\" said that gentleman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By way of answer Jack pulled out his watch and compared it with the wall clock. The glance was not complimentary to Fisher\u0027s battered time-piece. Fisher purpled with rage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You —— ——! Don\u0027t give me any of your lip!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who do you think you are?\" said Jack coolly. The words were fatally ready to his tongue. \"You little two-by-four sash and blind maker with your business in your wife\u0027s name! Better pay your bills before you talk that way to honest men!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Behind the fright in the eyes of the thin office-boy and the pale typist, gleamed a wondering delight. Never had such words been heard in that place!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get out of here! Get out of here!\" roared Fisher on the verge of apoplexy. \"Get out before I throw you out!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As to that,\" said Jack, \"you\u0027re not man enough,\" and he took a step nearer the boss.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fisher precipitately retired into his private office, slamming the door behind him. The office boy tittered, and clapped a scared hand over his mouth. Jack turned on his heel, and coolly lit a cigarette—lit it and blew a whole cloud of smoke, there in those sacred precincts! The eyes of the other two regarded him with a kind of adoration.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From behind the partition Fisher was still shouting: \"Get out! You\u0027re fired!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Much obliged,\" said Jack. \"It was worth it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But even while he spake the brave words his heart was sinking like a stone in deep water. It was Wednesday, and his salary was always spent in advance of course. All he possessed in the world was a dollar twenty and his watch—fortunately out of hock for the time being. By this time, he thought Fisher was probably sorry too, and would take him back at a word of contrition—but with those admiring eyes on him, he could not speak it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So long, Kids,\" he said airily, and started for the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, wait a minute,\" said the boy. \"Here\u0027s a letter for you this morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack thrust it carelessly into his pocket and went on down-stairs. At the street door he stopped at a loss. Turned loose on the street at nine o\u0027clock of a working morning, which way was one to turn? He glanced across the street again, the window was still vacant. Anyway, he couldn\u0027t very well see her, jobless as he was. Better just drop of sight. This thought cost him a shrewd pang. He started walking quickly in the direction opposite to that whence she would presently come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He remembered the letter and took it out. Letters were not so frequent in his life that he could afford to disdain them. This was a business envelope, large, square, and made of thick, fine paper. \"National New York Bank\" was neatly embossed on the flap. It was addressed in long-hand, an untidy but powerful scrawl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some high-class ad,\" thought Jack. \"Want to sell me bonds, I suppose.\" He chuckled with bitter humor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Inside he found this communication in the same hand:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear Mr. Norman:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you please call me up at my office to-morrow morning. I shall arrive there about nine-thirty. The number of my private phone is —— Broad. You will not find it in the book.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very truly yours,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Walter Delamare.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack, being a true American youth, regarded this skeptically. \"What kind of a con is he handing me?\" he thought. \"Who the deuce is Walter Delamare?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The name rang familiarly in his ears. He glanced at the note head again. Under the name of the bank was printed: \"Office of the President.\" Of course! Walter Delamare, President of the National New York Bank. His name was in the papers every day. It wielded a magic influence in the nation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack still suspected a hoax of some kind, though the expensive note paper and the scrawly, characteristic hand were impressive. He examined the latter with fresh care. It was surely real handwriting, not process work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh well, it\u0027s worth a nickel for a telephone call,\" he thought. \"I have nothing to lose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had nearly half an hour to kill before nine-thirty, and no twenty-five minutes ever passed more slowly. He walked down to Wall street and had a look at the outside of the National New York Bank, an imposing colonnade a whole block long. He circumnavigated it three times, and at nine thirty-one, precisely, went into a cigar store and called up the number that had been given him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a due interval he heard a voice at the other end of the wire that certainly sounded like that of a man of mark—crisp, serene, potent; humorous and kindly, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Norman?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is Delamare. You are prompt. Can you come down to see me this morning?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you come right away? Later I shall be very busy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good! Better taxi down. And by the way, it would be better if you sent in an assumed name. I will explain why when I see you. Call yourself—let me see—call yourself Mr. Robinson.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well. I shall be expecting you. Good-by.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack issued from the telephone booth a little dazed. A great captain of finance asking him, the humble bookkeeper, to call! Putting Jack on an equal footing by referring to himself as \"Delamare\"! A mystery suggested by the use of an assumed name! What could it all mean! On the one hand the skeptic in Jack whispered: \"Some one is putting up a game on you!\" On the other hand the dear hidden ego in us all that only needs a little appreciation to show its head said: \"Why shouldn\u0027t Walter Delamare have private business with you as well as anybody?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack had only to walk across the street to the bank. The argument within him showed itself in a kind of defiant sheepishness as he passed the great portal and found himself under the far-flung vaulted ceiling. It had been designed to impress, and impressive it was. With its rare marbles and mural paintings it was more like a palace than a place of sober business. It was not yet the opening hour, but many elegant clerks were already starting to work behind the brass grills. Shabby Jack eyed their cravats and fine linen wistfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He asked one of the uniformed attendants the way to Mr. Delamare\u0027s office, half expecting a roar of laughter to go up. But nothing of the sort occurred. He next found himself opposed by a silvery-haired old gentleman whose exquisite courtesy was the same to all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Whom do you wish to see?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Delamare.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Delamare can be seen only by appointment.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have an appointment.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The courteous old gentleman permitted himself a glance of surprise. \"What name shall I say?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Robinson.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very good, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He returned with an air of slightly heightened respect. \"Please step this way, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is all right,\" thought Jack. \"Nobody is hoaxing me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He followed his conductor down a mahogany and plate glass corridor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61336.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:40:24 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:40:24 AM"}
