It was found next to her body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I was with Race. We came into the house, and his mother—she was lying on the . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tear made its way down her cheek. She brushed it away like it was coming from somewhere else—like an insect or rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time\u0027s up,” Olsen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going back to San Francisco,” Chadwick told Mallory. “Tell me where to find Race.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you can turn him in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I can talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory moistened her lips, and Chadwick got the uncomfortable feeling she was deciding whether or not to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Chadwick,” Olsen said, her fingers covering the watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His grandmother\u0027s,” Mallory said. “She lives in downtown Oakland, off 14th.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The police have already checked there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. But that\u0027s where he\u0027d go. That\u0027s the only place he could go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory\u0027s eyes were intense green, just like her father\u0027s. “Make sure he\u0027s okay, Chadwick. He didn\u0027t do anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick promised nothing, but he got the uncomfortable feeling he\u0027d made an irretrievable bargain—one that cuffed him to the table more firmly than Mallory\u0027s plastic wrist restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the hillside, where the deer had gone back to grazing. He wondered if the grass tasted any different on Thanksgiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll do what I can,” Chadwick told her. “If you concentrate on the program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate the program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start small.” He remembered the little girl who used to steal white meat as soon as it was carved, then go running, giggling wildly, through the house as her father pretended to chase her. “You like turkey. Eat some.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory looked at the plate of food, now cold. She picked up a half-moon of turkey, bit off a piece. She started to put the rest down, then changed her mind and took another bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen said, “I\u0027ll cut your restraint. When you\u0027re done, we\u0027ll take you back to the Black Level barracks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mallory ate, Chadwick motioned to Olsen. She followed him as far as the sliding glass doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s hiding something,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen crossed her arms, the shoulder bandage crinkling under her jacket. The skin around her eyes tightened. “The girl\u0027s whole life, people have betrayed her—Katherine, you, her parents. Now she\u0027s wondering if Race has lied to her, too. Of course she\u0027s hiding something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t approve of me talking to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your priorities are wrong. You\u0027re more interested in torturing yourself about your daughter than helping Mallory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt anger building in his stomach, but mostly because he was afraid she was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re making progress with her,” he said. “I\u0027m impressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know why? I told her I\u0027m not leaving, no matter what. She can\u0027t push me away. I learned that from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked nothing like the young woman who had been so afraid at the Rockridge café. There was determination in her eyes, absolute conviction that she was going to help this kid. Chadwick remembered why he had chosen her as a partner in the first place—she had a good heart. Heart wasn\u0027t something you could fake. It wasn\u0027t something you could train for. And it wasn\u0027t something she had learned from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch out for her,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She stabbed me. Of course I\u0027ll watch out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I mean, keep her safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re worried about somebody coming after her? Is that what you\u0027re talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s just a feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at Mallory, but seemed to be looking through her—straight into the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll stick by her,” she promised. “That\u0027s my job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick knew she didn\u0027t mean it as an accusation, but he remembered her words the day she\u0027d quit—that his job was a form of perpetually running away. He felt the same wistful resentment he\u0027d felt on the plane, when the flight attendant had assumed they were father and daughter. “You identify with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remind you of someone, too, don\u0027t I? Not a good memory. That\u0027s really why you couldn\u0027t work with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ask who it was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could,” she said, “except for two things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you your priorities are screwed up. I can\u0027t very well admit that maybe mine are, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s the other reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrow, as if that should be obvious. She tapped her wristwatch. “Your time is up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked back to the picnic table, where Mallory Zedman was eating a cold Thanksgiving dinner in the fading afternoon light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, Chadwick and Kindra Jones took a flight to Boston. They picked up a thirteen-year-old who\u0027d been expelled from his middle school for dealing Ecstasy and flew him to the Green Mesa facility in North Carolina. An easy job. The kid knew it was either Dr. Hunter or Juvenile Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones had dressed in another corduroy and flannel montage, her freshly braided cornrows glistening with styler. She spent the plane trip arguing with the kid about whether Lauryn Hill or Dr. Dre was the bigger musical genius. Chadwick, who had no opinion, read two chapters of a Theodore Roosevelt biography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called John Zedman from Raleigh-Durham International and got voice mail. He left a message, telling John he was coming to town and wanted to meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Laurel Heights and got the secretary, who told him Ann was in a meeting with Ms. Reyes—no interruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday morning, he and Jones transferred a gray level who\u0027d been diagnosed anorexic to Bowl Ranch in Utah. Again, Jones fell into easy conversation with the kid, this time about the death of reality television. Between flights at DFW, Chadwick called both the Zedmans and failed to get them. On the last call to John\u0027s house, a man with a slight Spanish accent answered the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick gave his name, and the man was silent so long Chadwick thought he\u0027d hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the man said, “This is Emilio Pérez. Let me give you some advice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027d rather you put your boss on the phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You come out here, you\u0027d best be returning the girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s not open for discussion, Mr. Pérez.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Z? He remembers how you used to be a friend—only reason he hasn\u0027t let me hang you on a meat hook yet. Me? I got no sentimental problems. I know what you are. I know your game. You show your face, I\u0027m going to make Talia Montrose\u0027s murder look like a quiet death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKindra Jones came back from the TCBY, handed him a cup of yogurt with rainbow sprinkles and a pink plastic spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got chocolate for me and the kid,” she said. “Figured you for a vanilla man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday evening at Bowl Ranch, Chadwick stared out the lodge window at miles of red sandstone—rock formations and stunted junipers marbled with snow like a Martian Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about Mallory Zedman on the porch at Cold Springs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Olsen\u0027s voice in his mind—Olsen, whom he\u0027d accused of running away from her fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the moment he turned the first shovelful of dirt onto Katherine\u0027s coffin lid, Chadwick had known he would be moving to Texas. He would devote his life to pulling troubled kids out of crises, rewriting his failure with his daughter, over and over again. He told himself the job had been hard penance. In the years since, he had seen his share of suicides. He had been shot at, spit at, cursed and sued by the very parents who hired him. He had changed lives, delivered a lot of kids into Hunter\u0027s care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut emotionally, escorting was safe—a brief, scripted performance where success was easy to measure, not much different than his history classes at Laurel Heights, or the way his own father had dealt with children—as appointments, gears to be oiled, chains to be balanced, with care and skill, but no particular emotional attachment. Chadwick could help kids on that level. He could do it brilliantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when it came to permanent commitment—living with a child, letting her see you warts and all, unscripted and stumbling and unsure, staying with her no matter what, whether she screamed or stabbed or turned away—Chadwick had never been good at that, even with Katherine. Especially with Katherine. He had failed his daughter. And nothing he had done in the nine years since—not all the escorts he had made, all the children he had pulled from horrible situations—atoned for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, when they got to the San Francisco rental car counter, Chadwick asked Jones if she was up for a little sightseeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him an easy grin. “Noticed you got us in here on the earliest possible flight, and the pickup isn\u0027t until tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few courtesy calls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh. You want to tell me what about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Preferably not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted the car keys from his hand. “In that case, I\u0027m driving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, Chadwick was impressed by Jones\u0027 command of the terrible Bay Area traffic. After a few blocks, he realized Jones was the reason for the terrible traffic. Curbs were loose guidelines for her. So were sidewalks, pedestrians, traffic lights, medians, other people\u0027s bumpers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter twenty minutes of death sport on Highway 101, then weaving through downtown playing kill-tag with the bike couriers, Jones found an open stretch of Van Ness and shot north. She fishtailed onto California, sent coffee-toting students and medical workers diving for cover, and slammed the car into fourth gear for the final half mile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is it,” Chadwick warned. “This is it. That was it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones swerved onto Walnut, pulling over a red curb and crunching into a trash can two doors down from Laurel Heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick exhaled for the first time in a mile and a half. “You hardly killed anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just jealous,” she said. Then she pointed with her chin. “What\u0027s going on over there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a block up, across the street, a local CBS satellite news van was cranked for business. The reporter\u0027s back was to them, the cameraman filming in their direction. The backdrop for their news spot was Laurel Heights School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold feeling started to build in Chadwick\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe auction would be tomorrow—the first Friday after Thanksgiving. Maybe Ann had arranged some publicity. But the thermometer banner that had hung in front of the school was gone. It didn\u0027t seem right they would take that down before the final fund-raiser, especially with the press coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones slid down her black horn-rims, checked out Laurel Heights, tall and cozy on its hill. “That\u0027s your old school, huh? Think they could afford a paint job in a neighborhood this snooty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to come in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And do what—talk to the custodians?” Kindra leaned back in the driver\u0027s seat, propped open an April Sinclair novel on the wheel. “No thanks, Chad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could respond to the unwelcome nickname, he saw Norma hurrying down the steps of the school. From the stiffness of her shoulders, the way she held her rolled-up newspaper, Chadwick knew she\u0027d been arguing with someone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-24.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM"}
