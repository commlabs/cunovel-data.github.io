As the days after the patrol\u0027s return stretched out into an uneventful week, and then a second, thoughts of the slain goblin took second place to the very real threat of winter\u0027s onset. There was much to be done: the last harvesting, preparing the meat, patching holes in the cottages, and cleaning the chimneys. Every passing day, danger from the goblins seemed more and more remote; every passing day, fewer and fewer men and women went out of the town to walk a patrol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan and his friends, some as young as six or seven, saw their chance unfolding. For the adults, the specter of the goblins brought a sobering wariness and then a troublesome distraction. For the younger villagers, whose imaginations were far livelier and whose sense of adventure hadn\u0027t yet been tempered by any real loss, thoughts of goblin raids brought excitement, a call to arms, a time for heroes. Elbryan and his friends had offered to walk patrols since the first day of the hunting party\u0027s return. Each morning, they approached the village leaders, and each morning, they were politely refused and quickly put to some more mundane task. Even Elbryan, who would be entering the realm of adults that coming spring, had spent almost all the previous week with his head up a dirty chimney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the young man held faith and passed his hopes down the line. The adults were tiring of their patrols, he knew, and were growing more and more confident that the goblin incident was a chance thing -- a single, unfortunate meeting -- and that those creatures which had been chased away would not return to the site of the battle, let alone try to track the humans back to their village, some thirty miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with two calm weeks behind them and no further sightings except for a few wild rumors that were discounted by even the most cautious of Dundalis\u0027 folk, Elbryan recognized the lessening of resistance in his father\u0027s voice. He was not surprised that morning when Olwan, instead of shaking his head, bent low and sketched out in the dirt a rough map of the area, explaining to his son where he and his friends should be positioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan was surprised, though, and pleasantly so, when Olwan then presented him with the family sword, a short, thick blade of two-foot length. It wasn\u0027t an impressive weapon -- its blade showed many nicks and more than a little rust -- but it was one of the few real swords in the village. \"Make certain that every one of your group is well armed,\" Olwan said seriously. \"And make sure that each knows the value, and the danger, of his or her weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlwan knew what this meant to his son, and if he had smiled or let on in any way that the patrols were no longer really necessary, he would have stolen something from Elbryan, a measure of importance that the young man desperately needed to feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it is wise to let the children go out with weapons?\" Shane McMichael asked Olwan, coming up to the large man soon after Elbryan had run off. \"Or to let them go out at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlwan snorted and shrugged his muscular shoulders. \"We cannot spare the men and women,\" he replied, \"and there is the other patrol in the vale, the most likely route for our enemies to take, should they come.\" Olwan gave another snort, a helpless sound that surprised McMichael, who had always known Olwan as the coolest and most confident head in all the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" Olwan went on, \"if the goblins or fomorians get close enough to Dundalis for my son and his friends to see, they will be as well off out in the woods as in the village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShane McMichael did not argue the point, though the weight of it grew steadily on his shoulders. Since Honce-the-Bear had been at peace for many years -- and goblins and evil giants receding from the thoughts of most people to become little more than fireside tales -- Dundalis had not been built for defense. The village was not even walled, as earlier settlements near the Wilderlands had been, and the folk were not well armed. The hunting party of twelve had carried with them more than half the total real weapons of the hundred folk of Dundalis. Olwan was right, Shane McMichael knew, and he shuddered with the thought; if the goblins got close enough for Elbryan and the others to spot them, then all the village would be in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlwan started away, and McMichael calmed and moved to follow. He really didn\u0027t think any goblins would come; none in the village except for pessimistic old Brody Gentle spoke of such darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patrols began that day, with a score and five youngsters walking the rim of the bowl-shaped vale that held Dundalis. There was one other patrol, a handful of older teenagers, venturing further out, down among the pines and fluffy caribou moss to the northeast. Each of this group nodded respectfully at his younger counterparts as he passed them on the rim; some mentioned that Elbryan\u0027s patrols would serve as their vital liaison with the village proper. After that exchange of compliments, even the passing of endless uneventful hours could not dampen the thrill for the youngsters. Elbryan and his friends were not being left out this time, were not being treated as mere children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs each day slipped past -- the weather growing a bit colder, the wind shifting more to the north -- the twenty-five in Elbryan\u0027s group perfected their patrol routes. Elbryan split them into four teams of five and one of three, which would move from group to group gathering information, while he and Pony served as anchor to them all, holding a position along the highest ridge directly north of Dundalis, overlooking the valley of evergreens and caribou moss. There were several complaints about this arrangement at first, mostly from the older boys who thought that they should serve as Elbryan\u0027s second. Some even resorted to teasing Elbryan about his growing relationship with Pony, prompting him to \"ride the Pony,\" and other such crudities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan took it all in stride, with the exception of any insults to Pony, which he promptly informed the teasers would bring them serious and painful retaliation. He didn\u0027t care about their teasing him though, having at last admitted, to himself and openly, that Pony was his best and most-trusted friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the children have their fun,\" Elbryan, coming into manhood, whispered to Pony as the groups split up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he wasn\u0027t looking her way, when he had moved off to set up a windbreak of dead wood, Pony regarded him knowingly, a warm smile spreading over her face. * * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething else watched the young man from a perch in one of the thicker pines on the ridge. It moved nimbly from branch to branch, crossing over to nearby trees with barely a whisper. It shadowed Elbryan\u0027s every move, studying the young leader intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Pony and Elbryan, alert as they were, the creature was invisible and unnoticed. Even if they had looked intently the creature\u0027s way, its movements were so fluid and graceful -- and always under the cover of pine boughs -- that they would have considered the sway of the branches no more than the movement of the wind or a gray squirrel, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother week passed by uneventfully. Work in the village was at full pace, readying for winter. On the ridge and in the vale beyond, the primary enemy became boredom. Elbryan lost half a dozen of his patrol at the beginning of that second week, the youths explaining that their parents needed them about the house and would not let them go out. Elbryan did not miss that every one of those \"soldiers\" seemed grateful to be relieved of the dull patrols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan continued his diligent work, though, reorganizing the routes to cover more ground since he was down to three teams of five, with a couple of messengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll lose Shamus tomorrow,\" Pony said as they sat side by side in a hollow on the high ridge, sheltered from the chill wind by a pair of large pines. The day was late, and gray clouds were rolling in to hide the afternoon sun. \"His mother told me this morning this would be his last day out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan prodded the ground with the tip of his sword. \"His patrol group goes to four, then,\" he said matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony recognized the frustration in his voice, though he did well to hide it. Elbryan was watching his first command crumbling about him, his soldiers being taken away so that they could help patch roofs or shore up barns. Pony sympathized with the young man, but logically, this was the best scenario they could have hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are being called back home because no enemy has come,\" she gently reminded him. \"Better this than for your patrol to have been truly necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan looked at her, little luster showing in his normally bright green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe we were necessary,\" Pony quickly added, trying to salvage some measure of the young man\u0027s pride. \"How do we know that goblins have not ventured near Dundalis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan cocked his head and ran a hand through his thick layers of straight, light brown hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps their scouts did come near us,\" Pony went on. \"Perhaps they saw our patrols and realized they would not have an easy time of it against the village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are just children,\" Elbryan said disgustedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony shook her head. \"And all but the smallest of our group is larger than a goblin,\" she replied without hesitation, and that truth seemed to lend some credence to her reasoning. \"Is not the best army the one so strong that enemies will not dare attack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan didn\u0027t answer, but that familiar sparkle fit up his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to regard the ground in front of him, and the wild design he was cutting with the sword tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony smiled warmly, feeling that she had done well. It pleased her greatly to help out Elbryan, to guard his emotions. She didn\u0027t really believe goblins had come near enough to see the patrols, and neither did Elbryan, but at least this way he could hold out some reason to believe his first real effort at something important by adult standards had not been in vain. The simple fact that they could not be absolutely certain offered Elbryan all the encouragement he needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony dared to reach out then; the connection was too strong to let the moment pass. She cupped Elbryan\u0027s chin in one hand and gently turned him back to face her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have done a wonderful job out here,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not alone,\" he started to reply, but she stopped him by putting a finger of her free hand across his lips. Only then did Elbryan realize how close they were, their faces barely two inches apart. He felt warm suddenly, a bit dizzy, a bit frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony drifted closer. She kissed him! Full on the lips! Elbryan was terrified and thrilled all at once. He thought he should pull away, spit on the ground, and yell \"girl poison!\" as was the expected response, as had been his response all the other times Pony, or any of the other girls, had tried to kiss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to do that; the last notion in his mind was to pull away. He realized then that it had been a long, long time since Pony had tried to kiss him -- at least a year. Had she feared his reaction? Had she known he would have spit and yelled out \"girl poison,\" a chant that would have been taken up by every boy in the village?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had she known he wasn\u0027t ready, until now, to be kissed? That was it, the young man decided as the gentle kiss, their closed mouths barely touching, lingered on and on. Pony knew him so very well, better than he knew himself. Their last few days together, alone for four of every five hours, had brought them even closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now this. Elbryan didn\u0027t want it to end. He shifted in his seat, first lifted the short sword, then, realizing that it would be awkward, perhaps even dangerous, dropped it to the ground. He dared to put his arms around Pony\u0027s back, dared to pull her closer, feeling the strangely interesting curves and bumps of her body against his own as they came together. He fought a fit of panic -- not knowing what he should do, where he should move his hands, or if he should move his hands at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Elbryan knew was that he didn\u0027t want the kiss to end, that he wanted something more, though he wasn\u0027t really sure what that might be. He wanted to be closer to Pony, physically and emotionally. This was his Pony, his dearest friend, the girl -- no, the young woman -- whom he had grown to love. He would pass into manhood that spring, Pony into womanhood the following autumn, and soon after, he would ask for Pony\u0027s hand . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat notion brought fear and Elbryan tried to pull away -- and did break the hold long enough to catch his breath. Again, the fears passed, lost in a swirl of warmth as he looked at Pony\u0027s shining blue eyes, at her smile, as genuine and joyful as anything Elbryan had ever seen. She hardly had to nudge him to get him to kiss her again, and they settled even more comfortably together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss shifted, from curiosity to urgency, then back to gentleness. Their clothes ruffled and seemed more of an obstacle than a necessity. Though the air was chill, Elbryan had the feeling he would be warmer without them. His hands did move now, as he lost his fear of touching Pony. He caressed her neck, ran his hand down her side and along the outside of her strong leg. He was shocked as her mouth opened a little bit, as he felt her tongue against his lips, so soft and inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment, this most precious moment in all of Elbryan\u0027s young life . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then suddenly, it was gone, destroyed by a horrified, and horrifying, scream. The couple jumped apart and to their feet, staring wide-eyed down the long slope to the village, at the swarming forms, at the large plume of smoke -- too large to come from any chimney! -- rising from one of the houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblins had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of miles away, in a windswept, foreboding -- land called the Barbacan, in a deep cave in a mountain called Aida, the dactyl basked in the sensation of rear. The demon creature could feel the screams of those dying in Dundalis, though it had no idea where the battle was being waged. This was an action of a rogue goblin chieftain, perhaps, or one of the many powrie raiding parties, acting on their own initiative, bringing misery to the wretched humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dactyl could not take direct credit, but that mattered little. It had awakened, darkness rising, and already its influence was spreading throughout Corona. Already the goblins, the powries, or one of the other races the demon would claim as minions had felt that awakening and had been given the courage to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature flexed its great wings and settled back in the throne it had shaped from the obsidian that had formerly served as its tomb. Yes, the dark vibrations were running strong through the stone. The sensation of war, of human agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good to be awake. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-awakens-the-demonwars-saga-1/page-4.html","bookId":2167,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:32:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:32:39 PM"}
