Don\u0027t you KNOW that you mustn\u0027t give one girl\n\u003cbr\u003e seventeen Christmas presents? I\u0027m a Socialist, please remember;\n\u003cbr\u003e do you wish to turn me into a Plutocrat?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Think how embarrassing it would be if we should ever quarrel! \n\u003cbr\u003e I should have to engage a moving-van to return your gifts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am sorry that the necktie I sent was so wobbly; I knit it with my\n\u003cbr\u003e own hands (as you doubtless discovered from internal evidence).\n\u003cbr\u003e You will have to wear it on cold days and keep your coat buttoned\n\u003cbr\u003e up tight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. I think you\u0027re the sweetest\n\u003cbr\u003e man that ever lived--and the foolishest!\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here\u0027s a four-leaf clover from Camp McBride to bring you good luck\n\u003cbr\u003e for the New Year.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 9th January\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you wish to do something, Daddy, that will ensure your\n\u003cbr\u003e eternal salvation? There is a family here who are in awfully\n\u003cbr\u003e desperate straits. A mother and father and four visible children--\n\u003cbr\u003e the two older boys have disappeared into the world to make their\n\u003cbr\u003e fortune and have not sent any of it back. The father worked in a\n\u003cbr\u003e glass factory and got consumption--it\u0027s awfully unhealthy work--\n\u003cbr\u003e and now has been sent away to a hospital. That took all their savings,\n\u003cbr\u003e and the support of the family falls upon the oldest daughter,\n\u003cbr\u003e who is twenty-four. She dressmakes for $1.50 a day (when she can\n\u003cbr\u003e get it) and embroiders centrepieces in the evening. The mother\n\u003cbr\u003e isn\u0027t very strong and is extremely ineffectual and pious. \n\u003cbr\u003e She sits with her hands folded, a picture of patient resignation,\n\u003cbr\u003e while the daughter kills herself with overwork and responsibility\n\u003cbr\u003e and worry; she doesn\u0027t see how they are going to get through the\n\u003cbr\u003e rest of the winter--and I don\u0027t either. One hundred dollars would\n\u003cbr\u003e buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that they could\n\u003cbr\u003e go to school, and give a little margin so that she needn\u0027t worry\n\u003cbr\u003e herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn\u0027t get work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You are the richest man I know. Don\u0027t you suppose you could spare\n\u003cbr\u003e one hundred dollars? That girl deserves help a lot more than I\n\u003cbr\u003e ever did. I wouldn\u0027t ask it except for the girl; I don\u0027t care\n\u003cbr\u003e much what happens to the mother--she is such a jelly-fish.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The way people are for ever rolling their eyes to heaven and saying,\n\u003cbr\u003e `Perhaps it\u0027s all for the best,\u0027 when they are perfectly dead sure\n\u003cbr\u003e it\u0027s not, makes me enraged. Humility or resignation or whatever\n\u003cbr\u003e you choose to call it, is simply impotent inertia. I\u0027m for a more\n\u003cbr\u003e militant religion!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophy--all of\n\u003cbr\u003e Schopenhauer for tomorrow. The professor doesn\u0027t seem to realize\n\u003cbr\u003e that we are taking any other subject. He\u0027s a queer old duck;\n\u003cbr\u003e he goes about with his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly\n\u003cbr\u003e when occasionally he strikes solid earth. He tries to lighten\n\u003cbr\u003e his lectures with an occasional witticism--and we do our best\n\u003cbr\u003e to smile, but I assure you his jokes are no laughing matter. \n\u003cbr\u003e He spends his entire time between classes in trying to figure\n\u003cbr\u003e out whether matter really exists or whether he only thinks it exists.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sure my sewing girl hasn\u0027t any doubt but that it exists!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where do you think my new novel is? In the waste-basket. I can\n\u003cbr\u003e see myself that it\u0027s no good on earth, and when a loving author\n\u003cbr\u003e realizes that, what WOULD be the judgment of a critical public?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Later\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I address you, Daddy, from a bed of pain. For two days I\u0027ve\n\u003cbr\u003e been laid up with swollen tonsils; I can just swallow hot milk,\n\u003cbr\u003e and that is all. `What were your parents thinking of not to have\n\u003cbr\u003e those tonsils out when you were a baby?\u0027 the doctor wished to know. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sure I haven\u0027t an idea, but I doubt if they were thinking much\n\u003cbr\u003e about me.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours,\n\u003cbr\u003e J. A.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Next morning\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I just read this over before sealing it. I don\u0027t know WHY I cast\n\u003cbr\u003e such a misty atmosphere over life. I hasten to assure you that I\n\u003cbr\u003e am young and happy and exuberant; and I trust you are the same. \n\u003cbr\u003e Youth has nothing to do with birthdays, only with ALIVEDNESS of spirit,\n\u003cbr\u003e so even if your hair is grey, Daddy, you can still be a boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59783.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
