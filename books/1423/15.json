{"id":9072,"no":15,"title":"Chapter XV THE SHOOTING FLAME","content":"“And that’s that,” said Bill, still keeping his voice to a whisper. “Disgusting old beast! Let’s turn off the lights in here and try the window. Anything is better than lying here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait a minute—I’ve an idea!” Sanborn pointed to the fireplace. Bill nodded and together they wriggled across the rugs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The chimney, with its grate of glowing coals, was an old-fashioned structure. Although probably no older than this modern residence, it appeared to be a worthy monument of another generation. Wide at the base, it tapered toward the top, and on its inner walls a number of iron staples, rusty and covered with soot, led upward.\n\u003cbr\u003e 201\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sanborn stepped within the chimney and grasped the first staple. “Phew!” he gasped, jerking his hand away, “—hot!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And probably insecure.” Bill was beside him now. They were out of the line of fire from the door and windows. “I’ll tell you what—that ladder! Wait—” He picked up a small shovel from the hearth. “I’ll get these live coals into the scuttle. That should cool the chimney some.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sanborn helped with a tongs, and the coals were quickly transferred. Bill found a wall switch and turned off the light. Together they went to the window by which Bill had entered, and cautiously lifting the shade a couple of inches, they peered through the glass. Three men, revolvers in hand, were approaching the ladder across a flower bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Get ’em in the legs,” whispered Sanborn.\n\u003cbr\u003e 202\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two shots rang out like one, and two of the attackers dropped in their tracks. The third, evidently deciding that distance lent enchantment, streaked for the shadow of the trees without returning their fire. They let him go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill raised the window and they seized the topmost rung of the ladder and started to haul it into the library. It was half-way through the window when there came a flash from the corner of the house. The glass door of a bookcase was shattered, but neither Bill nor the detective paid any attention to it. A second more and the ladder was inside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sanborn mopped the perspiration from his brow. “Jiminy! That was close, Bill.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill nodded and stuck his head out of the window. “Lucky they can’t see us, sir. They might try to snipe us from behind the trees.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As though in answer to his challenge, without warning, the chandelier that hung from the ceiling in a spray of electric bulbs, sprang into light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Duck, Bill, duck!” A fusillade of shots rang out as the pair dropped to the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e 203\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill’s eyes fell upon the pile of black coal he had dumped from the scuttle before filling it with the hot ones from the grate. Motioning Sanborn to follow, he wormed his way to the hearth and picked up a good-sized piece of coal. He handed it to Sanborn and took a similar piece himself. Then he pointed to the electric bulbs, and winked cheerfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They hurled their missiles simultaneously. Bill’s was a bullseye but the detective’s fell short of the mark. With the “plop” and the tinkle of falling glass, one of the bulbs was out of action. Bill grabbed another coal and a moment later the room went dark again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good shooting, Bill.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not so worse. Now gimme a hand with the ladder, sir. We’ll push it up the chimney.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was easier said than done. The ladder was too long and the angle too acute.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never mind, Bill. We must chance it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 204\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ashton Sanborn felt the staple he had tried before. It was still warm, but bearable to the touch. “I’ll go first. It’s a good thing you wore gloves.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, but I wish they were leather, not cotton. Still, my hands feel all right.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s good. Got a handkerchief? Here’s mine. Stuff one inside each glove. They’ll protect the thin skin of your palms.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thanks. Gee, this is a wild party, isn’t it? I didn’t expect to be throwing coal at light bulbs—or stuffing handkerchiefs in my gloves—but say, sir, what about Lambert?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Lord! I’d almost forgotten him. Here, lend me a hand with the ladder. It will be useful after all. We don’t want our friend to topple over with the chair and let them in that way.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 205\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They placed the top of the ladder against the upper panel of the door and thrust the bound man’s head between two of the rungs. Then they jammed the foot of the ladder into one of the bookshelves, removing half a dozen books to make way for it. It fitted and held firmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good! Now, you keep the ladder nicely in position, Lambert,” warned the detective. “The chances are if they break down the door, they’ll break your neck. Sorry—but time means more than kindness just now. You weren’t too considerate of a certain young lady the other night, either. And it will probably save the state the price of a hangman—So long!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They left the silent figure and again essayed the ascent of the chimney. The air was almost stifling, but the staples held. Through clouds of soot dislodged by their progress, the two made their way upward. There came a slope in the angle of the chimney, and a dim square appeared overhead, a shade less dark than the blackness that enveloped them.\n\u003cbr\u003e 206\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sanborn felt for his electric torch, then remembered he had left it in his car. Feeling in his pockets, he finally produced a box of matches. After considerable trouble, he managed to strike one. The draught immediately extinguished it. The nearer they got to the top, however, the less dark the chimney seemed. Meanwhile he had to feel round for every staple, sending showers of soot upon Bill with every movement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again Sanborn felt the wall. Yes, there was no doubt about it. A good twenty feet to go, and no more staples. Well, there was nothing for it except to travel mountaineering fashion, back braced against one wall, feet against the other. It seemed simple enough, but when he attempted it, the chimney proved too wide, and he all but crashed onto Bill just below.\n\u003cbr\u003e 207\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A sudden gust of wind sent a cloud of smoke belching down the shaft. Sanborn shut his eyes and gripped the last staple. He could hear Bill coughing and spluttering down below, while the shaft slowly cleared. Then Sanborn discovered that just above his head the inlet of another chimney joined the main shaft. He decided that the smoke came from there. It must be passed, and quickly, for the air was foul enough without the addition of smoke. Again he tried to wriggle upward, but found that the heat and the fumes from the other shaft were too much for him. He eased down again to the comparative security of the staple. If he could manage to stand on that last staple, he might somehow get past the vomiting side vent. But even if the chimney narrowed above the other shaft, the smoke would be suffocating.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Buck up, sir!” Bill’s voice sounded thick and weary. “What’s the trouble?”\n\u003cbr\u003e 208\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sanborn told him. “Guess we’ll have to go down,” he began, then stopped as the sound of splintering wood reached their ears from the library, and a crash. A moment later there was a rush of feet and a cry as Fanely discovered that their prisoners were missing. There was further scurrying, then that high, menacing voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The chimney! That’s where they are!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment’s silence, then the sound of a shot reverberated deafeningly up the shaft. The chimney immediately filled with particles of soot scattered by the percussion. Both Bill and the detective mentally blessed that change in the angle of the chimney.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ah!—” again that hideous voice,—“I have an inspiration—yes, an inspiration. We shall—er—relight the fire!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sanborn swore under his breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, yes, relight the fire. And I think a little gasoline is indicated. Lambert, you are well enough to phone the garage for a can or two? Jacques, go fetch some paper and wood. No, wait a moment. Shovels can be used, there is one on the hearth—to transport the fire from the dining room fireplace. Peter, you stand here and shoot them if they come down.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 209\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For several minutes Bill and Sanborn clung to their precarious perches, each wracking his brain for a way out of this horrible snare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Listen!” cried Bill in a hoarse whisper. “Hold on tight. I’m going to climb up your body. Then I’ll get a foot on the top of the other shaft and haul you up. I can get on your shoulders again and get a grip on the top of the chimney. You can climb out and haul me after you. What do you think?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s a chance, Bill. And if we don’t smother in the attempt, it’s worth trying, anyway. Come ahead.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill pulled himself upward and over Sanborn’s body until he stood on the detective’s broad shoulders. Then he gasped in astonishment. The heat and smoke from the other chimney had subsided and the air was now bearable. The explanation came like a flash. This must be the outlet from the dining room, from which the fire had been removed. There was not a moment to lose.\n\u003cbr\u003e 210\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dropping his legs into the dining room shaft, he lay bellywise across the junction of the two openings and reached down toward Sanborn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hurry up, old sport,” he cried, gripping the detective’s extended hands. “That’s right—up you come!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But what—the smoke’s gone—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never mind that now—drop down this shaft beside me. It’s narrow enough to brace with your back and legs. And make it snappy, too, or you’ll get singed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ashton Sanborn swung back beside Bill. There was a subdued roar down the chimney. Then a sheet of flame shot upward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2718/74746.html","bookId":1423,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:58:19 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:58:19 AM"}
