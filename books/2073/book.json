Rowling, and a fictional book described in her Harry Potter series of novels. The real book purports to be a reproduction of a copy of the fictional book held in the Hogwarts library, written by Kennilworthy Whisp and Rowling is only listed in the book as the copyright holder of the \"Harry Potter\" name. In 2001 Rowling penned two companion books to the Harry Potter series, Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, for British charity and off-shoot of Live Aid, Comic Relief with all of her royalties going to the charity. As of July 2008, the books combined are estimated to have earned over $30 million for Comic Relief. The two books have since been made available in hardcover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/quidditch-through-the-ages.jpg","author":"J.K.
