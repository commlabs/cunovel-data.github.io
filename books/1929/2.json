Pre-made?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “It’s easy and fast, and they taste fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head again. “Show me to your baking supplies. I can’t stand by and watch this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at him. “You’re bossy for an out-of-work houseguest,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a job. Several actually. But yeah, I’m bossy. Now show me to your flour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept scowling, but I was walking from the kitchen and into the walk-in pantry while I did it. I waved a hand at the area that kind of held the baking supplies. The pantry was hardly well organized, so he would probably have to dig around to get everything he needed for cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left him to it, going back into the kitchen to pre-heat the oven and grease a cookie sheet. I put out a large mixing bowl, measuring cups, and any other incidentals I thought he might need for baking. It was the least I could do if he was actually going to do the baking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged out of my sweatshirt, suddenly warm. It was a hundred and ten degrees outside, but you wouldn’t know it by the way I normally froze inside of the A/C’d to death house. It wasn’t normal for me to get so warm inside for no reason at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wearing a thin white tank and sitting on the counter when Tristan strolled back into the kitchen, his arms full of baking supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set them on the counter near the mixing bowl, lining them up neatly. His biceps bulged with the smallest movement. It was fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Salt?” he asked me, his brow raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, trying to process what he’d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed behind me after a few awkward moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved towards me without a word, and I saw my folly then. The cupboard I’d pointed to was directly behind me. I should have just grabbed it for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t seem to mind, moving uncomfortably close to me to reach behind me. His upper chest got so close to my face that I could smell him. He smelled divine, so divine that I closed my eyes for a second to take it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to reach up, so his hip grazed my inner thigh as he shamelessly moved between my legs to get closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” he said, backing up, the salt in his hand. I saw his eyes flick briefly down my body before he turned away, setting the salt beside the other ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re the nanny, huh? You are not what I pictured when Jerry said he had a live-in nanny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at his back. “What did you picture?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t really know. I didn’t have a clear picture in my head. I just wasn’t expecting someone like you.” He turned his head to flick me another unreadable glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a very unfriendly look, offended, and a little wounded. “What is that supposed to mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing bad. Quit giving me evil eyes. Nannies just don’t usually look like you. You’re like what Hollywood would cast to be a nanny to add sex appeal to a movie. You’re sexy. Really sexy. Don’t play coy. You know you’re gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped glaring, but I was wary of the compliments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, okay?” he said, studying my face. “I’m not hitting on you, and I won’t. What are you, like eighteen? Way too young for me. I’m just stating facts. Normally women don’t appreciate other women as hot as you underfoot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glaring again. “I’m twenty-one, and Bev is my best friend. I’ve been working for them for two years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw up his hands, giving me an apologetic smile. “Sorry. I’m not trying to be a dick. It just surprised me that you were the nanny Jerry was telling me about. He gave me no hints that you were, well, hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you?” I asked him, still smarting from the too young comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty-six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not that old,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Just too old to be dating eighteen-year olds, or even twenty-one year olds. Frankly, though, I’m bad with women my own age, too, when it comes to relationships, which is why I don’t do them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t help it. I had to ask. “So what do you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hookups. Brief, casual hookups. How about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, pursing my lips at him. I couldn’t quite believe that we had jumped to this already. He was a man to be careful of, to be sure. “I do relationships. No exceptions. Never had a casual hookup in my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, measuring some flour into the mixing bowl. “Well, I guess that makes things less complicated. We’ll be friends, then.” He shot me a sidelong smile that was downright irresistible. I thought that this was one of the strangest conversations I’d ever had, being that we had just met. Only, it didn’t feel like we’d just met. He spoke to me like he’d known me forever, and it was hard to refuse anything he said in that low voice of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, giving him my own, rather begrudging smile. “Okay, friends, since we’ll be living under the same roof for the next week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, then. My first job as your friend will be to show you how to make the best chocolate chip cookies in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan walked me through every step of the cookie making process, and I pretended to pay attention, but that attention kept wandering to his spectacular arms while he worked. I barely kept my composure when he used the mixer, and I watched his ripped arms vibrate with the movement of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you catch that, Danika?” he asked me with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook myself out of it, looking at his face. “Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head at me, his smile widening. I found my eyes focusing on the shadow of a beard lining his jaw. I’d never found the unshaven look so attractive before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a little troublemaker,” he told me matter-of-factly, going back to his cookie dough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” I asked, and I wasn’t sad when he didn’t respond. We didn’t need to get into a conversation about Trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spooned little balls of his dough onto the cookie sheet very precisely. He slid the pan into the oven, setting the timer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like to go out?” he asked me as he washed his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t seem to take my eyes off his hands. “Go out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dried his hands and approached me, stopping just short of my legs. “Yeah. Go out. Like to bars and clubs and parties. What do you like to do for fun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to answer, but my mind was pretty blank. Fun? What did I do for fun? I kept busy, that was for sure, but was any of it strictly for fun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swim with the boys a lot. And I walk the dogs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked at me, and I wanted to smack my own forehead. I sounded like a weirdo, even to myself. “You swim with the boys and walk the dogs? When was the last time you went out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mulled that over, quickly coming to the conclusion that I would not admit how long it had been since I’d ‘gone out’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was saved from having to even attempt to answer by the swarm of dogs that invaded the kitchen. They had all followed Bev into her room, but had apparently finished saying their hellos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDot moved between Tristan and me, letting out a little warning growl, and taking his place to guard me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan studied the dogs, his hands moving to his hips as he took them in. “Are you going to introduce me?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t help it, my lip curled at him in a smirk. “You want me to introduce you to the dogs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, that easy smile of his in place. “If you don’t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed to Mango first. “That’s Mango. She’ll slobber on you, and get on top of you when you’re sleeping, but she’s the sweetest dog in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, moving to stroke his hands over the big dog. She was putty in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed to the next dog, a little, black and white lhasa-apso. “That little one is Pupcake. She’s the easy-going one, and the boys’ favorite.” He had her rolling onto her back in seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed to the spotted brown coon hound. “That one is Coffeecup. He’s the youngest, and he and I are working through some issues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed at the name, stroking the dog. Coffeecup licked his face, and he didn’t bat an eye. Son of a bitch. “Dare I ask about the issues, or is it a touchy subject?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s touchy,” I told him. The wild dog was driving me up the wall bonkers lately, and I didn’t want to explain all of the reasons why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed at Dot, who was nuzzling into my dangling leg. “This is Dot. He’s the guard dog of the bunch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan nodded, bending down to pet the dog, his hand not an inch away from my leg. Shockingly, Dot let him, his tail wagging, no snarl in sight, close proximity to me and all. What the fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you do that? Dot never takes to strangers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiggled his fingers at me. “Haven’t I told you? I have magic hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened, pulling a pack of cards out of his pocket. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t noticed them. I’d been enjoying how he fit into his jeans rather intently…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuffled the cards. I could tell by the way he handled them that he practiced a lot. His hands were big, which made the deft movements of his fingers more impressive, and more distracting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fanned the cards out, smiling at me. “Pick a card, any card.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched a brow at him sardonically. “Are we really doing this? Card tricks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his smile widening. “See, skeptics are my favorite. So much more room to blow your mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, but I picked a card, extracting it carefully, keeping it turned away from him. I almost rolled my eyes again when I saw that it was the Queen of Hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want a new card,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just laughed, shaking his head. “Just memorize it and put it back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, making sure he couldn’t see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started shuffling the cards again, not even glancing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve seen this trick before,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow furrowed, and cards started shooting from his hands, going everywhere. “Hm. You have?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, uncertain if throwing the cards everywhere had been part of the trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistled loudly. “Mango, bring her the card.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at the dogs, totally lost. “What the…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMango had a card in her mouth, and I bent down to her, holding a hand out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t eat cards, silly. That’s even worse than a stick of butter…” I trailed off as I pulled the Queen of Hearts out of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened, thrown for a loop. I raised my wide eyes to Tristan’s smug ones. “How on earth did you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiggled his fingers at me again. His magic hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jazz hands are hardly an answer,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had him doubled over laughing, and me smiling, because I already loved the sound of his laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously, how did you do that? How in the world did you have Mango in on the trick?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-things-tristan-danika-1/page-2.html","bookId":1929,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM"}
