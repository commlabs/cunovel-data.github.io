Wine ... brandy ... soft drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds smiles, a warm smile that I can tell is sincere. \"Surprise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom laughs, a sweet, soft laugh I haven\u0027t heard in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mom is in the kitchen, Mr. Reynolds turns to me. \"How is it back at school after being away for a year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"It\u0027s okay, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares out the window. Where\u0027s my mom? The clock on the fireplace mantle is ticking, each second a reminder of how time is passing so slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTick. Tick. Tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds rubs his hands together. I can tell he\u0027s as eager as I am for my mom to come back. Tick. Tick. Tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to excuse myself and hide in my room. I don\u0027t think I can handle watching my mom on a date with someone other than my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I\u0027m about to stand up and excuse myself, she comes in with three drinks and a big smile. \"Martinis for us, Sprite for Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds takes the glass from my mom. Their hands touch slightly when she hands it to him. I know I encouraged her to invite Mr. Reynolds over, but he\u0027s too big, too blonde, and ... and he\u0027s not my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom looks at me, her expression wary. \"Where are you going, sweetheart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To my room. I forgot to call Danielle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom has this puppy dog look on her face; I think she knows I\u0027m lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my room I open the top drawer of my desk. In an envelope I keep my dad\u0027s phone number. My hands are shaking as I dial his number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rings three times before he answers. \"Jerry Armstrong here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Urn ... Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s my little girl holding up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your leg? The last time we talked you were having a bit of trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels good to talk to my dad. Hearing his familiar voice takes away the black cloud that always seems to hover over me. I don\u0027t want to tell him the truth about my leg because I only want to share good news. If I\u0027m positive, then maybe he won\u0027t want to forget I\u0027m his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. And school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow the reality and say as cheerfully as I can, \"Perfect. I\u0027m getting all As,\" I lie. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s silence, but I don\u0027t want him to hang up. I feel desperate. He sounds enthusiastic, but I\u0027m not sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your mother doing?\" he finally says, breaking the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s currently having a date with her boss in our living room. She\u0027s fine. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to hear it. I miss you, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss you, too. When can I see you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how many times I promise myself I won\u0027t beg him, I fail. It\u0027s like something inside me snaps when I think he\u0027s going to end the conversation. I want to yell, Aren\u0027t I good enough? but I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometime soon, when business settles down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black cloud returns--I\u0027ve heard those exact words before. Too many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, can you do me a favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m holding back tears as I say, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell your mother I sent her a check last week. And to have her lawyer stop calling mine. It\u0027s costing me a fortune every time he calls, like a hundred and fifty an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else is talking in the background and I can tell I\u0027m losing his attention. \"I have to take another call, sweetheart. I\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s important. I\u0027ll call you soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I love you, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love you too, Mags.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard and lean my head back against the wall. As much as I tell myself not to, I\u0027m crying. I\u0027d love to throw myself onto my bed and sob into my pillow, but Mom\u0027ll probably hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rings, startling me. I\u0027m still holding the cordless in my hand. Could it be my dad calling back so soon? He always says he\u0027ll call but never does. Maybe he\u0027s changed. Maybe he realizes after hearing my voice he misses me so much he can\u0027t stand it anymore. \"Hello?\" I say excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a hesitation on the line, then a female voice recording says, \"This is High Spring Water Company reminding you that there\u0027s a special on our five-gallon water bottles for the month of October. If you\u0027d like to order--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang up the phone in the middle of the recording. God, I feel so alone. There\u0027s nobody in my life who remotely understands what I\u0027ve been going through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept one person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers dial the Becker\u0027s number automatically before my brain can comprehend what I\u0027m doing. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s him--Caleb. I don\u0027t even know what to say. \"Maggie? I know it\u0027s you, we have caller ID.\" I forgot about that. \"Hi,\" I mumble. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears come to my eyes. \"I just... wanted to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you crying? Are you hurt? Did you fall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t talk because I don\u0027t want him to know how weak I am ... how much I need his friendship right now. God, all those years I thought I would die if he didn\u0027t love me as much as I loved him. But now I realize how stupid I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t answer me, I\u0027m coming over whether your mom\u0027s there or not.\" His voice is hard and commanding, and I know he means it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t come over. Can you meet me at Paradise Park in ten minutes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there,\" he promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the sleeve of my shirt and wipe at my eyes. \"Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI splash water on my eyes in the bathroom, tell my mom that I\u0027m going over to Danielle\u0027s, and head for the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb walks up a minute later wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a plain button-down shirt over it. He slows his stride when he sees me and, without a word, pulls me into an embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m losing it, right into his shirt. I clutch onto him as the sobs start and don\u0027t stop. I let it all out--my mom\u0027s date, my dad\u0027s conversation, my confusion about it all. Caleb doesn\u0027t laugh, he doesn\u0027t pull away, he doesn\u0027t talk ... he just lets me be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I settle down, I lean back and witness the mess I\u0027ve made on his shirt. \"I made your shirt all gross,\" I say between sniffles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget the shirt. What\u0027s going on? I couldn\u0027t understand a word you mumbled into my chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m half laughing and half crying. He looks down at my hand. I do, too. He slowly reaches out and takes my fingers in his. God, how I dreamed of us holding hands all those years ago. He\u0027d take my hand in his and we\u0027d walk down the street together. I look up at his eyes. Usually they\u0027re dark and brooding, but now I see a warmth there I\u0027d never noticed before. He leads me to the old oak. We both sit down, then he leans back against the tree right next to me and lets go of my hand. \"Okay, now talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s easy because I don\u0027t have to look at him, I can just spurt out all the stuff that\u0027s going wrong in my life. I take a deep breath. I\u0027m going to attempt to say it all without going into hysterics again. \"My mom has a date over, her boss and Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 son. I think my mom likes him, but I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready for her to start dating. I know it\u0027s selfish, but my dad has practically ignored me ever since the divorce. He\u0027s re-married, you know. And I think his wife wants a kid, as if he doesn\u0027t already have one. To top it off, my doctor said I should play tennis again, and every time I think about it my throat starts constricting and I have to remember to breathe ... and then I call you because you\u0027re the only one I feel I can talk to. Which is ridiculous because its you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb plays with a piece of grass he\u0027s plucked from the ground. \"Do you think your mom would be happy with this boss guy?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think back to the way Mom laughed at the Fall Festival and how nervous she was tonight. \"Yeah, I do. But that\u0027s the part that scares me. It\u0027s like ending a chapter in your life and starting over. A single mom, boyfriends ... so much has changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re stressing too much about what might be. Do something to take your mind off thinking about what might never happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick up a racquet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not funny,\" I say, already stressing and wanting to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not trying to be funny, Maggie.\" I hear him sigh, a low breath that comes out slow. \"Can I see your scars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God. \"No.\" I shake my head feverishly while still staring at the ground. And I\u0027m aware that my breathing just got heavier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t freak out on me.\" I\u0027m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. I went to jail for doing something to you and I have no clue what it looks like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head and I\u0027m staring into his eyes, darker and more intense than I\u0027ve ever seen them. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember the accident?\" he asks, totally focused on my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember nothing? Our conversation before the accident, me hitting you with the car? Nothing at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s a big blank. I only know what people told me.\" He blinks, then looks away. \"We fought, you and I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives a short, cynical laugh. \"Kendra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trying to breathe evenly so I don\u0027t give him a hint that I do remember. Every word he spat at me when I told him I loved him. It\u0027s the only part of that night that\u0027s crystal clear to me. The rest is stuck in a foggy haze. \"I don\u0027t remember,\" I lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said she was cheating on me, that you saw her with some other guy but you wouldn\u0027t tell me who. You were right, you know,\" he says. \"She was with Brian before I got put in jail.\" He\u0027s staring at me again, and this time I can\u0027t look away. \"You also said you loved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, still mesmerized by his eyes. Those eyes that never gave me more than a glance a year ago are burning into mine. \"I don\u0027t remember,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie--\" He takes my hand in his and places my palm against his cheek roughened with a day\u0027s worth of stubble. He turns his head and kisses the inner, sensitive part of my palm, his eyes holding my gaze. \"I should have done this a year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart flips over as he leans in and touches his lips to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t sleep last night, which is nothing new because every night is filled with restlessness. But last night it wasn\u0027t nightmares of jail keeping me awake, or the night of the accident and what I could have done differently. I was reliving what happened a few hours ago. Kissing Maggie was the stupidest thing I\u0027ve ever done. But, looking into her sad eyes and vulnerable face made me want her more than I\u0027ve ever wanted anything in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night real emotions were flying. Last night honesty was flying. It felt so raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m getting ready for school, I think about our conversation after the kiss. She was nervous, I could tell by the shaking of those lips against mine. She\u0027d closed her eyes and clutched at me as our lips met. I swear I\u0027ve never been more turned on. When I leaned back, she had a worried look on her face as if I was going to give her a flunking grade on her kissing skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe that happened, she\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even know how I responded. All I remember is this feeling of stupidity washing over me, and wondering what the hell made me kiss a girl I should avoid getting close to at all costs. But being close to her felt so damn right, I couldn\u0027t resist her. We\u0027ve been through so much, our lives are meshed and we\u0027re stuck in this web together. The sick thing is, I don\u0027t want to get out of it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-20.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
