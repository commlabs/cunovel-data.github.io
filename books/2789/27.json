Princess Alex swore up and down tins was just a phase of her brother\u0027s ... Chris fervently hoped it was true. Sure, the kid had lost a bet... a year ago! How long was he supposed to spout poetry? Poor bastard. Unless he secretly liked it. In which case, weird bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crown Princess Victoria, Sweden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello... thanks for coming, Princess Victoria... did you like Yale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed I did,\" the princess replied with a kind smile. Another gorgeous brunette with brown eyes... and wearing pink!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friend Jenny says you\u0027re going to be Sweden\u0027s first female sovereign in, like, a million years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three hundred years, and yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good luck with that whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to you, Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princess Stephanie, Monaco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations,\" Princess Stephanie said, shaking her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to you, too,\" Christina replied. She\u0027d read in Newsweek that Stephie got around . .. she\u0027d just gotten married for the fourth?—fifth?—time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Princess Christina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Christina,\" she said, \"will be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I hear,\" Stephanie replied, and her eyes twinkled merrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost done,\" Jenny said in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God... hi, Ms. Beckinsale. I loved Underworld. You kicked ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Kate Beckinsale replied gravely. \"I\u0027m so glad you enjoyed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoyed it? I loved it! Great accent, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeckinsale blinked. \"I\u0027m British.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Well, then, no wonder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just wrapped the sequel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that\u0027s the best news I\u0027ve heard all year!\" she cried, and people up and down the receiving line laughed. With her, not at her. Sometimes it could be hard to tell, but not today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina was eating an open-faced cucumber sandwich with her salmon. Mmm! What was it about cukes and salmon that they went so well together? Who knew? It was one of those mysteries, like Stonehenge. But she meant to enjoy it all the same. And she chortled with delight every time she saw the guest favors ... miniature wedding cakes exactly like her big one, except only two inches high, in a rainbow of pastels. Each table was littered with pink, or mint green, or baby blue, or cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought you\u0027d like those,\" David said beside her. His plate was clean, and he was watching her shovel it in, looking amused. \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more in the kitchen, darling wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho-ho. I was too nervous to eat a thing today. Between Edmund nagging and Jenny hovering, I was, like, totally worried that hurling was imminent. On television, no less!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you avoided it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the food is great. As in couldn\u0027t-have-done-it-better-myself great Although I certainly tried, but the chefs wouldn\u0027t let me near the kitchen as of seventy-two hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They might have had instructions,\" Prince David admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you to enjoy your wedding reception. Tough to do if you\u0027re obsessing over the number of egg yolks in the butter cream frosting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shows what you know about butter cream,\" she grumbled, but she was pleased. \"And is it me, or is Queen Rania a total babe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of babes, or babies, rather—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, were we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—I threw away my birth control pills yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly put his wineglass down before he choked. \"All right. I, um, I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027m supposed to respond to that. Congratulations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. All those classes on Alaskan history that Edmund gave me. They were endless, but mildly interesting. I learned a lot about your ancestors. And we talked about the succession and the royal family and that you need an heir to, y\u0027know, be the boss of Alaska when we\u0027re worm food—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but you don\u0027t have to get pregnant this second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good, because I\u0027m not done with my cake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her. \"I meant, you flighty creature, that we can certainly wait awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Really? I thought having babies was my job now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he did choke on his wine. \"Who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured it out on my own. Come on, don\u0027t pretend we\u0027re like a regular married couple.\" She crossed her legs and leaned forward, her cape tenting on the floor around her. \"Don\u0027t you need babies, like, A.S.A.P.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Christina. You\u0027re young, I\u0027m young. We can wait awhile. If you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, well, I\u0027ll think about it.\" And she would. Most curious! She thought he\u0027d be on board with the Insta-Baby program, but he clearly was in no rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was that heartening and disappointing at the same time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of jobs—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, were we?\" she asked sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—have you thought about writing a cookbook? You seem to have very strong opinions about, for instance, omelets—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just makes me crazy when people dilute their eggs with milk!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—right, right, calm down and eat your cake. You could write a cookbook—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not now I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked. \"Why in the world not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it would be a cinch to get it published, and there\u0027d be a big print run—like, a zillion copies—but I\u0027d never know if the book was a success because people liked my ideas and my recipes, or because I was—drumroll, please—Princess Christina! You see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I do see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see he, in fact, did not see. Since he had always been a prince, he had been able to take his fame and popularity at face value. It was always there, like the moon and the sun. She would never be able to do that. She was well aware that for the rest of her life, people would want to be her friend because she was (insert snicker here) a princess. It was stupid, but there you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s talk about it later,\" she suggested. \"It\u0027s our wedding reception—we should probably be having fun. Or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am having fun,\" he said mildly, and forked the last bite of cake off her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Creep. You—what\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a mild tumult and looked up to see Kurt\u0027s way being blocked by at least three security people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell? Those guys know who Kurt is— what\u0027s with the \u0027can we see some I.D.\u0027 treatment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" the prince said casually, \"I might have accidentally put Detective Carlson\u0027s name on a list somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real mature, Penguin Boy. Hey! Guys!\" She waved. \"Let him come over, it\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, man,\" Kurt said to the head of security, exaggeratedly straightening his tux, \"I knew the bride when she used to rock \u0027n\u0027 roll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly more than one list,\" the prince added, downing the last of his wine in three gulps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Childish much?\" she muttered, then gave Kurt a big smile. \"Hey! Glad you could make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t gonna miss the royal wedding of the century,\" he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t start with that. We\u0027re barely even into the century. My God, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen you in a suit. You look great!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edmund made me.\" Kurt ran a finger around his collar and grimaced. \"I feel like a total fraud in this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get enough to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, Chris. Food\u0027s first-rate. Listen, the reason I came over—me and Prince Alex and a coupie of the guys are gonna go hit a few bars. I just wanted to say good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thanks for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look great,\" he said, looking up and down in that old half-critical, half-admiring way. \"Like a princess, for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then my disguise is working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and bent to kiss her cheek, then eyed the prince and shook her hand instead. \"Well, best of luck and all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you come tomorrow to see us off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. New York, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, great. See you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Bye. See you around, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night,\" the prince said coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David,\" Christina said, watching Kurt walk away, \"you\u0027ve really got to let that go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s faded into the mists of my memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Sure it has. Speaking of stuff fading into the mist...\" She put down her fork and plucked at his sleeve. \"I didn\u0027t get a chance earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too late to take it back,\" he said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny. Anyway, I didn\u0027t get a chance earlier, and I didn\u0027t know earlier. About the jewelry. The necklaces and the earrings and my engagement ring and the wedding bands. I didn\u0027t know you designed them yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked puzzled. There was a bit of cream cheese at the corner of his mouth; she reached up and thumbed it away. \"I told you I was going to take care of the jewelry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but I thought that meant, \u0027Edmund, take care of the jewelry,\u0027 or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitched on one side. \"Well, it didn\u0027t. And if I ordered Edmund to \u0027take care of anything, he\u0027d likely laugh in my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still. All the same. I didn\u0027t know, and I\u0027m sorry about all the ones I rejected.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-27.html","bookId":2789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM"}
