After all I\u0027ve accomplished, coaching high school football should be easy...but when you\u0027ve got a distraction in the form of a nerdy girl with curves, things can get complicated. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s a student, she\u0027s barely legal, and she\u0027s my best friendâ€™s daughter. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what desire was until Megan. I had no idea obsession could drive someone insane, until I saw her. I wasn\u0027t prepared for the fact that once I laid eyes on Megan my life would really begin. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI have to have her, no matter what the cost. I have to breed her and bind her to me so tightly she can\u0027t ever get away. She\u0027ll be mine, even if I have to take her. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWarning: this book is ridiculous, over the top, completely unbelievable, and pretty much just about breeding the heroine.
