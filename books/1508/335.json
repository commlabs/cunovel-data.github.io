Lin Ming carried the Purple Comet Spear and walked towards the flames. With a wave of his hand, an invisible energy rushed forth, dividing the flames and revealing a passageway.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Sludge Monster had already stopped struggling.

Whether it was for alchemy or for countering poisons, the Sludge Monster’s core pearl would be an extremely good material. Naturally, Lin Ming wouldn’t leave it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Sludge Monster’s sinews were also a good material. But the Sludge Monster had been slashed apart by Lin Ming, and had also been charred black. These sinews no longer had any value.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe flames separated into a path as Lin Ming carried his Purple Comet Spear and walked out from the blazing inferno, his spearpoint leading the way. At this time, his hair was loose, and he was covered in residual arcs of purple lightning and flame. At this moment, he looked like a peerless demon god.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe person closest to Lin Ming was the yellow-clothed youth from the Moon Seizing Sect. The yellow clothed-youth was slumped on the ground, exhausted. As he watched Lin Ming emerge from the fire, his lips twitched, and his eyes were blank like he had lost his soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe thought that Lin Ming was inviting death with that spear of his, but he never imagined that a single blow was able to kill the Sludge Monster…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a fifth-level vicious beast, whose strength was comparable to a peak Houtian martial artist. As for Lin Ming, his cultivation was only at the mere middle Pulse Condensation period!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWho was he?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe yellow-clothed youth was very clear just how terrifying it was to have this strength at this cultivation, and at such a young age!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was impossible for him to be unknown.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, he heard a rallying cry spread through the entire army, as if it were an endless tide.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Long live Hero Lin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Long live Hero Lin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Long live Hero Lin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Long live Hero Lin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo an ordinary soldier, Lin Ming was their benefactor and also their savior. Without Lin Ming, not only would they have died, but all their family that stood behind them would have been turned to bones by the vicious beast tide.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSurname Lin… His surname was Lin…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA 16 year old genius surnamed Lin… a name suddenly popped up in the yellow-clothed youth’s heart, causing him to be completely petrified. He sat on the ground like a statue, watching as Lin Ming walked past him…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe cheers continued. Lin Ming looked in the distance to see that the soldiers were all bloodied, but they were cheering in high spirits, and his mood became complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this battle, the ones that had the greatest impact were the masters. But, if these soldiers hadn’t used their own bodies to create a wall of flesh and blood to block off the beast tide, then no matter how strong Lin Ming was, or how many vicious beast he killed, they would have broken into Green Mulberry City and killed innocents.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this fight, these ordinary soldiers had paid the greatest cost, but the cheers and accolades they received were the least.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe even saw a soldier who had lost his arm in battle. After a simple wrap to staunch the bleeding, this soldier used all of his weary strength to raise his right arm, saluting Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, Lin Ming’s heart suddenly felt heavy. This was a war of mortals. In an army that was once 10,000 strong, there were now only a few thousand left. To the soldiers, being able to survive, or knowing that their families were safe, was already the best possible result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThinking of the culprit that was behind this entire farce – the South Sea Demon Region, Lin Ming’s mind and heart filled with waves of surging hatred.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo a lofty fifth-grade sect, the lives of mortals were no different than ants.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn order to swallow Divine Phoenix Island and the South Horizon Region, and to warn the 19 third-grade sects, the South Sea Demon Region didn’t hesitate for a second before setting off a terrifying beast tide that embroiled the entire Divine Phoenix Province. Because of their actions, death reigned everywhere, and countless innocent lives were lost.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming walked towards the army camp and hadn’t even arrived when he was swarmed by people. They were all being led by high level people of Green Mulberry City such as Lin Wanshan and Zhuang Fan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat vivid image of Lin Ming killing the Sludge Monster with a single strike of his spear could be described as a miracle. The monster was the size of a hill, but was stabbed to death with a single move. Purple lightning and roaring flames had impacted the heavens; this had left a greatly humbling impact upon everyone watching.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Salt Clan’s Shi Linkai had a very ruddy complexion, red with excitement. He laughed loudly and said, “Hero Lin, you are truly a war god reincarnate!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe was ready to let out some more praise, when he found that something didn’t seem right about Lin Ming’s condition.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hero Lin, is everything alright?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming waved his hand and said, “I’m good. I just need to rest for a moment.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had only consumed too much energy; it wasn’t because he was injured by the Sludge Monster. The Sludge Monster had a great deal of corrosive mucus in its body, but most of it was burnt away by the power of thunder and fire. As for the rest, it wasn’t able to melt through Lin Ming’s protective true essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, a white-clothed girl came out from the crowd. Her delicate red lips parted, and she carefully called out, “Sir Lin.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis girl was Lan Yi. She had seen all she needed in that brief moment to confirm that this was Lin Ming. Within all of the talents of the 19 third-grade sects, who could display this level of power besides Lin Ming?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fact, according to Lan Yi’s impression, Lin Ming should not have had this amount of terrifying combat strength. This was not strength that a Pulse Condensation period martial artist should have. In fact, there were even certain elders within the Moon Seizing Sect that couldn’t match up. The Moon Seizing Sect was a relatively weak and small sect, and some of the outer court elders were only at the peak Houtian realm. Their attack power would never reach this level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a 16 year to have attack power that compared favorably to an outer court elder of the Moon Seizing Sect… Lin Ming truly deserved his title as the top talent and young genius within the 19 third-grade sects.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Yi never expected that she would meet Lin Ming in such a remote mortal city. Naturally, she would not miss this rare opportunity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked up at Lan Yi, “What’s the matter?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, Lin Ming was able to confirm that Lan Yi had recognized him. The reason she repeatedly approached him must be because she had some matter to discuss.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Sir Lin, this is a Blue Lotus Pill, it can help you recover your strength.” As Lan Yi spoke, she took out a small bottle from her spatial ring. A rich aroma emitted from the pill – it was indeed a top-grade pill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t need it.” Lin Ming waved, “I already have pills. If Miss Lan has any matters to discuss, please speak frankly.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a moment, Lan Yi seemed somewhat embarrassed. To brazenly and openly ask others for help was quite difficult.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, Shi Linkai also revealed a mischievous smile, his eyes lighting up with a ‘hehe’ expression. He gave Lin Ming a meaningful glance, silently saying ‘Brother, you are very fierce!’, and quickly excused himself and left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eObviously, to Shi Linkai, Lan Yi was infatuated with Lin Ming. To him, this was a completely normal matter. After all, beautiful women loved heroes, the two were of a similar age, and Lin Ming had an attractive aura to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Shi Linkai thought that he was being clever, this caused Lan Yi to be even more embarrassed. She coughed and said, “Sir Lin, I would like to request a favor, may I speak with you alone?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright, let’s go to the army compound.” Lin Ming also wanted to understand how the Moon Seizing Sect was attacked, so he didn’t reject her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-332\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-334\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-333","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM"}
