It’s gone. There’s a gas station there now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick nodded. “Yeah. They put that up about five years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive years ago? I stared at him, dumbfounded. “What...well, what happened to the house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea why I asked that; what I really wanted to know was what had happened to my family. Why had they left? Where had they gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBainbridge was behind this, I just knew it. After he’d taken care of me, he’d gone after my family next. Shit. I should’ve known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Man...” Pick shook his head slowly. Regret filled his eyes. “Did no one tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he watched me, sympathetic and worried, made my skin itch. It had always prickled the same way in prison right before someone jumped me. Heeding the warning, I tightened my muscles, bracing for impact. “Tell me what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The, uh...the house burned. There was a house fire. It burned all the way to the ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him so hard he winced and glanced away. That wasn’t all, I realized. There was more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And my family?” I said slowly. My chest heaved, telling me my breathing had picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother grimace clouded Pick’s face. I took a step back, not ready to hear this. But then he met my gaze and solemnly said, “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutched my stomach and doubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, shit,” Ten breathed. His sympathetic curse after being a total douche to me only made my urge to puke increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrated on breathing through my mouth as the nausea mounted. “All of them?” I choked out. My entire fucking family? Gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most of them,” Pick said, his voice low. “Your mom. Your sister. Your niece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sobbed out a miniature moan and immediately jammed my fist against my teeth to muffle anything else that might try to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Pick kept going. “And one of your brothers. I’m sorry, I don’t remember which one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded as if it was okay, but it wasn’t okay. Nothing was okay. My stomach certainly wasn’t okay. I dashed to the backside of Zoey’s car, braced my hand against the trunk and leaned over to vomit, but nothing came up except the taste of acid, which sucked more than if I could actually puke because it didn’t settle my nausea any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me, Ten said, “Holy fuck, no one bothered to tell him half his fucking family died in a house fire? Man, that’s harsh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring him, I stooped there another minute until I felt safe enough to stand. But as soon as I straightened, the queasiness returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Pick from unfocused eyes. “What about the rest of them?” I asked, my gravelly voice even rougher than usual. “Do you know where they are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth, shut it, and then winced before shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew; he just didn’t want to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dad,” he started slowly. “Got drunk out by the train yard a few years later. He was hit and...died. Then one of your brothers—again, I’m not sure which one—overdosed on drugs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed up air hard through my nostrils and nodded. “And the other two?” I asked, not looking at him. “The rest of my brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “I don’t know. They went into foster care for a while and then went their own way. I have no idea where they are now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing out a long breath, I bowed my head and reassured myself that I most likely still had two brothers out there somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long have you been out?” Pick asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. “About an hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit.” He sighed. “And you obviously have no place to go since you went home, only to find it...not there. Did you have anywhere else in mind to stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around the parking lot as if seeking a shelter, but all I saw was a sea of cars. So I shook my head. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I thought. Look, Ten and I were going to go inside and wait for some word about Zoey and the baby, but I can take you somewhere to crash for a few days until you get on your feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked at him, not sure why he was so willing to help me. I couldn’t offer him anything in return. I had nothing. And no one gave shit away for free. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-16.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
