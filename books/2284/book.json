And one of the most haunted places in Savannah is a tavern called The Dragonslayer, built in the 1750s. The current owner, Gus Anderson, is a descendant of the original innkeeper and his pirate brother, Blue. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eGus summons his granddaughter, Abigail, home from Virginia, where she\u0027s studying at the FBI Academy. When she arrives, she\u0027s devastated to find him dead. Murdered. But Abby soon learns that Gus isn\u0027t the only one to meet a brutal and untimely end; there\u0027ve been at least two other victims. Then Captain Blue Anderson starts making ghostly appearances, and the FBI\u0027s paranormal investigation unit, the Krewe of Hunters, sends in Agent Malachi Gordon. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAbby and Malachi have a similar ability to connect with the dead... and a similar stubbornness. Sparks immediately begin to fly â€” sparks of attraction and discord. But as the death toll rises, they have to trust each other or they, too, might find themselves among the dead haunting old Savannah!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-night-is-alive-krewe-of-hunters-10.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-alive-krewe-of-hunters-10.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:54 PM"}
