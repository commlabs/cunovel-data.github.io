Dougless saw that, three seats down from Kit was Nicholas, and he was in serious conversation with a tall, dark-haired woman who wasn’t beautiful exactly but very handsome. For a moment, Dougless stared at the woman, thinking that she’d seen her before, but she couldn’t place her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning away, she looked at the other people and thought how odd it was to see women without makeup, but the women obviously took care of their skin. They didn’t just get up, wash their faces, and go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of Nicholas was the French heiress who was to marry Kit. The girl sat quietly, her lower lip stuck out, a frown on her plain face. No one spoke to her, but she didn’t seem to mind. Behind her hovered a fierce-looking older woman who, when the girl knocked her napkin askew, straightened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless caught the girl’s eye and smiled, but the girl glowered back, and the hovering woman looked as though Dougless had threatened her charge. Dougless turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the food arrived, Dougless saw that it was presented with great ceremony. And cooking like this deserved ceremony. The first course of meat was brought in on enormous silver trays: roast beef, veal, mutton, salted beef. Wine, which was kept cool in copper tubs of cold water, was poured into jewel-colored, translucent goblets of Venetian glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next course was fowl: turkey, boiled capon, chicken stewed with leeks, partridge, pheasant, quail, woodcock. Next came fish: sole, turbot, whiting, lobster, crayfish, eels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seemed to be cooked in a sauce, all of it highly spiced and delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVegetables came next: turnips, green peas, cucumbers, carrots, spinach. Dougless did not find the vegetables as good as the other courses because they had been cooked to a pulp. When she asked, she was told that vegetables must be cooked thoroughly to remove the poisons from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every course a different wine was served, and servants rinsed the glasses before filling them with the next wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalads came after the vegetables. Not salads as she knew them but cooked lettuce and even cooked violet buds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dougless was so full she felt like lying down and sleeping the afternoon away, dessert was brought in. There were almond tarts and pies of nearly every fruit imaginable, and there were cheeses that ranged from creamy to hard. The fat, sun-warmed strawberries were more flavorful than any Dougless had ever tasted in the modern world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once Dougless was thankful for her steel corset, which kept her from gorging herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the meal the ewer of water was brought around again because the food had been eaten with spoons and fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, after three hours, the group broke up and Dougless waddled up the stairs to Honoria’s room and flopped on the bed. “I am dying,” she said woefully. “I’ll never be able to walk again. And to think I expected Nicholas to be happy with a club sandwich for lunch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria laughed at her. “Now we must attend Lady Margaret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless soon found out that the Elizabethan people worked as hard as they ate. With her hand on her full belly, Dougless followed Honoria downstairs, through a beautiful knot garden, and out to the stables. Dougless was helped onto a horse with a sidesaddle, which she had a great deal of trouble holding on to; then Lady Margaret, her five women and four male guards wearing swords and daggers, set off at a mad pace. Dougless had a hard time keeping up because she was so unbalanced, with one leg hooked over a tall wooden pommel and the other in a short stirrup. Dougless knew her Colorado cousins wouldn’t be very proud of her because she used both hands to hold on to the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have no horses in Lanconia?” one of the men asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Horses, yes; sidesaddles, no,” she answered as she held on fearfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter about an hour she began to feel less like she was going to fall off at any second, so she could look around her. Going from the beautiful Stafford house to the English countryside was like going from a fairy castle to a slum, or maybe from Beverley Hills to Calcutta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleanliness was not part of the villagers’ lives. Animals and people lived in the same buildings and on the same sanitary level. Kitchen and privy slops were thrown outside the doors of the dark little houses. The people were as dirty as only years’ worth of dirt and sweat could make them. Their clothes were coarse and stiff with grease and use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd diseases! Dougless stared at the people they passed. They were marked with smallpox; they had neck goiter, ringworm, running sores on their faces. Many times she saw crippled and maimed people. And no one over the age of ten seemed to have all his teeth—and the ones they did have were usually black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless’s huge lunch threatened to come up. What made her feel worse than the sights and smells was the fact that most of the illnesses could be cured with modern medicine. As she rode, holding on to the saddle, she could see that there were very few people past the age of thirty, and it occurred to Dougless that had she been born in the sixteenth century, she wouldn’t have lived past ten years old. At ten her appendix had ruptured and she’d required emergency surgery. There was no surgery in the sixteenth century. But then she probably wouldn’t even have survived birth because Dougless had been a breech birth and her mother had hemorrhaged. As she thought about this, she looked at these people with new eyes. These people were the survivors, the healthiest of the healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lady Margaret’s group rode by, the villagers came out of their huts or stopped working in the fields to stare at the procession of beautifully dressed people on their sleek horses. Lady Margaret and her attendants waved to the villagers, and the villagers grinned back. We’re rock stars, movie stars, and royalty all rolled into one, Dougless thought, and she waved at the people too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode for what seemed to be hours to Dougless’s sore backside and cramped legs before they halted in a pretty little meadow that overlooked a field full of grazing sheep. One of the grooms helped Dougless from her horse, and she limped to where Honoria sat on a cloth on the damp ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have enjoyed the ride?” Honoria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About as much as measles and whooping cough,” Dougless murmured. “I take it Lady Margaret is over her flu?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is a most energetic woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in companionable silence for a while, Dougless looking at the pretty view and trying not to think of her encounter with Nicholas the night before. She asked Honoria what a callet was and found out it was a lewd woman. Dougless bit her tongue on renewed anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a cater-cousin?” she asked Honoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A friend of the heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless sighed. So Nicholas and Robert Sydney were “friends of the heart.” No wonder Nicholas would believe nothing bad about the man. Some friendship, she thought. Nicholas rolls about on the table with Robert’s wife, and Robert plots to have his friend executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Robert Sydney is a pillicock,” Dougless muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria looked shocked. “You know him? You care for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know him, and I certainly don’t care for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria looked so puzzled that Dougless asked what a pillicock was. “It is a term of endearment; it means a pretty rogue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Endearment? But—” She broke off. When Nicholas had asked her to return to the sixteenth century to cook for him and she’d been so angry, she’d called him rotten names and Nicholas had supplied “pillicock” to the list. He must have loved hearing an angry woman call him a term of endearment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled in memory. He could indeed be a pillicock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the women, who was a maid to a maid to Lady Margaret, passed about little cookies made of crushed almonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMunching, Dougless asked, “Who was the handsome dark-haired woman sitting next to Nicholas at dinner today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Arabella Sydney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless choked and coughed, sputtering crumbs. “Lady Arabella? Has she been here long? When did she come? When will she leave?” The postcard, Dougless thought. That’s where she’d seen the woman: in the portrait on the postcard she’d bought at Bellwood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria smiled. “She arrived yester eve and leaves early on the morrow. She journeys with her husband to France. They will not return for years, so she came to bid my Lady Margaret farewell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless’s mind raced. If Nicholas hadn’t had Arabella on the table yet and tomorrow Arabella left, then this had to be the day. She had to stop it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, she doubled over, her hands on her stomach, and began to groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What ails you?” Honoria asked, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something I ate. I must return to the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—” Honoria began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must.” Dougless gave a few more groans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly, Honoria went to Lady Margaret and returned in a few minutes. “We have permission. I will accompany you with one groom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. Let’s just go fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria looked confused as Dougless hurried toward the horses. As a groom helped her onto the saddle, Dougless didn’t look at all ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless would have thrown her leg over the idiot sidesaddle, but there was no stirrup on one side, so she tightened her leg around the big protrusion in the front, took a little riding crop, and applied it to the horse’s flanks. Leaning forward, she hung on as the horse thundered down the rutted, dirty road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her came the groom and Honoria, doing their best to keep up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice Dougless had to make the horse jump, once over a wagon tongue, once over a small wooden wheelbarrel. She reined in sharply as a child ran across the road and managed to miss him. She ran through a flock of geese that set up a terrible clatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she reached the house, she leaped from the saddle, tripped on the heavy skirts, and fell face forward. But she didn’t waste a moment as she got up and began running, flinging open the gate, then running down the brick walk and up the stairs, across the terrace and in through the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she was inside the house, she stopped and stared up at the staircase. Where? Where was Nicholas? Arabella? The table?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her left came voices, and when she heard Kit, she ran to him. “Do you know where there’s a table, about six feet long, three feet wide? The legs are turned in a spiral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKit smiled at the urgency in her voice—and at the wild look of her. Her face was running with perspiration, her cap was half off, and her auburn hair was falling about her shoulders. “We have many such tables.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This one is special.” She was trying to remain calm, but she couldn’t quite do it. And she was trying to breathe, but the corset was constricting her lungs. “It’s in a room Nicholas uses, and there’s a closet in the room, a place big enough that two people can hide in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Closet?” Kit said, puzzled, and Dougless realized that a closet in Elizabethan England wasn’t a place to hang clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn older man behind Kit whispered something to him, and Kit smiled. “The chamber next to Nicholas’s bedchamber has such a table. He often—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless didn’t hear the rest. Tossing her skirt and petticoats over her arm, she ran up the stairs. Nicholas’s bedroom was two rooms down on the right and next to it was a door. She tried the handle, but it was locked. She ran into his bedroom, and through it, but the connecting door was also locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe banged on the door with her open palms. “Nicholas! If you’re in there, let me in. Nicholas! Do you hear me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could swear she heard sounds inside the room. “Nicholas!” she screamed as she pounded and kicked the door. “Nicholas!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he opened the door, he had a lethal-looking dagger in his hand. “Is my mother well?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless pushed past him. There, against the wall was the table she’d seen in the Harewoods’ library. It was four hundred years younger, but it was the same table. And sitting on a chair, trying to look innocent, was Lady Arabella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will have your—” Nicholas began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dougless cut him off when she flung open a little door to the left of the window. There, huddled against the shelves, were two servants. “This is why I wanted you to open the door,” she said to Nicholas. “These two spies would have seen everything you two were about to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas and Arabella were gaping at her, speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless looked at the two servants. “If one word of this gets out, we’ll know who told. Do you understand me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of Dougless’s odd speech pattern, they did indeed understand her. “Now get out of here,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs quickly as mice, they scurried from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You—” Nicholas began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring him, Dougless turned to Arabella. “I’ve saved your life, because your husband would have heard of this and eventually he would have—” Dougless took a deep breath. “I think you’d better go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArabella, not used to being spoken to like this, started to protest, but then she thought of her husband’s temper. She hurried from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dougless turned to Nicholas, she saw the rage on his face—which was nothing new, since he’d hardly looked at her any other way since she’d arrived. She gave him a hard glare, then started to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t make it out the door because Nicholas slammed it in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you spy on me?” he asked. “Do you enjoy watching what I do with other women?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount to ten, Dougless thought, or better yet, twenty. She drew a deep breath. “I do not get my kicks from watching you make a fool of yourself with women,” she said calmly. “I’ve told you why I’m here. I knew you were about . . . about to have Arabella on the table because you’d already done so. The servants told everybody, John Wilfred wrote the story, Arabella had your kid, and Robert Sydney did her in. Now, may I go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the emotions running across Nicholas’s face, the anger, the confusion, and Dougless felt sympathy for him. “I know that what I’m saying is impossible to believe. When you came to me, I didn’t believe you either, but, Nicholas, I’m from the future and I’ve been sent back in time to try to prevent the ruin of your entire family. Lettice—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis look cut her off. “Do you accuse an innocent woman? Or are you jealous of all women I touch?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-knight-in-shining-armor-montgomery-taggart-15/page-37.html","bookId":1851,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:08 PM"}
