Her resolve was as solid as the Tower of London\u0027s ancient stone walls that stood twenty feet away .I could see the night getting darker - the lights grow brighter - and my best friend\u0027s confidence was almost contagious. Almost. But staring at the crowd in the distance, I couldn\u0027t help but think I am not prepared for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean don\u0027t get me wrong, I am prepared for a lot of scary situations. After all, in the last year and a half I\u0027d been fake kidnapped once, almost truly kidnapped twice, targeted by one international terrorist and two incredibly cute boys. So, scary? Yeah, scary and I go way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at that moment Rebecca Baxter and I were standing on ice skates on a rink that used to be the moat around the Tower of London. We were outnumbered and outsized. So something about that moment was . . . terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though my best friend was beside me. Even though our school had trained us well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though we go to a school for spies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh, Cam. They\u0027re looking this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me hoped Bex was talking about her father, who stood by the skating rinks concession stand, or her mother, who was by the rink\u0027s east exit. I totally wished that Bex was talking about the agents in the crowd, whose job it was to protect me - like that woman with the backpack who had been trailing us all afternoon, or the man who was posted at the top of Tower Bridge, as it transportation routes for a half mile in any direction. But I knew Rebecca Baxter well enough to know that she wasn\u0027t talking about the spies. She was talking about . . . the boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bex spun effortlessly and skated backward past the crowd of guys that stood laughing and showing off at the edge of the rink, every single one of them turned to stare at her. Her red scarf waved in the wind as she smiled. \"So which one do you want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks.\" I shrugged. \"Trying to give them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, sure they looked nice, cute, and completely harmless, but if there\u0027s one thing we Gallagher Girls know, it\u0027s that looks can totally be deceiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Cam,\" Bex pleaded. \"How about the tall one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The short one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thank you,\" I said with a shake of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one with . . .\" Bex didn\u0027t finish. Her eyes went wide and she stared past me, but my mind was thinking back to a chilly November night in Washington D.C., and a steamy summer afternoon on a rooftop in Boston, as the two scariest moments of my life flashed before my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my heart begin to pound. \"What is it?\" I scanned the crowd, trying to catch a glimpse of what Bex had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam . . .\" Bex started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun on the ice, waiting for Bex\u0027s mother, for her father, for some of my guards to register the same shock I saw in my best friend\u0027s eyes, but their faces were blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bex,\" I snapped, \"what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing. It\u0027s just . . . Tell me this Cam . . .? Her smile was pure evil, and she spoke so slowly that I sort of wanted to hurt her. \"Just tell me . . . are you sure you\u0027ve given up all boys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bex, what are you saying?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my best friend just pouted, raised her hand to her mouth, and said, \"Oops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Rebecca Baxter, the most highly coordinated girl at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women (which, believe me, includes some really coordinated girls), tumbled onto the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it turns out that pretending to fall down is an excellent way to make boys stop staring and start moving. Of, course our other roommate, Liz, would no doubt require a lot more evidence before citing that as a scientific certainty, but considering that fact that eight boys had been staring and seven boys rushed to Bex\u0027s rescue, I\u0027d say our results were pretty statistically sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, honestly, at that moment statistics were the last thing on my mind, because fluffy white snowflakes were floating through the night sky that stood between me and the one boy who didn\u0027t move, the boy who didn\u0027t swoon, the boy who just stood by the rails with his hands in his pockets, staring at me, saying, \"Happy New Year, Gallagher Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a pretty wide range of emotions that any girl - much less a Gallagher Girl - is bound to encounter on any given day - from joy to sadness, frustration to excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point it\u0027s pretty safe to say that I was feeling all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was trying to show none of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex\u0027s seven suitors kneeled beside her on the ice, while my skates pulled me closer to the one boy who lingered by the rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look cold,\" I somehow managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to have a warmer jacket, but then I gave it to some girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t very smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" he smirked and shook his head. \"It probably wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite having known him for almost a year, there were a lot of things I still didn\u0027t know about Zachary Goode. Like how soap and shampoo could smell so much better on him than anyone else. Like where he went when he wasn\u0027t showing up at random (and frequently dangerous) points in my life. And, most of all, I didn\u0027t know how when he mentioned the jacket, he made me think about the sweet, romantic part of the night last November when he\u0027s given it to me, and not the terrible, bloody, international-terrorist-are-trying-to-kidnap-me part that came right after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corner of my eye, I could see that the boys had \"helped\" Bex to a bench not far away, but Zach didn\u0027t seem to notice. He just inched closer to me and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, it looked better on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of things that that the Gallagher Academy teaches us to remember, but right then I was wishing my exceptional education had also taught me how to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, it was a chilly night in a foreign city, and an incredibly hot guy was smiling at me through the soft glow of sparkly lights! The absolute last thing I wanted to remember was the last time I\u0027d seen Zach - the screeching tires or the masked men. Seriously, forgetting would have come in so incredibly handy at that particular moment. But I\u0027m a Gallagher Girl. We don\u0027t forget anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do I get the feeling you aren\u0027t here on vacation?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Bex laughing. I sensed Zach\u0027s hand inching down the rail, closer and closer to mine. For just one second, I thought he might say me - that he was here to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Joe Solomon.\" He glanced around the Tower grounds. \"Thought maybe he was with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just that quickly the pounding of my heart took on an entirely different meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, it sounded like an easy question, but nothing about my Covert Operations instructor has even been easy. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, my mind reeling with at least a dozen reasons why Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon might follow me to London - and not one of them was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Gallagher Girl. It\u0027s probably noth-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me or I\u0027ll yell for Mr. and Mrs. Baxter, and you can find out how Bex became Bex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked the hard-packed snow gathered at the edge of the rink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were supposed to meet up a few days ago, but he didn\u0027t show.\" Zach stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he didn\u0027t call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I know when most teenagers talk about someone not calling, they\u0027re usually complaining. Or whining. But Zach isn\u0027t exactly the whining type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt cold for the first time in the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not on my protection detail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mom\u0027s off looking for leads on the Circle, right?\" Zach asked. \"Could he be with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, \"I guess so, but . . . I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he checked in with the Baxters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one ever tells me anything, remember?\" I searched his face, and despite everything, I couldn\u0027t help but savor the face that there was finally something Zach didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being out of the loop isn\u0027t fun, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rebecca!\" Bex\u0027s mother\u0027s voice echoed through the cold air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to go,\" Zach said with a nod in the Baxter\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Mr. Solomon is missing call-ins, then we have to look for him. We\u0027ve got to tell Bex\u0027s Parents . . . we\u0027ve got to call my mom so she can -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Zach snapped, then shook his head and forced a smile. \"It\u0027s probably nothing, Gallagher Girl. Go on. Have fun,\" he said, as if that were possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cameron,\" Bex\u0027s father called. \"Say good-bye to the young man now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to tell them, Zach. It Mr. Solomon is missing . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d know,\" Zach reminded me. His voice softened. \"Whatever is going on, I promise you they know a whole lot more than me do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach eased away from the rail while, behind us, Mr. Baxter\u0027s voice grew louder. \"Let\u0027s go, Cammie!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over my shoulder at my best friend\u0027s father, her mother, and the guards that had surrounded me for weeks. \"I\u0027ll be right there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned back to the rail, Zach was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex\u0027s dad is one of England\u0027s top spies (not to mention the man who taught his daughter how to use a Barbie as a weapon when she was seven), so I didn\u0027t run after Zach. I didn\u0027t yell. I just kept pace beside Abe Baxter, skating slowly across the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tower of London is the oldest royal building still in official use today, Cammie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows, Dad,\" Bex said, even though A) I actually didn\u0027t know, and B) at that point, I had far more covert facts on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Baxter -\" I started to say, but Bex\u0027s father was already pointing at the Tower\u0027s tall stone walls and saying, \"The Jewel House alone is a Grade AA target -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows, Dad,\" Bex said again, rolling her eyes. But she didn\u0027t really seem annoyed when she stared up at her father listening for him to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has reinforced titanium security gates and a nine-hundred-and-eighty-point self-modifying laser grid.\" Then he stopped. \"I\u0027m sorry, Cammie, you were saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something in the way he looked at me made me forget about Zach and Mr. Solomon and even the Circle of Caven. Something reminded me that dads tell corny jokes. Dads drone on and on about history facts that don\u0027t really matter to ninety-nine percent of the world\u0027s population. Dads sometimes look at daughters like they\u0027re more precious than all the diamonds in England. I remembered that - once upon a time - someone had looked like that at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . I just wanted to thank you again for letting me spend winter break with you,\" I managed to mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed my shoulder. \"It\u0027s our pleasure, Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, I told myself that Zach was right - it was probably nothing. Everything was probably fine. After all, Mr. Solomon was careful. Mr. Solomon was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh . . . ravens!\" Mr. Baxter said, easing onto the bench beside me. He pointed to a blackbird that was scavenging for crumbs near the base of the tall stone wall. \"Now, there\u0027s an interesting piece of history, Cammie. According to legend, England will fall if the ravens ever leave the Tower of London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, as I glided to one of the benches and started loosening the laces on my skates, my fingers didn\u0027t want to work. It was like I\u0027d forgotten how to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the bird but didn\u0027t say anything. It was so black against the white ice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-1.html","bookId":2749,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM"}
