She skirted the edge of a massive cliff that overlooked a huge, black ocean. A flock of seabirds pursued her, their wild screams beating at her ears like Dr. Cable\u0027s razor-edged voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the stony cliffs beneath her cracked and fissured. A huge rift opened up, the ocean rushing in with a roar that drowned the seabirds\u0027 cries. She found herself tumbling through the air, falling down toward the black water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean swallowed her, filling her lungs, freezing her heart so that she couldn\u0027t cry out....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Tally shouted, sitting bolt upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold wind off the sea struck her face, clearing her head. Tally looked around, realizing that she was up on the cliffs, tangled in her sleeping bag. Tired, hungry, and desperate to pee, but not falling into oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. The seabirds still cried around her, but in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last dream had been only one of many falling nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight was coming, the sun setting over the ocean, turning the water bloodred. Tally pulled her shirt and jacket on before daring to emerge from the sleeping bag. The temperature seemed to be dropping by the minute, the light fading before her eyes. She hurried to get ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hoverboard was the tricky part. Its unfolded surface had gotten wet, covered with a fine layer of ocean spray and dew. Tally tried to wipe it off with her jacket sleeve, but there was too much water and not enough jacket. The wet board folded up easily enough, but it felt too heavy when she was done, as if the water was still trapped between the layers. The board\u0027s operation light turned yellow, and Tally looked closely. The sides of the board were gradually oozing the water away. \"Fine. Gives me time to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally pulled out a packet of SpagBol, then realized that her purifier was empty. The only ready source of water was at the bottom of the cliff, and there was no way down. She wrung out her wet jacket, which produced a few goodsquooshes, then scraped off handfuls of the water oozing from the board until the purifier was half-full. The result was a dense, overspiced SpagBol that required lots of chewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she was done with the unhappy meal, the board\u0027s light had turned green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, ready to go,\" Tally said to herself. But where? She stood still, pondering, one foot on the board and one on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay\u0027s note read, \"At the second make the worst mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking a mistake shouldn\u0027t be that hard. But what was theworst mistake? She\u0027d almost killed herself once today already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally remembered her dream. Falling into the gorge would count as a pretty bad mistake. She stepped onto the board and edged it to the crumbling end of the bridge, looking down to where the river met the sea far below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she climbed down, her only possible path would be to follow the river upstream. Maybe that\u0027s what the clue meant. But the steep cliff showed no obvious path, not even a handhold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, a vein of iron in the cliff might carry her down safely. Her eyes scanned the walls of the gorge, searching for the reddish color of iron. A few spots looked promising, but in the growing darkness, she couldn\u0027t be certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" Tally realized that she\u0027d slept too long. Waiting for dawn would be twelve hours lost, and she didn\u0027t have any more water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other option was to hike upriver atop the cliff. But it might be days before she reached a place to climb down. And how would she see it at night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to make up time, not blunder around in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally swallowed, coming to a decision. There had to be a way down on her board. Maybe she was making a mistake, but that\u0027s what the clue called for. She edged the board off the bridge until it began to lose purchase. It slipped down the cliffside, descending faster as it left the metal of the track behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally\u0027s eye searched desperately for any sign of iron in the cliff. She eased the board forward, bringing it closer to the wall of stone, but saw nothing. A few of the board\u0027s metal-detector lights flickered out. Any lower, and she was going to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t going to work. Tally snapped her fingers. The board slowed for a second, trying to climb, but then shivered and continued to descend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally spread her jacket, but the air in the gorge was still. She spotted a rusty-looking streak in the wall of stone and coaxed the board closer, but it turned out to be just a slimy smear of lichen. The board slipped downward faster and faster, the metal-detector lights flickering out one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the board went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally realized that this mistake might be her last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell like a rock, down toward the crashing waves. Just like in the dream, her voice felt choked by a freezing hand, as if her lungs were already filled with water. The board tumbled below her, spinning like a falling leaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally closed her eyes, waiting for the shattering impact of cold water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, something grabbed her by the wrists and yanked her up cruelly, spinning her in the air. Her shoulders screamed with pain, and she spun once all the way around like a gymnast on the rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally opened her eyes and blinked. She was being lowered onto the hoverboard, which waited rock-steady just above the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the...?\" she wondered aloud. Then, as her feet came to rest, Tally realized what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe river had caught her. It had been dumping metal deposits there for centuries, or however long rivers lasted, and the board\u0027s magnets had found purchase just in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saved, more or less,\" Tally muttered. She rubbed her shoulders, which ached from being caught by the crash bracelets, and wondered how far you had to fall before the bracelets would rip your arms out of their sockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027d made it down. The river stretched out in front of her, winding its way into the snowcapped mountains. Tally shivered in the ocean breeze and pulled her soggy jacket tighter around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Four days later take the side you despise,\u0027\" she quoted Shay\u0027s note. \"Four days. Might as well get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her first sunburn, Tally stuck a sunblock patch onto her skin every morning at dawn. But even with only a few hours in the sun each day, her already brown arms gradually deepened in color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagBol never again tasted as good as it had that first time on the cliffs. Tally\u0027s meals ranged from decent to odious. The worst were SpagBol breakfasts, around sunset, when the mere thought of more noodles made her never want to eat again. She almost wished she would run out of the stuff and be forced to either catch a fish and cook it, or simply starve, losing her ugly-fat the hard way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Tally really dreaded was running out of toilet paper. Her only roll was already half-gone, and she rationed it strictly now, counting the sheets. And every day, she smelled a little worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third day up the river, she decided to take a bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally awoke, an hour before sunset as usual, feeling sticky inside the sleeping bag. She\u0027d washed her clothes that morning and left them to dry on a rock. The thought of getting into clean clothes with dirty skin made her flesh crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water in the river was fast-moving, and left almost nothing in the muck-trap of the purifier, which meant it was clean. It was icy cold, though, probably fed by melting snow in the approaching mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally prayed it would be slightly less freezing late in the day, after the sun had had a chance to warm it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe survival kit did have soap, it turned out - a few disposable packets tucked into a corner of the knapsack. Tally clenched one in her hand as she stood at the edge of the river, wearing nothing but the sensor clipped to her belly ring, shivering in the cool breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go,\" she said, trying to keep her teeth from chattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put one foot in and jumped back from the icy streak of agony that shot into her leg. Apparently, there would be no easing slowly into the water. She had to take a running jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally walked along the riverbank, searching for a good place to leap in, slowly gathering her courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she\u0027d never been naked outside before. In the city, everywhere outdoors was public, but she hadn\u0027t seen another human face for days. The world seemed to belong to her. Even in the cool air, the sun felt wonderful on her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clenched her teeth and faced the river. Standing here pondering the wild wasn\u0027t going to get her clean. Just a few steps and a leap, and gravity would do the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe counted down from five, then counted down from ten, neither of which worked. Then she realized that she was getting cold just standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Tally jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe freezing water closed like a fist around her. It paralyzed every muscle, turning her hands into shivering claws. For a moment, Tally wondered how she would make it back to shore. Maybe she would just expire here, slipping under the icy water forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep, shuddering breath, reminding herself that the people before the Rusties must have taken baths in freezing streams all the time. Tally clenched her teeth to stop them chattering, and dipped her head under the water and out, whipping wet hair onto her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later an unlikely kernel of warmth ignited in her stomach, as if the icy water had activated some secret reserve of energy within her body. Her eyes opened wide, and she found herself whooping with excitement. The mountains, towering above her after three nights\u0027 travel inland, seemed suddenly crystal clear, their snowy peaks catching the last rays of the setting sun. Tally\u0027s heart pounded fiercely, her blood spreading unexpected warmth throughout her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the burst of energy was burning quickly. She fumbled the soap packet open, squishing it between her fingers, across her skin, and into her hair. Another dunking and she was ready to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back at the shore, Tally realized that she\u0027d been carried away from her camp by the river\u0027s current. She swam a few strokes upstream, then trudged toward the rocky shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaist-high in the water, already shivering from the breeze on her wet body, Tally heard something that made her heart freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was coming. Something big. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-19.html","bookId":1573,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM"}
