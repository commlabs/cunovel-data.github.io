Someone had broken into my apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam\u0027s jaw clenched. Not a good sign, she decided. She didn\u0027t have to guess why he was out of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re just now mentioning this?\" he asked\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t care for his condescending tone. \"Yes, I\u0027m just now mentioning this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think the home invasion and your road incident might be related?\" Phillips asked. Like Liam\u0027s, his voice was also strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was getting the feeling both of them wanted to yell at her. She tried to justify her actions. \"Yes, I know I\u0027m supposed to call you, Agent Phillips, if there are ever any problems, but nothing was taken from my apartment, and there was already a policeman taking a report, so I didn\u0027t think it was necessary to bother you. I\u0027m pretty certain I know who it was. My aunt and uncle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer new announcement led to another round of questions, and by the time Liam finished with her, she felt like an imbecile. Just because Stamos guessed her aunt and uncle were responsible didn\u0027t make it so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam rubbed his brow as if trying to wipe away a headache. \"So you\u0027ve figured it was your aunt and uncle at your apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling backed into a corner, she said, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, then asked, \"What reason do you have for being run off the road?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking it was probably road rage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Road rage.\" Phillips repeated her words and dropped into his chair. \"What could you have done to make the driver come after you like that?\" Frowning, he asked, \"Were you texting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he blaming her? \"Of course I was texting,\" she countered. \"I always text while I drive. Oh, and I was putting on lipstick and mascara, so I had to adjust the mirror. . . .\" She couldn\u0027t think of anything else outrageous to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillips didn\u0027t look amused. \"This is a serious matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve taken care of the police report on your car,\" he said then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t road rage,\" Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him for several seconds, letting the events of the last few hours sink in. \"They\u0027re related, aren\u0027t they? But how? Do you have any theories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Several, as a matter of fact,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll find who did this,\" he added with a granite voice. \"And when we do . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfraid he would say something crazy in front of Phillips, she stood and said, \"We\u0027re finished, right? Do you want me to work or go home? I should go home.\" And before Phillips could answer, she said, \"I\u0027m going home. I need to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beginning to feel a delayed reaction to the effects of her near miss. Her hands were still shaking so much she knew she wouldn\u0027t be able to type, and she felt weak. Liam saw how pale she\u0027d become and grabbed her before she could fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was walking out the door with Liam holding her arm when she turned back. \"Where\u0027s my laptop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The techs have it,\" Phillips said. \"It was pretty banged up. They\u0027ll see what they can salvage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first she noticed that Liam had her backpack and phone was when he opened her apartment door for her. He must have gotten them out of the car, she thought, or maybe she\u0027d held them when he pulled her through the window. She was too tired to figure it out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam led her to her bed and pulled the covers back. Within seconds of laying her head on the pillow, she was sound asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her eyes again, she looked at her alarm clock and saw that several hours had passed. She could hear Liam\u0027s voice in the living room. He was on the phone. He was always on his phone, it seemed. His job didn\u0027t let up. She couldn\u0027t tell whom he was talking to, but she caught snippets of his conversation. She heard part of a question about an underground cell and another about an informer. He kept his voice low and she couldn\u0027t make out anything else. The minute he ended one call, another came in. She honestly didn\u0027t know how he could keep up with it all. She knew he was in a high-pressure job, one that was very important, but she also knew it was impossible for one person to handle so many responsibilities. Even Liam. He sounded tired. No matter how much stamina he had, he would eventually crash. Allison got scared thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got out of bed and stood in the doorway until he noticed her. \"Liam, when did you get back from Berlin?\" she asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-99.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
