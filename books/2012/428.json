Sorry about that – I ain’t no spinner of decent tales, Hedge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ll say. What else should I know? We got to kiss that fucking heart awake once we get it? Put a hat on it? Dance in fucking circles round it? Gods, not more blood sacrifice – that stuff creeps me out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re babbling, Hedge. It’s what you always do before a fight – why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To distract you, of course. You keep chewing on yourself there’ll be nothing left but wet gristle and a few pubic hairs I really don’t want to see. Oh, and the teeth that did all the chewing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You know,’ Fiddler said with a sidelong glance, ‘if you wasn’t here, Hedge, I’d have to invent you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just saying thanks, that’s all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fine. Now can I babble some more? ’Cause I’m terrified, y’see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This will work, Hedge. Get your kitten throwers spread out through my squads, and we’ll make a mess of whoever tries to take us down.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Exactly. Good idea. Shoulda thought of it myself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man moved off again, and Fiddler’s gaze tracked him until he reached his original position at the head of the Bridgeburners. Bless ya, Hedge . He swung round to face his troops. ‘That’s the place, soldiers. That hill. Let’s quick-time it now – only a bell or two before dusk and I want us digging and piling stones in a solid perimeter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Captain,’ barked out a heavy. ‘Could do with some fucking exercise.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother soldier answered. ‘Knew I should never have carried you, woman!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you’d been carrying me, Reliko, I’d be pregnant by now – any chance y’get, right, you rat-eating piece of elephant dung.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Maybe if I closed my eyes. But then, can a man even breed with a warthog?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If anybody’d know the answer to that—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Save your breaths, damn you,’ growled Fiddler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey trudged over the lesser rises, tackled the hillside. Bottle moved up past Corabb and made the climb alongside Sergeant Tarr. ‘Listen, Sergeant …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now what, Bottle? Pull out your shovel – we got work to do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldiers were throwing down their kits on all sides, muttering and complaining about sore backs and aching shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s this ground,’ Bottle said, drawing close. ‘I need to talk to the captain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarr scowled at him, and then nodded. ‘Go on, but don’t take too long. I don’t want you dying ’cause you dug your hole too shallow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle stared at the man, and then looked round. ‘They that close?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How should I know? Care to risk your life that they aren’t?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing under his breath, Bottle set out to where he’d last seen Fiddler – up near the crest of the hill. Hedge had gone up there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a narrow, twisted route between outcrops of bedrock, he heard boots behind him and turned. ‘Deadsmell. You following me for a reason or is it my cute backside?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your cute backside, but I need to talk to Fid, too. Two joys in one, what can I say?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This hill—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Barrow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right, fine. Barrow. There’s something—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sunk deep all the way round it, aye. Widdershins damn near shit himself the moment he hit the slope.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle shrugged. ‘Us other squaddies call him Widdershits, on account of his loose bowels. What about it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Really? Widdershits? That’s great. Wait till Throatslitter hears that one. But listen, how come you’re keeping secrets from us like that? Names like that? We wouldn’t do it to you, you know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stifflips and Crack? Scuttle and Corncob? Turd and Brittle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, you heard them, huh?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the crest, stepped out on to level ground. Ahead, standing near a long sword thrust into the ground, Fiddler and Hedge. Both men turned as the soldiers approached, hearing the stones snapping underfoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Forgot how to dig holes, you two?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Captain. It’s just that we got us company.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Explain that, Bottle. And be succinct for a change.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There’s a god here with us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge seemed to choke on something and turned away, coughing, hacking and then spitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You idiot,’ said Fiddler. ‘That’s the whole fucking point.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-428.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
