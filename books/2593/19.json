Bateman wants that,\" he says, rubbing his hands eagerly together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up Montgomery\u0027s card and actually finger it, for the sensation the card gives off to the pads of my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice, huh?\" Price\u0027s tone suggests he realizes I\u0027m jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say offhandedly, giving Price the card like I don\u0027t give a shit, but I\u0027m finding it hard to swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red snapper pizza,\" McDermott reminds me. \"I\u0027m f**king starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No pizza,\" I murmur, relieved when Montgomery\u0027s card is placed away, out of sight, back in Timothy\u0027s pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" McDermott says, whining. \"Let\u0027s order the red upper pizza.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Craig,\" Van Patten says, eyeing a waitress taking a booth\u0027s order. \"But call that hardbody over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s not ours,\" McDermott says, fidgeting with the menu he\u0027s yanked from a passing busboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call her over any way,\" Van Patten insists. \"Ask her for water or a Corona or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why her?\" I\u0027m asking no one in particular. My card lies on the table, ignored next to an orchid in a blue glass vase.

A pizza should be yeasty and slightly bready and have a cheesy crust! The crusts here are too f**king thin because the shithead chef who cooks here overbakes everything! The pizza is dried out and brittle!\" Red-faced, I slam my Bellini down on the table and when I look up our appetizers have arrived. A hardbody waitress stands looking down at me with this strange, glazed expression. I wipe a hand over my face, genially smiling up at her. She stands there looking at me as if I were some kind of monster - she actually looks scared\u0026nbsp; - and I glance over at Price - for what? guidance? - and he mouths \"Cigars\" and pats his coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcDermott quietly says, \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re brittle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" I say, ignoring McDermott, taking an arm and pulling her toward me.

Now\" - with the other hand I pull out my gazelleskin wallet - \"we would like to enjoy some fine Cuban cigars afterwards and we don\u0027t want to be bothered by some lout ish - \" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-19.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
