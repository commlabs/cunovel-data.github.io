It was probably riding the stiff wind that seemed to rush over Dartmoor constantly, tilting small trees into lopsidedness. Just when she thought they might actually catch it, the horses screamed in terror and the carriage jerked to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door burst open. A young man stood before them. He was a tall, swarthy fellow of the type that Petunia would swoon over; rakishly handsome in a floppy way. He was wearing a black silk top hat and a greatcoat that covered him from neck to ankle. Papa would call him a “young blunt” in a disgusted tone of voice. Sophronia was briefly afraid that this was some new form of flywayman—except that he wore no goggles and was grinning at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ladies!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique colored becomingly. “Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Winds are fierce this evening. Can’t float down for a pickup. You ladies will have to wait until after sunset, then I’ll give you a lift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Monique’s delicate little nose wrinkled. “Must we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man’s cheerful expression didn’t falter under the weight of her dissatisfaction. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, very well.” Monique gave the man her hand and he helped her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not turn to accompany her, instead looking inquiringly at Dimity and Sophronia. “Ladies. No time like the present.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity gathered up her little basket, also blushing furiously, and put her hand into the man’s large one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped her down and returned for Sophronia. “Miss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia busily checked the cab for any forgotten items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man observed this with a twinkle in his dark eyes. “Cautious girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia didn’t dignify this with a reply. She hadn’t pinpointed the particulars yet, but there was something odd about this man, aside from his being adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the wind was biting, and the great airship was even more impressive. The horses were restless, rolling their eyes and straining against their traces. The coachman fought to hold them. There seemed to be no reason for their panic. The young man strode forward to pay the driver. This only terrified the animals further. The coachman managed to take possession of his fare and keep hold of the reins, but only by dint of real skill. Then he turned his steeds around and let them have their way, careening across the heath at a breakneck speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity sidled up to Sophronia and whispered, “Isn’t he simply scrumptious?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia pretended obtuseness. “The coachman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, silly. Him!” Dimity tilted her head toward their new escort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a little old, don’t you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity considered the age of the young man. He was, perhaps, one-and-twenty. “Well, I suppose. But Monique doesn’t believe so. Look at her flirting! Shameless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man and Monique were discussing the lack of luggage. With animated hand gestures, Monique described its loss, their recent attack, and their subsequent escape. She downplayed Sophronia’s part and accentuated her own. Sophronia would have defended herself, but there was something about the way Monique told the story that was about more than ego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s hiding something. Has been all along—and not only her real identity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A brain?” Dimity suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he isn’t wearing any shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I say! You’re right. How peculiar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the horses were afraid of him. Every time he got close, they shied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps they have equine standards—an abhorrence of bare feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man, apparently tired of Monique’s tales, came to join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older girl trailed behind him and finally remembered her manners. “Girls, this is Captain Niall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity bobbed a curtsy. “Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia followed suit a second later with a much less tidy curtsy and a much less pleasant “Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique said, “Miss Dimity Plumleigh-Teignmott, full credentials, and Miss Sophronia Angelina Temminnick, covert recruit.” Her lip curled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man touched the brim of his top hat and bowed to each in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Niall had a nice smile, and Sophronia liked his boneless way of moving. But she had a sinking suspicion he wasn’t wearing a cravat under the greatcoat. Also, it looked as if his top hat was tied under his chin like a baby’s bonnet. Since she figured it might be rude to point out the man’s deficiencies in attire to his face, she said instead, “I do hope the coachman finds his way back to civilization safely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Commendable conscientiousness, Miss Temminnick, but I shouldn’t trouble yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, the sun had completely set. The airship, drifting away, began to fade into the misty, purpled sky, becoming increasingly difficult to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back in a jiff.” The young captain ambled down a little gulley, disappearing behind a large rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ladies could still see his top hat bobbing, but nothing else, and that only for a moment. The hat began to melt down and out of sight. Was he crouching? It was difficult to hear anything above the wind, and Sophronia’s ears were already starting to ache from exposure, but she thought she could detect a moan of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, out from behind the rock, trotting up the gulley, came a massive wolf. A rangy beast with dark, mottled, black-and-brown fur and a fluffy, white-tipped tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity let out of a squeak of alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia froze, but only for a moment. Werewolf! said her brain, putting everything together in one split second. The lack of shoes. The full greatcoat. Now he was coming at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and ran straight for the nearest coppice of trees, thinking only in terms of safety. She ignored Monique’s instructions for her to stop. She didn’t even think of poor Dimity. Her only instinct was that of prey: to scurry and hide, to escape the predator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf leapt after her far faster than any normal wolf ever could. Not that Sophronia had ever met such a monster before. She had heard the rumors about supernatural speed and strength, but she had hardly given them credence. This werewolf proved all the fairy tales true. Before she had gone more than a few paces, he caught up to her and jumped over her head, twisting in midair and coming to rest facing her and blocking her path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia crashed right into him and fell to her back on the rough grass, winded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could rise, a massive paw descended onto her chest, and a vicious wolf face appeared above her—black nose damp and teeth bared. The face descended and… nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia screwed her eyes shut and turned her head away, waiting for the deathblow to come from his other massive paw, or for those glistening canines to close about her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I’m not dead. She cautiously opened her eyes to look up into the wolf’s yellow ones. They crinkled at her, and the beast lolled out his tongue, grinning. His massive, sweeping tail brushed back and forth behind him. She noticed then, much to her shock, that the top hat was still tied securely to his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis incongruity served to calm her as nothing else could have. Later, Sophronia was to wonder if this was the reason Captain Niall always wore a top hat, even when he changed—to put people at ease. Or if he believed that, whatever the form, a gentleman should never be without his hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made to sit up. When he refused to let her, she said, “I won’t run again. I’m sorry. You startled me. I’ve never met a werewolf before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a small nod, he backed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity offered Sophronia a helping hand up. “Sophronia’s parents are conservatives,” she explained to the creature. She moved cautiously, suggesting that she, too, was unfamiliar with werewolves, for all her progressive upbringing. Or perhaps that is the way one is supposed to behave around them. Sophronia decided to take her cues from her new friend, and stood very slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique minced over. “If you are quite done making a fool of yourself, Covert?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia snapped back, “I wouldn’t want to make a promise I couldn’t keep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I suppose you wouldn’t. I’d better go first, Captain. Show them how it’s done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf nodded his furry, top-hatted head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Monique de Pelouse did the most remarkable thing. She sat down sidesaddle on top of the werewolf’s back, as though he were a Shetland pony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One holds on, like so,” she explained officiously, burying her hands in the wolf’s thick neck ruff. “Then one leans forward as much as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia thought she heard the girl’s stays creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf trotted off, gaining speed until he was nothing but a blur racing across the heath toward the floating school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia squinted, trying to follow his movements. He leapt impossibly high into the air, toward the ship. He was a supernatural creature, and clearly very powerful, but even werewolves couldn’t fly. It became clear, however, that he didn’t intend to, for he appeared to have landed midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must be some kind of platform,” said Dimity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia nodded. “Suspended on long cords, perhaps?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique dismounted, and Captain Niall jumped down and came racing back to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked expectantly at Dimity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity glanced at Sophronia and said, “Oh, dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia smiled. “If you’re afraid of falling, you could ride astride. It’s much easier to hang on to a horse that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity looked affronted at the very idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was only a suggestion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re very calm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia shrugged. “I’m overburdened by strange occurrences at the moment. I’ll go next, if you like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity looked relieved and gestured expansively with one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia climbed onto the werewolf. Her mother would have had hysterics—leaving aside the whole werewolf steed aspect—at the very idea that a daughter of hers would ride astride! Sophronia merely wrapped both her arms and legs about the wolf. “I’m ready.” His fur smelled of hay, sandalwood, and pork sausages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started slowly, accustoming her to his gait—which was not at all like that of a horse!—then picked up speed. Sophronia hunkered down, watching the grass and rocks rush by beneath them. They neared the airship, and with a tremendous bunching of haunches and a surge of power, Captain Niall leapt into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a brief, glorious moment, Sophronia felt as close to flying as she ever would. The wind lifted her hair and dress, the emptiness of space surrounded her, the ground was far below. Then the werewolf touched down lightly onto a small platform beside a bored-looking Monique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia climbed off. “Thank you, sir, most enjoyable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Niall jumped back down to collect Dimity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monique was ignoring her, Sophronia examined the workings of the platform. It was made of thick glass, hollowed on the inside like a box, and hung on four chains. These were looped about pulleys at each corner, which meant the whole thing could be raised and lowered as one unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe craned her neck, but saw neither hole nor docking structure in the underside of the airship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distant shrieking, getting louder and louder, heralded Dimity’s arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they landed, Dimity stopped screaming—embarrassed—and dismounted. Then she sat down on the platform abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia hurried to her friend’s side. “Are you unwell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My nerves are a little shaky, I must confess. No, please, leave me until I recover the use of my knees. That was a tad overwhelming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought it was quite a wheeze.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m beginning to understand that about you. I’m not convinced it is a good personality trait, but it certainly appears to be useful.” Dimity pushed her hair out of her face with a trembling hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Niall deposited Dimity’s basket, which he had carried in his mouth, next to her and barked imperiously. He then tilted forward over one foreleg in a lupine bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia and Monique curtsied politely, and Dimity nodded from her seated position. Then he was away, jumping down to the moor below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t he joining us?” Sophronia was confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, he doesn’t live at the school. He’s a werewolf. They don’t float. Didn’t you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia, who did not know, felt unjustly chastised. And also strangely bereft. Now that she knew what Captain Niall had been hiding with his bare feet and oddities of dress, she rather liked the man. He might have made for an ally of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she had Dimity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in reply to this thought, Dimity grinned at her. “I’m glad you’re with me. I was so nervous about coming in alone. Everyone will know one another already.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/etiquette-espionage-finishing-school-1/page-6.html","bookId":1612,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:28 PM"}
