When do we reach the point where we say two shovels aren\u0027t cutting it and go hire some help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stopped and stared at the wall of hard-packed earth before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one Eddie would ask before either Jack or Weezy. Eddie had never seen the altered sigil. He\u0027d only heard talk about it, so it wasn\u0027t as real to him as to them. Jack could picture it right about here, leaning against the right-hand wall. But even if it hadn\u0027t washed away, it might have fallen to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie would also ask because he still looked shaken by last night\u0027s events. Jack wasn\u0027t untouched - he realized the danger they\u0027d been in - and he was sure Weezy wasn\u0027t either, but they\u0027d learned to expect the unexpected and inexplicable. Eddie was still a long way from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though sunrise had brought everything back to normal, just as Weezy had predicted, Jack could tell Eddie wanted out of here. Because even though the hallway and beyond had been restored at first light, the two chairs they\u0027d tossed through the door were nowhere in sight. They\u0027d gone Somewhere Else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack wondered if that might be the same Somewhere Else his brother Tom had been taken. In truth, he didn\u0027t even know if his brother was alive. But if he was, and in the same Somewhere Else, at least now he had someplace to park his doughy butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter what they found down here today, if they needed to stay over another night, they\u0027d do it at the Lonely Pine Motel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack?\" Eddie said. \"The end point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He yanked himself back to the here and now. \"Oh, sorry.\" He shook his head. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, pick something. I need a target.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m goal directed. It\u0027s the way my mind works. It needs an end point. Give me one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack thought a moment, then shrugged. \"Two more feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t sound like much, but with a passage ten feet wide and eight feet high, that was 160 cubic feet of dirt. Eddie\u0027s daunted look said he realized that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we call Tommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we know his number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack smiled. Eddie was already preparing for defeat. Jack wasn\u0027t ready to concede yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was on the side of his truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squinted at Jack. \"You remember it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027ll bet your sister does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister does what?\" Weezy said from behind them as she descended the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember Tommy the excavator\u0027s phone number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" She rattled it off as she slipped on her work gloves. \"You giving up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After two more feet,\" Eddie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy took the shovel from her brother and gave Jack a semi-stern look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is we gonna stand here jawboning or is we gonna move some dirt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jack could answer, she drove her shovel into the wall of dirt -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd hit something that went clink!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"Do that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did, with the same result. Jack attacked the dirt in the area and within minutes a four-inch-wide expanse of gleaming black appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That look familiar?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it ever.\" Weezy\u0027s smile was beatific as she turned to Eddie. \"See? Same material as our little pyramid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027ve found it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had a lot of digging left to do to free it from the earth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-79.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
