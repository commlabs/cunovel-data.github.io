{"id":42328,"no":6,"title":"THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN","content":"In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: \u0027Dear friends, from whence do you come here?\u0027 The coal replied: \u0027I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,â€”I should have been burnt to ashes.\u0027 The bean said: \u0027I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.\u0027 \u0027And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?\u0027 said the straw. \u0027The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027But what are we to do now?\u0027 said the coal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027I think,\u0027 answered the bean, \u0027that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: \u0027I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.\u0027 The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45313.html","bookId":659,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:57:37 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:57:37 AM"}
