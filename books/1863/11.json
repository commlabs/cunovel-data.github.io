{"id":82092,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eHey, Morgead!\" the voice was shouting even as the door went slamming and crashing open, sticking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevery few inches because it was old and warped and didn\u0027t fit the frame anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez had jerked around at the first noise. The connection between her and Morgead was disrupted,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealthough she could feel faint echoes of the silver thread, like a guitar string vibrating after it was strummed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Morgead-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you still asleep-?\" Several laughing, raucous people were crowding into the room. But the yelling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopped abruptly as they caught sight of Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gasp, and then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stood up to face them. She couldn\u0027t afford to feel tired anymore; every muscle was lightly tensed,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevery sense alert\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew the danger she was in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Morgead, they were the flotsam and jetsam of the San Francisco streets. The orphans, the ones\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho lived with indifferent relatives, the ones nobody in the Night World really wanted. The forgotten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were out of school and ready to rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez had always thought, from the day she and Morgead began picking these kids up, that the Night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorld was making a mistake in treating them like garbage. They might be young; they might not have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efamilies, but they had power. Every one of them had the strength to be a formidable opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now they were looking at her like a group of wolves looking at dinner. If they all decided to go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor her at once, she would be in trouble. Somebody would end up getting killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faced them squarely, outwardly calm, as a quiet voice finally broke the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really you, Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then another voice, from beside Jez. \"Yeah, she came back,\" Morgead said carelessly. \"She joined\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe gang again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shot him the briefest of sideways glances. She hadn\u0027t expected him to help. He returned the look\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith an unreadable expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . she came back?\" somebody said blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt a twinge of amused sympathy. \"That\u0027s right,\" she said, keeping her face grave. \"I had to go away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor a while, and I can\u0027t tell you where, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow I\u0027m back. I just fought my way back in-and I beat Morgead for the leadership.\" She figured she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emight as well get it all over with at once. She had no idea how they were going to react to the idea of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another long moment of silence, and then a whoop. A sound that resembled a war cry. At the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esame instant there was a violent rush toward Jez-four people all throwing themselves at her. For a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheartbeat she stood frozen, ready to fend off a four-fold attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen arms wrapped around her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez! I missed you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone slapped her on the back almost hard enough to knock her down. \"You bad girl! You beat him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were trying to hug her and punch her and pat her all at once. Jez had to struggle not to show she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas overwhelmed. She hadn\u0027t expected this of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you guys again,\" she said. Her voice was very slightly unsteady. And it was the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven Mandril said, \"You scared us when you disappeared, you know.\" Raven was the tall, willowy one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith the marble-pale skin. Her black hair was short in back and long in front, falling over one eye and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eobscuring it. The other eye, midnight blue, gleamed at Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez allowed herself to gleam back, just a bit. She had always liked Raven, who was the most mature of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe group. \"Sorry, girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t scared.\" That was Thistle, still hugging Jez\u0027s waist. Thistle Galena was the delicate one who had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopped her aging when she reached ten. She was as old as the others, but tiny and almost weightless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had feathery blond hair, amethyst eyes, and little glistening white teeth. Her specialty was playing the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elost child and then attacking any humans who tried to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re never scared,\" Jez told her, squeezing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She means she knew you were all right, wherever you were. I did, too,\" Pierce Holt said. Pierce was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe slender, cold boy, the one with the aristocratic face and the artist\u0027s hands. He had dark blond hair and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeep-set eyes and he seemed to carry his own windchill factor with him. But just now he was looking at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez with cool approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad somebody thought so,\" Jez said, with a glance at Morgead, who just looked condescending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, some people were going crazy. They thought you were dead,\" Valerian Stillman put in,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efollowing Jez\u0027s look. Val was the big, heroic one, with deep russet hair, gray-flecked eyes, and the build\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a linebacker. He was usually either laughing or yelling with impatience. \"Morgead had us scouring the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estreets for you from Daly City to the Golden Gate Bridge-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I was hoping a few of you would fall off,\" Morgead said without emotion. \"But I had no such\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eluck. Now shut up, Val. We don\u0027t have time for all this class-reunion stuff. We\u0027ve got something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimportant to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThistle\u0027s face lit up as she stepped back from Jez. \"You mean a hunt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means the Wild Power,\" Raven said. Her one visible eye was fixed on Jez. \"He\u0027s told you already,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehasn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t need to tell her,\" Morgead said. \"She already knew. She came back because Hunter Red-fern\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewants to make a deal with us. The Wild Power for a place with him after the millennium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a reaction-the one Jez knew he expected. Thistle squeaked with pleasure, Raven laughed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuskily, Pierce gave one of his cold smiles, and Val roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows we\u0027ve got the real thing! He doesn\u0027t wanna mess with us!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Val; I\u0027m sure he\u0027s quaking in his boots,\" Morgead said. He glanced at Jez and rolled his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez couldn\u0027t help but grin. This really was like old times: she and Morgead trading secret looks about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVal. There was a strange warmth sweeping through her-not the scary tingling heat she\u0027d experienced with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead alone, but something simpler. A feeling of being with people who liked her and knew her. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeeling of belonging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never felt that at her human school. She\u0027d seen things that would drive her human classmates insane\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven to imagine. None of them had any idea of what the real world was like-or what Jez was like, for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now she was surrounded by people who understood her. And it felt so good that it was alarming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t expected this, that she would slip back into the gang like a hand in a glove. Or that something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einside her would look around and sigh and say, \"We\u0027re home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I am not home, she told herself sternly. These are not my people. They don\u0027t really know me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeither....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they don\u0027t have to, the little sigh returned. You don\u0027t ever need to tell them you\u0027re human. There\u0027s no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereason for them to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shoved the thought away, scrunched down hard on the sighing part of her mind. And hoped it would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estay scrunched. She tried to focus on what the others were saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThistle was talking to Morgead, showing all her small teeth as she smiled. \"So if you\u0027ve got the terms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esettled, does that mean we get to do it now? We get to pick the little girl up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today? Yeah, I guess we could.\" Morgead looked at Jez. \"We know her name and everything. It\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona Skelton, and she\u0027s living just a couple buildings down from where the fire was. Thistle made friends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith her earlier this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was startled, although she kept her expression relaxed. She hadn\u0027t expected things to move this fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it might all work out for the best, she realized, her mind turning over possibilities quickly. If she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esnatch the kid and take her back to Hugh, this whole masquerade could be over by tomorrow. She might\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven live through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get too excited,\" she warned Thistle, combing some bits of grass out of the smaller girl\u0027s silk-floss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair. \"Hunter wants the Wild Power alive and unharmed. He\u0027s got plans for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus, before we take her, we\u0027ve got to test her,\" Morgead said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez controlled an urge to swallow, went on combing Thistle\u0027s hair with her fingers. \"What do you mean,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etest her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTd think that would be obvious. We can\u0027t take the chance of sending Hunter a dud. We have to make\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esure she is the Wild Power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez raised an eyebrow. \"I thought you were sure,\" she said, but of course she knew Morgead was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe herself would have insisted Hugh find a way to test the little girl before doing anything else with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was that Morgead\u0027s testing was likely to be ... unpleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure, but I still want to test her!\" Morgead snapped. \"Do you have a problem with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if it\u0027s dangerous. For us, I mean. After all, she\u0027s got some kind of power beyond imagining, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she\u0027s in elementary school. I hardly think she\u0027s gonna be able to take on six vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were looking back and forth between Morgead and Jez like fans at a tennis match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just as if she never left,\" Raven said dryly, and Val bellowed laughter while Thistle giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They always sound so-married,\" Pierce observed, with just a tinge of spite to his cold voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez glared at them, aware that Morgead was doing the same. \"I wouldn\u0027t marry him if every other guy on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eearth was dead,\" she informed Pierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it were a choice between her and a human, I\u0027d pick the human,\" Morgead put in nastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone laughed at that. Even Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun glittered on the water at the Marina. On Jez\u0027s left was a wide strip of green grass, where people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere flying huge and colorful kites, complicated ones with dozens of rainbow tails. On the sidewalk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople were Rollerblading and jogging and walking dogs. Everybody was wearing summer clothing;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverybody was happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was different on the other side of the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything changed over there. A line of pinky-brown concrete stood like a wall to mark the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a high school and then rows of a housing project, all the buildings identically square, flat, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eugly. And on the next street beyond them, there was nobody walking at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez let Morgead take the lead on his motorcycle as he headed for those buildings. She always found this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplace depressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled into a narrow alley beside a store with a dilapidated sign proclaiming \"Shellfish De Lish.\" Val\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroared in after him, then Jez, then Raven with Thistle riding pillion behind her, and finally Pierce. They all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned off their motors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where she lives now; across the street,\" Morgead said. \"She and her mom are staying with her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaunt. Nobody plays in the playground; it\u0027s too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edangerous. But Thistle might be able to get her to come down the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I can,\" Thistle said calmly. She showed her pointed teeth in a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we can grab her and be gone before her mom even notices,\" Morgead said. \"We can take her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback to my place and do the test where it\u0027s private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez breathed once to calm the knot in her stomach. \"Ill grab her,\" she said. At least that way she might\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe able to whisper something comforting to the kid. \"Thistle, you try to get her right out to the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody else, stay behind me-if she sees a bunch of motorcycles, she\u0027ll probably freak. But be ready\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto gun it when I pull out and grab her. The noise should help cover up any screams. Raven, you pick up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThistle as soon as I get the kid, and we all go straight back to Morgead\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was nodding, looking pleased with the plan-except Morgead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should knock her out when we grab her. That way there won\u0027t be any screams. Not to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emention any blue fire when she figures out she\u0027s being kidnapped-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already said how we\u0027re going to do it,\" Jez cut in flatly. \"I don\u0027t want her knocked out, and I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink she\u0027ll be able to hurt us. Now, everybody get ready. Off you go, Thistle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Thistle skipped across the street, Morgead let out a sharp breath. His jaw was tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never could take advice, Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you never could take orders.\" She could see him starting to sizzle, but only out of the corner of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeye. Most of her attention was focused on the housing building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such a desolate place. No graffiti-but no grass, either. A couple of dispirited trees in front. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat playground with a blue metal slide and a few motorcycles-on-springs to ride ... all looking new and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euntouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine growing up in a place like this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce laughed oddly. \"You sound as if you feel sorry for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez glanced back. There was no sympathy in his deep-set dark eyes-and none in Raven\u0027s midnight blue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor Val\u0027s hazel ones, either. Funny, she didn\u0027t remember them being that heartless-but of course she hadn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen sensitive to the issue back in the old days. She would never have stopped to wonder about what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey felt for human children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s because it\u0027s a kid,\" Morgead said brusquely. \"It\u0027s hard on any kid growing up in a place like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez glanced at him, surprised. She saw in his emerald green eyes what she\u0027d missed in the others; a kind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof bleak pity. Then he shrugged, and the expression was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePartly to change the subject, and partly because she was curious, she said, \"Morgead? Do you know the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprophecy with the line about the blind Maiden\u0027s vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, this one?\" He quoted:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four to stand between the light and the shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour of blue fire, power in their blood. Born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision; Four less one and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarkness triumphs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. What do you think \"born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision\u0027 means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked impatient. \"Well, the Maiden has to be Aradia, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?\" Val interrupted, his linebacker body quivering with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead gave Jez one of his humoring-Val looks. \"The Maiden of the Witches,\" he said. \"You know,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe blind girl? The Maiden part of the Maiden, Mother, and Crone group that rules all the witches? She\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly one of the most important people in the Night World-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. I remember.\" Val settled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" Jez said. \"The blind Maiden has to be Aradia. But what does the \u0027year of her vision\u0027 mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow old is this kid we\u0027re snatching?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About eight, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Aradia have some special vision eight years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was staring across the street, now, his eyebrows together. \"How should I know? She\u0027s been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehaving visions since she went blind, right? Which means, like, seventeen years\u0027 worth of \u0027em. Who\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esupposed to tell which one the poem means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you mean is that you haven\u0027t even tried to figure it out,\" Jez said acidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw her an evil glance. \"You\u0027re so smart; you do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez said nothing, but she made up her mind to do just that. For some reason, the poem bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAradia was eighteen now, and had been having visions since she lost her sight at the age of one. Some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparticular vision must have been special. Otherwise, why would it be included in the prophecy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be important. And part of Jez\u0027s mind was worried about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then she saw movement across the street. A brown metal door was opening and two small figures\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne with feathery blond hair, the other with tiny dark braids. They were hand in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething twisted inside Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust stay calm, stay calm, she told herself. It\u0027s no good to think about grabbing her and making a run for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe East Bay. They\u0027ll just follow you; track you down. Stay cool and you\u0027ll be able to get the kid free\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, after Morgead does his little \"test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she stayed cool and didn\u0027t move, breathing slowly and evenly as Thistle led the other girl down the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estairs. When they reached the sidewalk, Jez pressed the starter button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t say \"Now!\" She didn\u0027t need to. She just peeled out, knowing the others would follow like a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflock of well-trained ducklings. She heard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir engines roar to life, sensed them behind her in tight formation, and she headed straight for the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wild Power kid wasn\u0027t dumb. When she saw Jez\u0027s motorcycle coming at her, she tried to run. Her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emistake was that she tried to save Thistle, too. She tried to pull the little blond girl with her, but Thistle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas suddenly strong, grabbing the chain-link fence with a small hand like steel, holding them both in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez swooped in and caught her target neatly around the waist. She swooped the child onto the saddle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efacing her, felt the small body thud against her, felt hands clutch at her automatically for balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she whipped past a parked car, twisted the throttle to get a surge of speed, and flew out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, she knew Raven was snagging Thistle and the others were all following. There wasn\u0027t a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escream or even a sound from the housing project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were roaring down Taylor Street. They were passing the high school. They were making it away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on to me or you\u0027ll fall off and get hurt!\" Jez yelled to the child in front of her, making a turn so fast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat her knee almost scraped the ground. She wanted to stay far enough ahead of the others that she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take me back home!\" The kid yelled it, but not hysterically. She hadn\u0027t shrieked even once. Jez looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd found herself staring into deep, velvety brown eyes. Solemn eyes. They looked reproachful and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunhappy-but not afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d expected crying, terror, anger. But she had the feeling that this kid wouldn\u0027t even be yelling if it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehadn\u0027t been the only way to be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should have been more worried about what she\u0027ll do to us. Maybe she can call blue fire down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto kill people. Otherwise, how can she be so composed when she\u0027s just been kidnapped?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those brown eyes-they weren\u0027t the eyes of somebody about to attack. They were-Jez didn\u0027t know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat they were. But they wrenched her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look-Iona, right? That\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Iona, I know this seems weird and scary- having somebody just grab you off the street. And I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan\u0027t explain everything now. But I promise you, you\u0027re not going to get hurt. Nothing\u0027s going to hurt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou-okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, kid, so do I, Jez thought suddenly. She had to blink hard. Tm going to take you home-or at least\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomeplace safe,\" she added, as honesty unexpectedly kicked in. There was something about the kid that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade her not want to lie. \"But first we\u0027ve got to go to a friend of mine\u0027s house. But, look, no matter how\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrange all this seems, I want you to remember something. I won\u0027t let you get hurt. Okay? Can you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelieve that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom is going to be scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez took a deep breath and headed onto the freeway. \"I promise I won\u0027t let you get hurt,\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all she could say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like a centaur, some creature that was half person and half steel horse, carrying off a human kid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat sixty miles an hour. It was pointless to try to make conversation on the freeway, and Iona didn\u0027t speak\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain until they were roaring up to Morgead\u0027s building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she said simply, \"I don\u0027t want to go in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a bad place,\" Jez said, braking front and back. \"We\u0027re going up on the roof. There\u0027s a little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egarden there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny flicker of interest showed in the solemn brown eyes. Four other bikes pulled in beside Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeeehaw! We got her!\" Val yelled, pulling off his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and we\u0027d better take her upstairs before somebody sees us,\" Raven said, tossing her dark hair so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit fell over one eye again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThistle was climbing off the back of Raven\u0027s motorcycle. Jez felt the small body in front of her stiffen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThistle looked at Iona and smiled her sharp-toothed smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona just looked back. She didn\u0027t say a word, but after a minute Thistle flushed and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now we\u0027re going to test her, right? It\u0027s time to test her, isn\u0027t it, Morgead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez had never heard Thistle\u0027s voice so shrill-so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisturbed. She glanced down at the child in front of her, but Morgead was speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s time to test her,\" he said, sounding unexpectedly tired for somebody who\u0027d just pulled off\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuch a triumph. Who\u0027d just caught a Wild Power that was going to make his career. \"Let\u0027s get it over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-11.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
