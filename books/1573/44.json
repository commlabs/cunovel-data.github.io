But standing on it, Tally could see air vents, antennae, maintenance hatchways, and of course the big circular door that the hovercars had come through, now closed. It was a wonder neither she nor David had cracked their heads hover-bouncing across it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how do we get in?\" David asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should start with this.\" She pointed toward the hovercar door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think they\u0027ll notice if we come through there and we\u0027re not a hovercar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed. But what if we jam the door? If any more Specials show up, we don\u0027t want to make it easy for them to come in after us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\" David searched through his knapsack, bringing out what looked like a tube of hair gel. He squeezed out white goo along the edges of the door, careful not to let any touch his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glue. The nano kind. You can stick your shoes to the ceiling with this stuff and hang upside down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally\u0027s eyes widened. She\u0027d heard rumors of tricks you could play with nanotech glue, but uglies weren\u0027t allowed to requisition it. \"Tell me you haven\u0027t done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I had to leave them up there. Waste of good shoes. So how do we get down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally pulled a powerjack from her pack and pointed. \"We take the elevator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big metal box sticking up from the roof looked like a storage shed, but the double doors and eye-reader gave it away. Tally squinted, making sure the reader didn\u0027t flash her, and worked her powerjack between the doors. They crumpled like foil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the doors, a dark shaft dropped away to nothingness. Tally clicked her tongue, and the echoes indicated that it was a long way down. She glanced at her collar light. Still green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally turned to David. \"Wait for me to whistle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped off into thin air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling down the shaft was much scarier than leaping off Garbo Mansion, or even flying into space from the hilltop. The darkness offered no clue how deep the shaft was, and it felt to Tally as if she might fall forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sensed the walls rushing past, and wondered if she was drifting toward one side as she fell, about to crash against it. She imagined herself bouncing from one wall to another all the way down, coming to a soft landing already broken and bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally kept her arms close to her sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she was sure the jacket would work in here. Elevators used the same magnetic lifters as any other hovercraft, so there was always a solid metal plate at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long count of five, the jacket gripped Tally. She bounced twice, straight up and down, then settled onto a hard surface and found herself in silence and absolute blackness. Stretching out her hands, she felt the four walls around her. Nothing suggested the inside of closed doors. Her fingers came away greasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally peered upward. A tiny shaft of light shone above, and she could just make out David\u0027s face peering down. She pursed her lips to whistle, but stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled sound came from below her feet. Someone talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouched, trying to grasp the words. But all Tally could hear was the razor sound of a cruel pretty\u0027s voice. The mocking tone reminded her of Dr. Cable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, the floor dropped out from under her. Tally struggled to keep her footing. When the elevator stopped again, one of her ankles twisted painfully under her weight, but she managed not to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound below her faded. One thing was certain now: The complex wasn\u0027t empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally lifted her head and whistled, then huddled in one corner of the shaft, hands covering her head, counting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive seconds later, a pair of feet dangled next to her, then jerked back up, the beam of David\u0027s flashlight swinging around drunkenly. Gradually, he settled beside her. \"Wow. It\u0027s dark down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" she hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, sweeping the flashlight around the shaft. Just above them, it fell on the inside of closed doors. Of course. Standing on the elevator\u0027s roof, they were midway between floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally interlaced her fingers, locking her hands together to give David a boost up to where he could wedge the powerjack between the doors. They crumpled open with a metal screech that set her hair on end. He pulled himself through, then extended his hand back down to her. Tally grabbed it and pulled, her grippy shoes squeaking on the walls of the elevator shaft like a herd of panicked mice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was making too much noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallway was dark. Tally tried to convince herself that no one had heard them yet. Maybe this whole floor was empty at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled out her own flashlight, pointing it at the doors as they walked down the hall. Small brown labels marked each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Radiology. Neurology. Magnetic Imaging,\" she read softly. \"Operating Theater Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at David. He shrugged and gave the door a push. It opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess when you\u0027re in an underground bunker, there\u0027s no point in locking up,\" he said softly. \"After you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally crept inside. The room was big, the walls lined with dark and silent machines. An operating tank stood in the middle, the liquid drained out of it, tubes and electrodes hanging loosely in a puddle at the bottom. A metal table glistened with the cruel shapes of knives and vibrasaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This looks like photos Mom showed me,\" David said. \"They do the operation here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally nodded. Doctors only put you in a tank if they were doing major surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe this is where they make Specials special,\" she said. The thought didn\u0027t cheer her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey returned to the hall. A few doors later, they found a room labeledMORGUE .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you...,\" she started to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shook his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey searched the rest of the floor. Basically, it was a small, well-equipped hospital. There were no torture chambers or prison cells. And no Smokies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Tally said. \"If you were the evil Dr. Cable, where would you put your prisoners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The evil who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. That\u0027s her name, the woman who runs this place. I remember from when I got busted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid frowned, and Tally wondered if she\u0027d said too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he shrugged. \"I guess I\u0027d put them in the dungeon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Down, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a set of fire stairs that led down, but they ended after only one flight. Apparently, they had reached the bottom floor of Special Circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Tally whispered. \"Before, I heard people getting out of the elevator below me. They must be somewhere down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis floor was lit by a soft glowstrip running down the middle of the hallway. A cold finger crept down Tally\u0027s spine as she read the labels on the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interrogation Room One. Interrogation Room Two. Isolation Room One,\" she whispered, her flashlight flickering across the words like an anxious firefly. \"Disorientation Room One. Oh, David, they must be down here somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, and pushed one of the doors softly, but it didn\u0027t budge. He ran his fingers around the edge, searching for a place where the powerjack could get purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let the eye-reader flash you,\" Tally warned softly. She pointed at the little camera by the door. \"If it thinks it sees an eye, it\u0027ll read your iris and check with the big computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t have any record of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that will freak it out totally. Just don\u0027t get too close. It\u0027s automatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" David said, nodding. \"These doors are too smooth, anyway. No place to fit a jack in. Let\u0027s keep looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther down the hall, a label caught Tally\u0027s eye. \"Long-Term Detention,\" she whispered. The door had a long expanse of blank wall on either side, as if the room behind it was bigger than the others. She put her ear to it, listening for any hint of sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a familiar voice. It was coming closer. \"David!\" she hissed, pulling away from the door and throwing herself against the wall. David looked around frantically for a place to hide. Both of them were in plain view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slid open, and Dr. Cable\u0027s malevolent voice poured out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re simply not trying hard enough. You just have to convince her that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Cable,\" Tally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman spun to face Tally, her hawklike features twisted in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to give myself up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tally Youngblood? How - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind, David\u0027s powerjack thudded against the side of Dr. Cable\u0027s head, and she slumped to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she...,\" David stammered. His face was white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally knelt and turned Dr. Cable\u0027s head to inspect the wound. No blood, but she was out cold. No matter how formidable cruel pretties were, surprise still had its advantages. \"She\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Cable? What\u0027s going - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally turned toward the voice, her eyes taking in the young woman before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tall and elegant, every feature perfection. Her eyes - deep and soulful, flecked with copper and gold - widened with a troubled look. Her generous lips parted wordlessly, and she raised one graceful hand. Tally\u0027s heart almost stopped at the beauty of her confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen recognition filled the woman\u0027s face, her broad smile illuminating the darkness, and Tally felt herself smiling in return. It felt good to make this woman happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tally! Itis you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Shay. She was pretty. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-44.html","bookId":1573,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM"}
