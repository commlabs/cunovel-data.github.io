Maybe we could do this again sometime?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalon gave her a sidelong glance and smiled. “All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the rest of their time together, Talon told her about all the fish he’d caught here. Using what sort of bait. At what time of day. Under what weather conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped his head to the side when his voice grew softer. His legs never stopped swinging over the edge of the pier. A few times, when he smiled, she had to look to the sea and breathe; he was so much like his uncle. She hugged him as the counter wound down to zero, promising she’d come see him again soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria fractioned into another Realm—an office. Hess sat at a sleek gray desk with a glass wall behind him. Through it she saw Reverie’s Panop—her home her entire life—with its circular levels coiling up. The view stole her breath and beckoned her forward. She’d been in the Realms dozens of times with Hess since she’d been cast out, but she hadn’t seen the Pod, her physical home, until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHess spoke before she’d taken a step. “Pleasant visit,” he said. “He’s not suffering, as you saw. I hope we can keep it that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEREGRINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePledge, Vale,” Perry said, as he held the knife to his brother’s throat. His voice sounded too harsh, like his father’s voice, and his hands shook so badly he couldn’t hold the blade steady. He had Vale pinned to the grass in an empty field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pledge to you? You can’t be serious. You have no idea what you’re doing, Perry. Admit it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what I’m doing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale started laughing. “Then why did they leave you? Why did she leave you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” Perry pressed the blade against his brother’s throat, but Vale only laughed harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it wasn’t Vale. It was Aria. Beautiful. So beautiful beneath him, on Vale’s bed. She laughed as he held the knife to her throat. Perry couldn’t take the blade away. It trembled in his hand as he pressed it against the smooth skin at her neck, and he couldn’t stop himself and she didn’t care. She just kept laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry lurched out of the nightmare and shot upright in his loft. He cursed loudly, unable to keep it quiet. Sweat rolled down his back, and he was out of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy. Easy, Perry,” Reef said. He was perched on the ladder, brow furrowed with worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was dim and deathly silent. Perry didn’t hear the usual snores of the Six. He’d woken everyone up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right?” Reef asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry turned toward the shadows, hiding his face. Two days. She’d been gone two days. He reached for his shirt and pulled it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear was waiting for him when he stepped outside. “We’re leaner than ever, Perry, I know that. But I need my people rested. It’s too much, asking them to work a whole day in the fields and then do the night watch. Some of us need sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry tensed. He slept even less lately, and everyone knew it. “We can’t afford to be raided. I need people on watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need help clearing drainage ditches, Perry. I need help tilling and seeding. What I don’t need is people snoring when they should be working.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make do with what you have, Bear. Everyone else is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will, but we won’t get more than half of what we need done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then do the half! I’m not pulling men off watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear went still, as did several people around the clearing. Perry didn’t understand how they didn’t understand. Almost a quarter of the tribe had dispersed. Of course they couldn’t get everything done. He’d hoped to build up food rations for the tribe’s journey to the Still Blue, but after the damage from the Aether storm and the loss of manpower, it was all he could do to keep them fed every day. They were overworked and underfed, and he needed a solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered his options throughout the day as he cleared drains for Bear and checked the Tides’ defense measures. Reef worked beside him, close as his shadow. When Reef wasn’t there, one of the Six took his place. They wouldn’t leave him alone. Even Cinder seemed in on it, joining Perry if he walked off in search of a few minutes to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know what they expected from him. The initial shock had worn off, and now he saw the situation for what it was. Roar and Aria had left; they would go to the Horns to find Liv and the Still Blue. Soon they’d return, and that was all. It had to be. He wouldn’t let himself think beyond that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupper was late that night—they’d lost three cooks to Wylan’s group—and the cookhouse was strangely empty and quiet. Perry didn’t taste his food, but he ate because the tribe watched him. Because he had to show them that things might have changed but tomorrow would still come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReef fell in step with him as he left the cookhouse and headed for the eastern lookout. Perry sensed Reef working up the courage to say something as they walked. Hands curling into fists, he waited to be told he needed sleep, or more patience, or both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Terrible supper,” Reef said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry let out a breath, the tension seeping out of his fingers. “Could’ve been better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReef looked up to the sky. “You feel it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry nodded. The sting in the back of his nose warned him that another storm wouldn’t be far off. “Almost always now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aether flowed, corded and angry, giving the night a blue, marbled glow. After the storm, the calm skies had only held for a day. Now there was little difference between day and night anymore. Days were darkened by clouds and the blue cast of Aether. Nights were brightened by the same. They flowed together, the edges blurring into an endless day. An ever night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Reef. “I need you to send a message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReef raised his eyebrows. “To?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marron.” Perry didn’t want to ask for help from him again—he’d done it only months ago when he’d sought refuge there with Roar and Aria—but the Tides’ position was too weak. He needed food and he needed people. He’d ask for a favor before he saw his tribe starve or lose the compound in a raid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReef agreed. “It’s a good idea. I’ll send Gren first thing tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after he and Reef showed up to relieve them, Twig and Gren remained at the watch post, huddled at the edge of a rocky overlook. The four of them sat together in comfortable silence as a fine mist began to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyde and Hayden arrived soon after, Straggler trailing behind them. They had the night off watch, all three. Perry had seen Hyde yawn half a dozen times during supper. They settled themselves along the lookout, watching as the mist thickened to rain. Still no one spoke, or left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quiet night,” Twig said finally. “We’re quiet, I mean. Not the rain.” His voice sounded raspy and hoarse after the long stretch of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You eat a frog, Twig?” Hayden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe there were frogs in the soup tonight,” said Gren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyde grunted. “Frogs taste better than that tripe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwig cleared his throat. “You know I almost did eat a live frog once,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twig, you look like a frog. You have froggy eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Show us how high you can jump, Twig.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up and let him croak the story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story itself wasn’t much. As a boy, Twig had been on the brink of kissing a frog, on a dare from his brother, when it slipped through his fingers and jumped into his mouth. It was the wrong story for Twig to tell. At twenty-three, he had yet to kiss a girl, and the Six knew it, as they knew nearly everything about one another. A massacre followed, as they took shots at Twig, saying things like maybe he was worried that after the frog, a girl would be a letdown, and that they supported his quest to find a prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry listened, smiling at the better jabs, feeling more himself than he had in the past two days. Eventually it grew quiet again, except for the rhythm of a few snores. He looked around him. The rain had stopped. Some slept. Others breathed steadily, focused on the night. No one spoke, but Perry heard them clearly. He understood why they’d been shadowing him and why they sat with him now, staying when they didn’t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven any choice, they wouldn’t leave. They’d stand by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made better pace today.” Aria wrung her hair out, scooting closer to the fire. Spring had come in force, with days of steady rain. They’d left the Tides three days ago, and her strength had finally returned. “Don’t you think we made up some ground?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar lay against his satchel, his legs crossed at the ankle, his foot tapping to a beat she couldn’t hear. “We did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good fire, too. We got lucky to find dry wood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar looked over, raising an eyebrow. She realized she’d been staring not at him, but through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what’s worse than mute Aria? Small-talking Aria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up a stick and jabbed at the fire. “I’m just sparing you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had traveled in near silence most of the day, despite Roar’s attempts at conversation. He wanted to discuss their plan for when they reached the Horns. How would they discover information about the Still Blue? How would they negotiate for Liv’s return? But Aria hadn’t wanted to discuss anything. She’d needed to stay focused on moving forward. On pushing harder when she felt the urge to turn back. And speaking might get her speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worried about Talon. She missed Perry. There was nothing she could do about either except race to the Horns. Now, feeling a little guilty over her silence, she was trying—lamely, it was true—to make up for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar frowned. “You’re sparing me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sparing you. All I’ve got right now is anxious nonsense. I’m exhausted, but I can barely sit still. And I feel like we should keep going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can travel through the night,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We need to rest. See? I’m not making any sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar watched her for a moment. Then he looked up at the tree branches above them, his expression growing thoughtful. “Have I ever told you about the first time Perry tried Luster?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said. She’d heard stories about Perry, Roar, and Liv all winter, but she’d never heard this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were on the beach, the three of us. And you know how Luster is, how it sweeps you up. Anyway, Perry got a little carried away. He decided to strip down to nothing and go for a swim. This was right in the middle of the day, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria smiled. “He did not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did. While he was out whooping in the waves, Liv took his clothes and decided it was a good time to get all the girls in the tribe to come down to the beach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria laughed. “Roar, she’s worse than you are!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m scared to see you two together. So what did Perry do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He swam down the coast, and we didn’t see him until the following morning.” Roar scratched his chin, smiling. “He told us he snuck into the compound during the night wearing seaweed.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-17.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
