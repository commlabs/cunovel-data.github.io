He must first adjust you to the trouble and cause you to learn your lesson from it. His promise is, \"I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him.\" He must be with you in the trouble first all day and all night. Then He will take you out of it. This will not come till you have stopped being restless and fretful about it and become calm and quiet. Then He will say, \"It is enough.\"(2 Sam.24:16) \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod uses trouble to teach His children precious lessons. They are intended to educate us. When their good work is done, a glorious recompense will come to us through them. There is a sweet joy and a real value in them.

One is to simply try to get rid of the trial, and be thankful when it is over. The other is to recognize the trial as a challenge from God to claim a larger blessing than we have ever had, and to hail it with delight as an opportunity of obtaining a larger measure of Divine grace. Thus even the adversary becomes an auxiliary, and the things that seem to be against us turn out to be for the furtherance of our way. Surely, this is to be more than conquerors through Him who loved us. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e--A. B.
