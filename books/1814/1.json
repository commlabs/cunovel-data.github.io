It’s exhausting. But for some womenthere is an occasional out. An excuse that lets them say what’s really on their minds, allows them to forgive even if they know they shouldn’t, and pushes them to indulge all those nasty little fantasies—without the scarlet consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can give the courage to talk dirty and the permission to go home with the bartender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the alibi. The cover story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t really you—you were possessed by Captain Morgan and the Grey Goose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I have a very high tolerance for alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucks to be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all our years together, Billy was never able to drink me under the table. Not once. Maybe it’s because I started drinking at a young age. Maybe I was just born that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, it takes a lot to get me buzzed and even more to get me drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s why, back in the day, I preferred pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch more efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep, you heard me right. Kate Brooks—pothead extraordinaire. Me and the Grateful Dead? We could’ve been bestest friends. Weed courage is what made me brave enough to get my tattoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, sadly, those days are over. As I started business school, I realized the consequences of getting caught with a controlled substance were just too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now I stick to legally sanctioned drugs only. Mostly wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew and I drink it nightly, just to unwind. And once a week we have kind of a date night—a special night. We cook together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew is a big fan of the fajitas. We drink and talk and drink some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight we drank a bit more than usual. So, even though I’m not wasted in the literal sense, my limbs feel loose. Relaxed. Just like my inhibitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave I got your attention? Excellent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen a window, ladies and gents—it’s about to get hot in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m on my back. And Drew is between my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell—his face is, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love your pu**y.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan, and he reinforces his words with actions. he’s big on actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWet, worshipful actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could f**king live down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe picks up his pace, and before you can say “Slap me with a riding crop,” I’m pulling on his hair and screaming his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, Drew smirks proudly and crawls up my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy limbs are lazy from the wine—and the orgasm, of course. All around, there’s a pleasant haze, a mist of numbness, making everything seem dreamlike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we’re kissing. And heat spreads throughout my body like an electrical current, bringing me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking me feel how real this is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rip my mouth from his and whisper—the alcohol making me brave—“Drew . . . Drew, I want to try something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gets his attention. “What do you want to try?” his tongue glides over my nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and bite my lip. “Something new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe raises his head. his lids are adorably heavy. “I like new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle and push him off me, then stand up and make my way toward the dresser—bumping into the nightstand as I go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the top drawer and pull out two pairs of handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores got them for her post-wedding bachelorette party, but she already had a pair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing one around my finger. My sexy strut back to the bed is almost ruined as I stumble on my four-inch heels, and I giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew rises up on his knees. he looks hungry, like a starving lion eyeing up a juicy steak that’s just out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe moves to take the cuffs from me, but I push him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On your back, big boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what he’s thinking. Can’t you almost hear him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm . . . Kate wants to run the show? Interesting.” he backs up and brings his wrists to the posts of the headboard. I circle his wrists and lock the half moons in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe gives each one a tug, testing it out, as I rest on my heels beside him, my eyes smoothing over the rippling naked perfection that is Drew Evans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You plan on doing something? Or are you just going to stare at me all night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him. And his eyes are eager, daring me to bring it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I can bring it. Don’t ever doubt that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my chin proudly and bring my hands between his thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing and massaging his balls slowly. I slide my hand up his already hard cock, gripping it tight—the way I know he likes— before giving it a few firm pumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew’s chest starts to rise faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before you ask, no, I wasn’t always this way. This adventurous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy entire sexual relationship with Billy involved two levels: shy and mundane. hesitant and rote. And that’s just where it stayed. It was only after Drew that I realized how much Billy and I were holding each other back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sex—in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each other’s eyes, we would always be Katie and Billy. Immature. Dependent. Forever young—like that Tuck movie about the fountain of youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Drew Evans came into my life, and the outspoken, demanding, and yes, horny woman who had been growing inside me for a decade was set free. At least in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bend at the waist, ass in the air, and take his length in with my mouth. he jerks at the contact. The alcohol must have numbed my gag reflex, because I’m able to take him all the way down my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour, five, six times. Then I bring my eyes to his. During a blow job? Guys love eye contact. Don‘t ask me why—I have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You like it when I suck your cock, Drew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe likes dirty talk too. Actually, there’s not much Drew doesn’t like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes roll back. “Fuck, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back to work, letting my tongue get into the action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis voice is breathy, panting. “God, baby—you give the best head. You could teach a frigging class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eha—that’s funny! Dick Lick 101.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter almost two years together, I’m an expert at reading Drew’s body language. So when his hips start to lift and his hands clench in the air, I know he’s close. his appreciative grunts and groans almost make me abandon my plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the last second, just before he comes, I pull away. And sit up. Drew’s eyes are squeezed shut, waiting for the explosion that’s not coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe opens his eyes and they’re bewildered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-1.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
