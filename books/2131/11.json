On several occasions he found tracks, and he followed them, but he was no ranger. Though he could survive well enough in the harsh climate, his tracking skills were nowhere near as strong as those of his drow friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor was his sense of direction. When he came over one ridge the very next day, he was surprised indeed to see that he had cut diagonally right through the corner of the great mountain range, for from this high vantage point all the southland seemed to spread wide before him. Wulfgar looked back to the mountains, thinking that his chances for finding a fight would be much better in there, but inevitably his gaze swung back to the open fields, the dark clusters of forest, and the many long and unknown roads. He felt a pull in his heart, a longing for distance and open expanses, a desire to break the bounds of his boxed-in life in Icewind Dale. Perhaps out there he might find new experiences that would allow him to dismiss all the tumult of images that whirled in his thoughts. Perhaps divorced from the everyday familiar routines he could also find distance from the horrors of his memories of the Abyss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding to himself, Wulfgar started down the steep southern expanse. He found another set of tracks-orc, most likely-a couple hours later, but this time he passed them by. He was out of the mountains as the sun disappeared below the western horizon. He stood watching the sunset. Great orange and red flames gathered in the bellies of dark clouds, filling the western sky with brilliant striped patterns. The occasional twinkling star became visible against the pale blue wherever the clouds broke apart. He held that pose as all color faded, as darkness crept across the fields and the sky, broken clouds rushing past overhead. Stars seemed to blink on and off. This was the moment of renewal, Wulfgar decided. This was the moment of his rebirth, a clean beginning for a man alone in the world, a man determined to focus on the present and not the past, determined to let the future sort itself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved away from the mountains and camped under the spreading boughs of a fir tree. Despite his determination, his nightmares found him there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the next day Wulfgar\u0027s stride was long and swift, covering the miles, following the wind or a bird\u0027s flight or the bank of a spring creek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found plenty of game and plenty of berries. Each passing day he felt as though his stride was less shackled by his past, and each night the terrible dreams seemed to grab a him a bit less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then one day he came upon a curious totem, a low pole set in the ground with its top carved to resemble the pegasus, the winged horse, and suddenly Wulfgar found himself vaulted back into a very distinct memory, an incident that had occurred many years before when he was on the road with Drizzt, Bruenor, and Regis seeking the dwarf\u0027s ancestral home of Mithral Hall. Part of him wanted to turn away from that totem, to run far from this place, but one particular memory, a vow of vengeance, nagged at him. Hardly registering the movements, Wulfgar found a recent trail and followed it, soon coming to a hillock, and from the top of that bluff he spied the encampment, a cluster of deerskin tents with people, tall and strong and dark-haired, moving all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sky Ponies,\" Wulfgar whispered, remembering well the barbarian tribe that had come into a battle he and his friends had fought against an orc group. After the orcs had been cut down, Wulfgar, Bruenor, and Regis had been taken prisoner. They had been treated fairly well, and Wulfgar had been offered a challenge of strength, which he easily won, against the son of the chieftain. And then, in honorable barbarian tradition, Wulfgar had been offered a place among the tribesmen. Unfortunately, for a test of loyalty Wulfgar had been asked to slay Regis, and that he could never do. With Drizzt\u0027s help, the friends had escaped, but then the shaman, Valric High Eye, had used evil magic to transform Torlin, the chieftain\u0027s son, into a hideous ghost spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey defeated that spirit. When honorable Torlin\u0027s deformed, broken body lay at his feet, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, had vowed vengeance against Valric High Eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian felt the clamminess in his strong hands subconsciously wringing about the handle of his powerful warhammer. He squinted into the distance, staring hard at the encampment, and discerned a skinny, agitated form that might have been Valric skipping past one tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValric might not even still be alive, Wulfgar reminded himself, for the shaman had been very old those years ago. Again a large part of Wulfgar wanted to sprint down the other side of the hillock, to run far away from this encounter and any other that would remind him of his past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image of Torlin\u0027s broken, mutilated body, half man, half winged horse, stayed clear in his thoughts, though, and he could not turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the hour, he stared at the encampment from a much closer perspective, close enough to see the individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose enough to understand that the Sky Ponies had fallen on hard times. And into difficult battles, he realized, for many wounded sat about the camp, and the overall numbers of tents and folk seemed much reduced from what he remembered. Most of the folk in camp were women or very old or very young. A string of more than two-score poles to the south helped to clear up the mystery, for upon them were set the heads of orcs, the occasional carrion bird fluttering down to find a perch in scraggly hair, poking down to find a feast of an eyeball or the side of a nostril.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of the Sky Ponies so obviously diminished pained Wulfgar greatly, for though he had sworn vengeance on their shaman, he knew them to be an honorable people, much like his own in tradition and practice. He thought then that he should leave them, but even as he turned to go, one tent flap at the corner of his line of vision pushed open and out hopped a skinny man, ancient but full of energy, wearing white robes that feathered out like the wings of a bird whenever he raised his arms, and even more telling, an eye patch set with a huge emerald. Barbarians lowered their gazes wherever he passed; one child even rushed up to him and kissed the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valric,\" Wulfgar muttered, for there could be no mistaking the shaman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar came up from the grass in a steady, determined walk, Aegis-fang swinging at the end of one arm. The mere fact that he broke through the camp\u0027s perimeter without being assaulted showed him just how disorganized and decimated this tribe truly was, for no barbarian tribe would ever be caught so off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Wulfgar had passed the first tents, had moved close enough to Valric High Eye for the shaman to see him and stare at him incredulously before the first warrior, a tall, older man, strong but very lean, moved to block him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior came in swinging, not talking, launching a sidelong sweep with a heavy club, but Wulfgar, quicker than the man could anticipate, stepped ahead and caught the club in his free hand before it could gain too much momentum, and then, with strength beyond anything the man had ever imagined, turned his wrist and pulled the weapon free, tossing it far to the side. The warrior howled and charged right in, but Wulfgar got his arm across between himself and the man. With a mighty sweep of his arm, Wulfgar sent the man stumbling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the camp\u0027s warriors, not nearly as many as Wulfgar remembered from the Sky Ponies, were out then, flanking Valric, forming a semicircle from the shaman out to the sides of the huge intruder. Wulfgar did turn his gaze from the hated Valric long enough to scrutinize the group, long enough to take note that these were not strong men of prime warrior age. They were too young or too old. The Sky Ponies, he understood, had recently fought a tremendous battle and had not fared well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you who comes uninvited?\" asked one man, large and strong but very old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar looked hard at the speaker, at the keen set of his eyes, the peppered gray hair in a tousled mop, thick indeed for one his age, at the firm and proud set of his jaw. He reminded Wulfgar of another Sky Pony he had once met, an honorable and brave warrior, and that, combined with the fact that the man had spoken above all others, and even before Valric, confirmed Wulfgar\u0027s suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father of Torlin,\" he said, and gave a bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s eyes widened with surprise. He seemed as if he wanted to respond but could find no words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerek Wolf Slayer!\" Valric shrieked. \"Chieftain of the Sky Ponies. Who are you who comes uninvited? Who are you who speaks of Jerek\u0027s long-lost son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lost?\" Wulfgar echoed skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taken by the gods,\" Valric replied, waving his feathered arms. \"A hunting quest, turned to vision quest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wry smile made its way onto Wulfgar\u0027s face as he came to comprehend the tremendous, decade-old lie. Torlin, mutated into a ghastly and ghostly creature had been sent out by Valric to hunt Wulfgar and his companions and had died horribly on the field at their hands. But Valric, likely not wanting to face Jerek with the horrid news, had somehow manipulated the truth, had concocted a story that would keep Jerek in check. A hunting quest or a vision quest, both god-inspired, might last years, even decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar realized that he had to handle this delicately now, for any wrong or too-harsh statements might provoke the wrath of Jerek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hunting quest did not last,\" he said. \"For the gods, our gods, recognized the wrongness of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValric\u0027s eyes widened indeed, for the first time showing some measure of recognition. \"Who are you?\" he asked again, a hint of a tremor edging his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you not remember, Valric High Eye?\" Wulfgar asked, striding forward, and his movement caused those flanking the shaman to step forward as well. \"Have the Sky Ponies so soon forgotten the face of Wulfgar, son of Beornegar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValric tilted his head, his expression showing that Wulfgar had hit a chord of recognition there, but only vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have the Sky Ponies so soon forgotten the northerner they invited to join their ranks, the northerner who traveled with a dwarf, and a halfling, and,\" he paused, knowing that his next words would bring complete recognition, \"a blackskinned elf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValric\u0027s eyes nearly rolled out of their sockets. \"You!\" he said, poking his trembling finger into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mention of the drow, probably the only dark elf any of these barbarians had ever seen, sparked the memories of many others. Whispered conversations erupted, and many barbarians grasped their weapons tightly, awaiting only a single word to begin their attack and slaughter of the intruder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar calmly held his ground. \"I am Wulfgar, son of Beornegar,\" he repeated firmly, focusing his gaze on Jerek Wolf Slayer. \"No enemy of the Sky Ponies. Distant kin to your people and to your ways. I have returned, as I vowed I would, when I saw dead Torlin on the field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead Torlin?\" many voices from warriors and those huddled behind them echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friends and I did not come as enemies of the Sky Ponies,\" Wulfgar went on, using what he expected to be the last few seconds of dialogue. \"Indeed we fought beside you against a common foe and won the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You refused us!\" Valric screamed. \"You insulted my people!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know of my son?\" Jerek demanded, pushing the shaman aside and stepping forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that Valric quested him with the spirit of the Sky Pony to destroy us,\" Wulfgar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You admit this, and yet you walk openly into our encampment?\" Jerek asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that your god was not with Torlin on that hunt, for we defeated the creature he had become.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him!\" Valric screamed. \"As we destroyed the orcs that came upon us in the dark of night, so shall we destroy the enemy that walks into our camp this day!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold!\" shouted Jerek, throwing his arms out wide. Not a Sky Pony took a step forward, though they seemed eager now, like a pack of hunting dogs straining against their leashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerek stepped out, walking to stand before Wulfgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar locked his gaze with the man, but not before he glanced past Jerek to Valric, the shaman fumbling with a leather pouch-a sacred bundle of mystical and magical components-at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son is dead?\" Jerek, barely a foot from Wulfgar, asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your god was not with him,\" Wulfgar replied. \"For his cause, Valric\u0027s cause, was not just.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew before he ever finished that his roundabout manner of telling Jerek had done little to calm the man, that the overriding information, that his son was indeed dead, was too powerful and painful for any explanation or justification. With a roar, the chieftain came at Wulfgar but the younger barbarian was ready, lifting his arm high to raise the intended punch, then snapping his hand down and over Jerek\u0027s extended arm, pulling the man off-balance. Wulfgar dropped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAegis-fang and shoved hard on Jerek\u0027s chest, releasing his hold and sending the man stumbling backward into the surprised warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScooping his warhammer as he went, Wulfgar charged forward, but so did the warriors, and the northern barbarian, to his ultimate frustration, knew that he would get nowhere near to Valric. He hoped for an open throwing path that he might take down the shaman before he, too, was killed, but then Valric surprised him, surprised everybody, by leaping forward through the line, howling a chant and throwing a burst of herbs and powders Wulfgar\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar felt the magical intrusion. Though the other warriors, Jerek included, backed away a few steps, he felt as if great black walls were closing in on him, stealing his strength, forcing him to hold in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaves and waves of immobilizing magic rolled on, Valric hopping about, throwing more powders, strengthening the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar felt himself sinking, felt the ground coming up to swallow him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not unfamiliar with such magics, though. Not at all. In his years in the Abyss, Errtu\u0027s minions, particularly the wicked succubi, had used similar spells to render him helpless that they might have their way with him. How many times he had felt such intrusions. He had learned how to defeat them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put up a wall of the purest rage, warding every magical suggestion of immobility with ten growls of anger, ten memories of Errtu and the succubi. Outwardly, though, the barbarian took great pains to seem defeated, to hold perfectly still, his warhammer dropping down to his side. He heard the chants of \"Valric High Eye\" and saw out of the corner of his eye several of the warriors turning in ceremonial dance, giving thanks to their god and to Valric, the human manifestation of that god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what does he speak?\" Jerek said to Valric. \"What quest fell upon Torlin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I told you,\" the skinny shaman replied, dancing out from the lines to stand before Wulfgar. \"A drow elf! This man, seeming so honorable, traveled beside a drow elf! Could any but Torlin have taken the beast magic and defeated this deadly foe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that Torlin was on a vision quest,\" Jerek argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so I believed,\" Valric lied. \"And perhaps he is. Do not believe the lies of this one! Did you see how easily the power of Uthgar defeated him, holding him helpless before us? More likely he returned because his friends, all three, were slain by powerful Torlin, and because he knew that he could not hope to find vengeance any other way, could not hope to defeat Torlin even with the aid of the drew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, did defeat Torlin in the contest of strength,\" another man remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was before he angered Uthgar!\" Valric howled. \"See him standing now, helpless and defeated-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word barely got out of his mouth before Wulfgar exploded into action, stepping forward and clamping one hand over the shaman\u0027s skinny face. With frightening power, Wulfgar lifted Valric into the air and slammed him back down to his feet repeatedly, then shook him wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What god, Valric?\" he roared. \"What claim have you of Uthgar above my own as a warrior of Tempus?\" To illustrate his point, and still with only one hand, Wulfgar tightened the bulging muscles in his arm and lifted Valric high into the air and held him there, perfectly steady, ignoring the man\u0027s flailing arms. \"Had Torlin killed my friends in honorable battle, then I would not have returned for vengeance,\" he said honestly to Jerek. \"I came not to avenge them, for they are well, all three. I came to avenge Torlin, a man of strength and honor, used so terribly by this wretch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valric is our shaman!\" more than one man yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar put him down to his feet with a growl, forcing him down to his knees and bent his head far back. Valric grabbed hard onto the man\u0027s forearm, crying out, \"Kill him!\" but Wulfgar only squeezed all the tighter, and Valric\u0027s words became a gurgling groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar looked around at the ring of warriors. Holding Valric so helpless had bought him some time, perhaps, but they would kill him, no doubt, when he was finished with the shaman. Still, it wasn\u0027t that thought that gave Wulfgar pause, for he hardly cared about his own life. Rather, it was the expression he saw upon Jerek\u0027s face, a look of a man so utterly defeated. Wulfgar had come in with news that could break the proud chieftain, and he knew that if he killed Valric now, and many others in the ensuing battle before he, too, was finally brought down, then Jerek would not likely recover. And neither, he understood, would the Sky Ponies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the pitiful Valric. While he had been contemplating his next move he had inadvertently pushed back and down. The skinny man was practically bent in half and seemed near to breaking. How easy it would have been for Wulfgar to drive his arm down, snapping the man\u0027s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow easy and how empty. With a frustrated roar that had nothing to do with compassion, he lifted Valric from the ground again, clapped his free hand against the man\u0027s groin, and brought him high overhead. With a roar, he launched the man a dozen feet and more into the side of a tent, sending Valric, skins, and poles tumbling down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarriors came at him, but he quickly had Aegis-fang in hand, and a great swipe drove them back, knocking the weapon from one and nearly tearing the man\u0027s arm off in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold!\" came Jerek\u0027s cry. \"And you, Valric!\" he emphatically added, seeing the shaman pulling himself from the mess, calling for Wulfgar\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerek walked past his warriors, right up to Wulfgar. The younger man saw the murderous intent in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will take no pleasure in killing the father of Torlin,\" Wulfgar said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hit a nerve; Wulfgar saw the softening in the older man\u0027s face. Without another word, the barbarian turned about and started walking away, and none of the warriors moved to intercept him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him!\" Valric cried, but before the words had even left his mouth, Wulfgar whirled about and let fly his warhammer, the spinning weapon covering the twenty feet to the kneeling shaman in the blink of an eye, striking him squarely in the chest and laying him out, quite dead, among the jumble of tent poles and skins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes turned back to Wulfgar, and more than one Sky Pony made a move his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Aegis-fang was back in his hands, suddenly, dramatically, and they fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His god Tempus is with him!\" one man cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar turned about and started away once more, knowing in his heart that nothing could be further from the truth. He expected Jerek to run him down or to order his warriors to kill him, but the group behind him remained strangely quiet. He heard no commands, no protests, no movement. Nothing at all. He had so overwhelmed the already battered tribe, had stunned Jerek with the truth of his son\u0027s fate, and then had stunned them all by his sudden and brutal vengeance on Valric, that they simply didn\u0027t know how to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo relief came over Wulfgar as he made his way from the encampment. He stormed down the road, angry at damned Valric, at all the damned Sky Ponies, at all the damned world. He kicked a stone from the path, then picked up another sizable rock and hurled it far through the air, shouting a roar of open defiance and pure frustration behind it. He stomped along with no direction in mind, with no sense of where he should go or where he should be. Soon after, he came upon the trail of a party of orcs, likely the same ones who had battled the Sky Ponies the previous night, an easily discernible track of blood, trampled grass, and broken twigs, veering from the main path into a small forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly thinking, Wulfgar turned down that path, still roughly pushing aside trees, growling, and muttering curses. Gradually, though, he calmed and quieted, and replaced his lack of general purpose with a short-term, specific goal. He followed the trail more carefully, paying attention to any side paths where flanking orc scouts might have moved. Indeed, he found one such path and a pair of tracks to confirm it. He went that way quietly, looking for shadows and cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day was late by then, the shadows long, but Wulfgar understood that he would have a hard time finding the scouts before they spotted him if they were on the alert-as they likely would be so soon after a terrific battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar had spent many years fighting humanoids beside Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, learning of their methods and their motivations. His course now was to make sure that the orcs were not able to warn the larger group. He knew how to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouched in some brush by the side, the barbarian wrapped pliable twigs about his warhammer, trying to disguise the weapon as much as possible. Then he smeared mud about his face and pulled his cloak back so that it looked as though it was torn. Dirty and appearing battered, he walked out of the brush and started along the path, limping badly and groaning with every step, and every so often calling out for \"my girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a short time later he sensed that he was being watched. Now he exaggerated his limp, even stumbling down to the ground at one point, using his tumble to allow him a better scan of the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted a dark silhouette among the branches, an orc with a spear poised for a throw. Just a few steps more, he realized, and the creature would try to skewer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the other was about, he realized, though he hadn\u0027t spotted the wretch. Likely it was on the ground, ready to run in and finish him as soon as the spear took him down. These two should have warned their companions, but they wanted the apparently easy kill for themselves, Wulfgar knew, that they might loot the poor man before informing their leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar had to take them out quickly, but he didn\u0027t dare get much closer to the spear wielder. He pulled himself to his feet, took another staggering step along the trail, then paused and lifted his arm and eyes to the sky, wailing for his missing child. Then, nearly falling over again, shoulders slumped in defeat, he turned around and started back the way he had come, sobbing loudly, shoulders bobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that the orc would never be able to resist that target, despite the range. His muscles tensed, he turned his head just a bit, hearing trained on the distant tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he spun as the long-flying spear soared in. Deftly, with agility far beyond any man of his size, he caught the missile as he turned, pulling it tight against his side and issuing a profound grunt, then tumbling backward into the dirt, squirming, right hand grasping the spear, left tight about Aegis-fang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the rustle to the side from an angle above his right shoulder as he lay on his back, waiting patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second orc came out of the brush, scampering his way. Wulfgar timed the move with near perfection, rolling up and over that right shoulder, letting the spear fall as he went. He came up in a spin, Aegis-fang swiping across. But the orc skidded short, and the mighty weapon swished past harmlessly. Hardly concerned, Wulfgar continued the spin, right around, spotting the spear thrower on the tree branch as he came around and letting fly. He had to continue the spin, couldn\u0027t pause and watch the throw, though he heard the crunch and grunt, and the orc\u0027s broken body falling through the lower branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orc before him yelped and threw its club, then turned and tried to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar accepted the hit as the club bounced off his massive chest. In an instant, he held the creature on its knees as he had held Valric, on its knees, head far back, backbone bowed. He pictured that moment then, conjuring an image of the wicked shaman. Then he drove down, with all his strength, growling and slapping away the orc\u0027s flailing arms. He heard the crackle of backbone and those arms stopped slapping at him, stabbing straight up into the air, trembling violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar let go, and the dead creature fell over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAegis-fang came back to his grasp, reminding him of the other orc, and he glanced over and nodded, seeing the thing lying dead at the base of the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly satisfied, his bloodlust rising with each kill, Wulfgar ran, back to the main trail and then down along the clear path. He found the orcish encampment as twilight descended. There were more than a score of the monsters, with others likely out and about, scouting or hunting. He should have waited until long after dark, until the camp had settled and many of the orcs were asleep. He should have waited until he could get a better picture of the group, a better understanding of their structure and strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have waited, but he could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAegis-fang soared in, right between a pair of smaller orcs, startling them, then on to slam one large creature, taking it and the orc it had been talking to down to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charged Wulfgar, roaring wildly. He caught the spear of one startled orc, stabbing it across to impale the orc opposite, then tearing free the tip and spinning back, smashing the spear down across the first orc\u0027s head, breaking it in half. Holding both ends, Wulfgar jabbed them into either side of the orc\u0027s head, and when it reached up to grab the poles, the barbarian merely heaved it right over his head. A heavy punch dropped the next orc in line even as it moved to draw the sword from its belt, and then, roaring all the louder, Wulfgar crashed into two more, bearing them to the ground. He came up slapping and punching, kicking, anything at all to knock the orcs aside-and in truth, they showed more desire to scramble away than to come at the monstrous man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar caught one, spun it about, and slammed his forehead right into its face, then caught it by the hair as it fell away and drove his fist through its ugly face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian leaped about, seeking his next victim. His momentum seemed to be fast waning with the passing seconds, but then Aegis-fang returned to his hand, and he wasted no time in whipping the hammer a dozen feet, its spinning head coming in at just the right angle to drive through the skull of one unfortunate creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrcs charged in, stabbing and clubbing. Wulfgar took one hit, then another, but with each minor gash or bruise the orcs inflicted, the huge and powerful man got his hands on one and tore the life from it. Then Aegis-fang returned again, and the orcish press was shattered, driven back by mighty swipes. Covered in blood, howling wildly, thrashing that terrible hammer, the sheer sight of Wulfgar proved too much for the cowardly creatures. Those who could get away fled into the forest, and those who could not died at the barbarian\u0027s strong hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMere minutes later, Wulfgar stomped out of the shattered camp, growling and smacking Aegis-fang against the trees. He knew that many orcs were watching him; he knew that none would dare attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after, he came into a clearing on a bluff that afforded him a view of the last moments of sunset, the same fiery lines he had seen on that evening on the southern edges of the Spine of the World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the colors did not touch his heart. Now he knew the thoughts of freedom from his past were a false hope, knew that his memories would follow him wherever he went, whatever he did. He felt no satisfaction at exacting revenge against Valric and no joy in slaughtering the orcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked on through the night, not even bothering to wash the blood from his clothes or to dress his many minor wounds. He walked toward the sunset, then kept the rising moon at his back, chasing its descent to the western horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later, he found Luskan\u0027s eastern gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-11.html","bookId":2131,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:51 PM"}
