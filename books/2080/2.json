Her awareness was fragmented and understanding came to her in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epieces because she simply couldn\u0027t take in the whole situation at once. It was too bizarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she simply thought of a bomb. The explosion was that loud. Then she realized that something had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome in the window, that it had come flying through the glass. And that it was in the room with her now,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrouching among the broken shards of windowpane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven then, she couldn\u0027t identify it. It was too incongruous; her mind refused to recognize the shape\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimmediately. Something pretty big-something dark, it offered. A body like a dog\u0027s but set higher, with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elonger legs. Yellow eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as if the right lens had suddenly clicked in front of her eyes, she saw it clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wolf. There was a big black wolf in the room with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gorgeous animal, rangy and muscular, with ebony-colored fur and a white streak on its throat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike a bolt of lightning. It was looking at her fixedly, with an almost human expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEscaped fromYellowstone , Hannah thought dazedly. The naturalists were reintroducing wolves to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epark, weren\u0027t they? It couldn\u0027t be wild; Ryan Harden\u0027s great-grandpa had bragged for years about killing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe last wolf in Amador county when he was a boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, she told herself, wolves don\u0027t attack people. They never attack people. A single wolf would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever attack a full-grown teenager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the time her conscious mind was thinking this, something deeper was making her move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made her back up slowly, never taking her eyes off the wolf, until she felt the bookcase behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s something you need to get, a voice in her mind was whispering to her. It wasn\u0027t like the voice of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother person, but it wasn\u0027t exactly like her own mental voice, either. It was a voice like a dark cool\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewind: competent and rather bleak. Something you saw on a shelf earlier, it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an impossibly graceful motion, from eight feet away, the wolf leaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to be scared. Hannah saw a bushy, flowing black arc coming at her and then she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslammed into the bookcase. For a while after that, everything was simply chaos. Books and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknick-knacks were falling around her. She was trying to get her balance, trying to push the heaviness of a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efurry body away from her. The wolf was falling back, then jumping again as she twisted sideways to get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the strangest thing was that she actually was getting away. Or at least evading the worst of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewolf\u0027s lunges, which seemed to be aimed at knocking her to the floor. Her body was moving as if this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere, somehow instinctive to her, as if she knew how to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0027t know this. I never fight... and I\u0027ve certainly never played dodge ball with a wolf before....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she thought it, her movements slowed. She didn\u0027t feel sure and instinctive any longer. She felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econfused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wolf seemed to know it. Its eyes glowed eerily yellow in the light of a lamp that was lying on its\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eside. They were such strange eyes, more intense and more savage than any animal\u0027s she\u0027d ever seen. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaw it draw its legs beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove-now, the mysterious new part of her mind snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah moved. The wolf hit the bookcase with incredible force, and then the bookcase itself was falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah flung herself sideways in time to avoid being crushed-but the case fell with an unholy noise\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edirectly in front of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrapped, the dark cool voice in Hannah\u0027s mind noted analytically. No exit anymore, except the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah? Hannah?\" It was Paul\u0027s voice just outside the room. The door flew open-all of four inches. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejammed against the fallen bookcase. \"God-what\u0027s going on in there? Hannah? Hannah!\" He sounded\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epanicked now, banging the door uselessly against the blockage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t think about him, the new part of Hannah\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emind said sharply, but Hannah couldn\u0027t help it. He sounded so desperate. She opened her mouth to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshout back to him, her concentration broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wolf lunged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Hannah didn\u0027t move fast enough. A terrible weight smashed into her and she was falling, flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe landed hard, her head smacking into the floorboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she felt it, everything grayed out. Her vision went sparkling, her mind soared away from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epain, and a strange thought flickered through her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m dead now. It\u0027s over again. Oh, Isis, Goddess of Life, guide me to the other world....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah! Hannah! What\u0027s going on in there?\" Paul\u0027s frantic voice came to her dimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s vision cleared and the bizarre thoughts vanished. She wasn\u0027t soaring in sparkling emptiness and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe wasn\u0027t dead. She was lying on the floor with a book\u0027s sharp corner in the small of her back and a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewolf on her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the midst of her terror, she felt a strange appalled fascination. She had never seen a wild animal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis close. She could see the white-tipped guard hairs standing erect on its face and neck; she could see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaliva glistening on its lolling red tongue. She could smell its breath-humid and hot, vaguely dog-like but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch wilder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she couldn\u0027t move, she realized. The wolf was as long as she was tall, and it weighed more than she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edid. Pinned underneath it, she was utterly helpless. All she could do was lie there shivering as the narrow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealmost delicate muzzle got closer and closer to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes closed involuntarily as she felt the cold wetness of its nose on her cheek. It wasn\u0027t an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaffectionate gesture. The wolf was nudging at strands of her hair that had fallen across her face. Using its\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuzzle like a hand to push the hair away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, please make it stop, Hannah thought. But she was the only one who could stop this-and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t know how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the cold nose was moving across her cheekbone. Its sniffing was loud in her ear. The wolf seemed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be smelling her, tasting her, and looking at her all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Not looking at me. Looking at my birthmark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another one of those ridiculous, impossible thoughts-and it snapped into place like the last piece in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea puzzle deep inside her. Irrational as it was, Hannah felt absolutely certain it was true. And it set off the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecool wind voice in her mind again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReach out, the voice whispered, quiet and businesslike. Feel around you. The weapon has to be there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomewhere. You saw it on the bookcase. Find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf stopped its explorations, seeming satisfied. It lifted its head... and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally laughed. It was the eeriest and most frightening thing Hannah had ever seen. The big mouth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eopened, panting, showing teeth, and the yellow eyes blazed with hot bestial triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurry, hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s eyes were helplessly fixed on the sharp white teeth ten inches away from her face, but her hand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas creeping out, feeling along the smooth pine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloorboards around her. Her fingers glided over books, over the feathery texture of a fern-and then over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething square and cold and faced with glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf didn\u0027t seem to notice. Its lips were pulling back farther and farther. Not laughing anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah could see its short front teeth and its long curving canines. She could see its forehead wrinkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she could feel its body vibrate in a low and vicious growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of absolute savagery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cool wind voice had taken over Hannah\u0027s mind completely. It was telling her what would happen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enext. The wolf would sink his teeth into her throat and then shake her, tearing skin and ripping muscles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway. Her blood would spray like a fountain. It would fill her severed windpipe and her lungs and her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emouth. She would die gasping and choking, maybe drowning before she bled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept. . . that she had silver in her hand. A silver picture frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill it, the cool voice whispered. You\u0027ve got the right weapon. Hit it dead in the eye with a corner. Drive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilver into its brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s ordinary mind didn\u0027t even try to figure out how a picture frame could possibly be the right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweapon. It didn\u0027t object, either. But faint and faraway, there came another voice in her head. Like the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecool wind voice, it wasn\u0027t hers, but it wasn\u0027t someone else\u0027s, either. It was a clear crystal voice that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to sparkle in jeweled colors as it spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are not a killer. You don\u0027t kill. You have never killed, no matter what happened to you. You do not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t kill, Hannah thought slowly, in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you\u0027re going to die, the cool wind voice said brutally, much louder than the crystal voice. Because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis animal won\u0027t stop until either it\u0027s dead or you are. There\u0027s no other way to deal with these creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it happened. The wolf\u0027s mouth opened. In a lightning-fast move, it darted for her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah didn\u0027t think. She brought the picture frame up ... and slammed it into the side of the wolf\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot into the eye. Into the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the impact-hard metal against sensitive flesh. The wolf gave a yelping squeal and staggered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esideways, shaking its head and hitting at its face with a forepaw. Its weight was off her for an instant, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean instant was all Hannah needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body moved without her conscious direction, sliding out from under the wolf, twisting and jumping\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her grasp on the picture frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow. Look around! The bookcase-no, you can\u0027t move it. The window! Go for the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the wolf had stopped shaking its head. Even as Hannah started across the room, it turned and saw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. In one flowing, bushy leap it put itself between her and the window. Then it stood looking at her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevery hair on its body bristling. Its teeth were bared, its ears upright, and its eyes glared with pure hatred\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s going to spring, Hannah realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not a killer. I can\u0027t kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t have any choice-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf sprang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it never reached her. Something else came soaring through the window and knocked it off course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Hannah\u0027s eyes and brain identified the creature at once. Another wolf. My God, what is going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new animal was gray-brown, smaller than the black wolf and not as striking. Its legs were amazingly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edelicate, twined with veins and sinews like a racehorse\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA female, something faraway in Hannah\u0027s mind said with dreamlike certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth wolves had recovered their balance now. They were on their feet, bristling. The room smelled like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea zoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I\u0027m really going to die, Hannah thought. I\u0027m going to be torn to pieces by two wolves. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill clutching the picture frame, but she knew there was no chance of fighting them both off at once. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere going to rip her to bits, quarreling over who got more of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was pounding so hard that it shook her body, and her ears were ringing. The female wolf was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estaring at her with eyes more amber than yellow, and Hannah stared back, mesmerized, waiting for it to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake its move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf held the gaze for another moment, as if studying Hannah\u0027s face-in particular the left side of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface. Her cheek. Then she turned her back to Hannah and faced the black wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtecting me, Hannah thought, stunned. It was unbelievable-but she was beyond disbelief at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had stepped out of her ordinary life and into a fairy tale full of almost-human wolves. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eentire world had gone crazy and all she could do was try to deal with each moment as it came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re going to fight, the cool wind voice in her mind told her. As soon as they\u0027re into it, run for the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment everything erupted into bedlam. The gray wolf had launched herself at the black. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroom echoed with the sound of snarling-and of teeth clicking together as both wolves snapped again and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah couldn\u0027t make out what was going on in the fight. It was just a blurred chaos as the wolves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecircled and darted and leaped and ducked. But it was by far the most terrifying thing she had ever\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewitnessed. Like the worst dog fight imaginable, like the feeding frenzy of sharks. Both animals seemed to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave gone berserk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly there was a yelp of pain. Blood welled up on the gray female\u0027s flank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s too small, Hannah thought. Too light. She doesn\u0027t have a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp her, the crystal voice whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an insane suggestion. Hannah couldn\u0027t even imagine trying to get in the middle of that snarling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhirlwind. But somehow she found herself moving anyway. Placing herself behind the gray wolf. It didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ematter that she didn\u0027t believe she was doing it, or that she had no idea how to team up with a wolf in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efighting another wolf. She was there and she was holding her silver picture frame high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black wolf pulled away from the fight to stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there they stood, all three of them panting, Hannah with fear and the wolves with exertion. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere frozen like a tableau in the middle of the wrecked office, all looking at each other tensely. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblack wolf on one side, his eyes shining with single-minded menace. The gray wolf on the other, blood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ematting her coat, bits of fur floating away from her. And Hannah right behind her, holding up the picture\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eframe in a shaking hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s ears were filled with the deep reverberating sound of growling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a deafening report that cut through the room like a knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gunshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black wolf yelped and staggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s senses had been focused on what was going on inside the room for so long that it was a shock\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto realize there was anything, outside it. She was dimly aware that Paul\u0027s yells had stopped some time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eago, but she hadn\u0027t stopped to consider what that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with adrenaline washing over her, she heard his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah! Get out of the way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shout was tense, edged with fear and anger- and determination. It came from the opposite side of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe room, from the darkness outside the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul was there at the broken window with a gun. His face was pale and his hand was shaking. He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaiming in the general direction of the wolves. If he fired again he might hit either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get into a corner!\" The gun bobbed nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah heard herself say, \"Don\u0027t shoot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice came out hoarse and unused-sounding. She moved to get in between the gun and the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t shoot,\" she said again. \"Don\u0027t hit the gray one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hit the gray one?\" Paul\u0027s voice rose in something like hysterical laughter. \"I don\u0027t even know if I can hit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe wall! This is the first time I\u0027ve ever shot a gun. So just-just try to get out of the way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Hannah moved toward him, holding out her hand. \"I can shoot. Just give it to me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just move out of the way-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun went off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant Hannah couldn\u0027t see where the bullet had gone and she wondered wildly if she had been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshot. Then she saw that the black wolf was lurching backward. Blood dripped from its neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteel won\u0027t kill it, the wind voice hissed. You\u0027re only making it more angry. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the black wolf was swinging its head to look with blazing eyes from Hannah with her picture frame\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto Paul with his gun, to the gray wolf with her teeth. The gray wolf snarled just then and Hannah had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever seen an animal look closer to being smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more shot...\" Paul breathed. \"While it\u0027s cornered...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEars flat, the black wolf turned toward the only other window in the room. It launched into a vaulting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleap straight toward the unbroken glass. There was a shattering crash as it went through. Glass fragments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflew everywhere, tinkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stared dizzily at the curtains swirling first outside, then inside the room, and then her head\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esnapped around to look at the gray wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmber eyes met hers directly. It was such a human stare... and definitely the look of an equal. Almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe look of a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the gray wolf twisted and loped for the newly broken window. Two steps and a leap-she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom somewhere outside there came a long drawn-out howl of anger and defiance. It was fading, as if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe wolf was moving away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees literally felt as if they wanted to buckle. But she made herself move to the window, glass\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrating under her boots as she stared into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was bright, one day past full. She thought she could just see a dark shape loping toward the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eopen prairie, but it might have been her imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out her breath and sagged against the window. The silver picture frame fell to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hurt? Are you okay?\" Paul was climbing through the other window. He tripped on a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewaste-basket getting across the room, then he was beside her, grabbing for her shoulders, trying to look\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m all right.\" She was numb, was what she was. She felt dazed and fragmented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked at her. \"Um .. . you have some particular fondness for gray wolves or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shook her head. How could she ever explain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at each other for a moment, and then, simultaneously, they both sank to the floor, squatting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eamong the shards of glass, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s face was white, his red hair disheveled, his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes large and stunned. He ran a shaky hand over his forehead, then put the gun down and patted it. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwisted his neck to stare at the wreck of his office, the overturned bookcase, the scattered books and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknickknacks, the two broken windows, the glass fragments, the bullet hole, the flecks of blood, and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etufts of wolf hair that still drifted across the pine floorboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah said faintly, \"So who was at the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul blinked twice. \"Nobody. Nobody was at the door.\" He added almost dreamily, \"I wonder if wolves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan ring doorbells?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul turned to look straight at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has it ever occurred to you,\" he blurted, \"that you may not be paranoid after all? I mean, that something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweird and uncanny really is out to get you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny,\" Hannah whispered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean-\" Paul gestured around the room, half-laughing. He looked punch-drunk. \"I mean, you said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething was going to happen-and something did.\" He stopped laughing and looked at her with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewondering speculation. \"You really did know, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah glared at the man who was supposed to guide her back to sanity. \"Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul blinked. He looked shocked and embarrassed, then he glanced away and shook his head. \"God, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know. Sorry; that wasn\u0027t very professional, was it? But...\" He stared out the window. \"Well, for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoment it just seemed possible that you\u0027ve got some kind of secret locked up there in your brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething... extraordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah said nothing. She was trying to forget\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout too many things at once: the new part of her that whispered strategies, the wolves with human\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes, the silver picture frame. She had no idea what all these things added up to, and she didn\u0027t want to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow. She wanted to force them away from her and go back to the safe ordinary world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eofSacajaweaHigh School .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul cleared his throat, still looking out the window. His voice was uncertain and almost apologetic. \"It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan\u0027t be true, of course. There\u0027s got to be a rational explanation. But-well, if it were true, it occurs to me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat somebody had better unlock that secret.
