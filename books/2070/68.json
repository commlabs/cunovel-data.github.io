She could not look behind her, must not look behind her. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it was painted red. She walked faster, and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea, the living plain, rich with the smells of earth and death. Wind stirred the grasses, and they rippled like water. Drogo held her in strong arms, and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone, and the stars smiled down on them, stars in a daylight sky. \"Home,\" she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . don\u0027t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSer Jorah\u0027s face was drawn and sorrowful. \"Rhaegar was the last dragon,\" he told her. He warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was there and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. \"The last dragon,\" he whispered, thin as a wisp, and was gone. She felt the dark behind her, and the red door seemed farther away than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . don\u0027t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViserys stood before her, screaming. \"The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\" The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. \"I am the dragon and I will be crowned!\" he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . don\u0027t want to wake the dragon . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red door was so far ahead of her, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her. If it caught her she would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness. She began to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . don\u0027t want to wake the dragon . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel the heat inside her, a terrible burning in her womb. Her son was tall and proud, with Drogo\u0027s copper skin and her own silver-gold hair, violet eyes shaped like almonds. And he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers, but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out. She saw his heart burning through his chest, and in an instant he was gone, consumed like a moth by a candle, turned to ash. She wept for her child, the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast, but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . want to wake the dragon . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhosts lined the hallway, dressed in the faded raiment of kings. In their hands were swords of pale fire. They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and their eyes were opal and amethyst, tourmaline and jade. \"Faster,\" they cried, \"faster, faster.\" She raced, her feet melting the stone wherever they touched. \"Faster!\" the ghosts cried as one, and she screamed and threw herself forward. A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . wake the dragon . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . the dragon . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a stallion as black as his armor. Fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm. \"The last dragon,\" Ser Jorah\u0027s voice whispered faintly. \"The last, the last.\" Dany lifted his polished black visor. The face within was her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, for a long time, there was only the pain, the fire within her, and the whisperings of stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke to the taste of ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she moaned, \"no, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Khaleesi?\" Jhiqui hovered over her, a frightened doe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tent was drenched in shadow, still and close. Flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier, and Dany followed them with her eyes through the smoke hole above. Flying, she thought. I had wings, I was flying. But it was only a dream. \"Help me,\" she whispered, struggling to rise. \"Bring me . . . \" Her voice was raw as a wound, and she could not think what she wanted. Why did she hurt so much? It was as if her body had been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps. \"I want . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Khaleesi.\" Quick as that Jhiqui was gone, bolting from the tent, shouting. Dany needed . . . something . . . someone . . . what? It was important, she knew. It was the only thing in the world that mattered. She rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her, fighting the blanket tangled about her legs. It was so hard to move. The world swam dizzily. I have to . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found her on the carpet, crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah Mormont lifted her in his arms and carried her back to her sleeping silks, while she struggled feebly against him. Over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids, Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache, and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur. \"I must,\" she tried to tell them, \"I have to . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . sleep, Princess,\" Ser Jorah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dany said. \"Please. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He covered her with silk, though she was burning. \"Sleep and grow strong again, Khaleesi. Come back to us.\" And then Mirri Maz Duur was there, the maegi, tipping a cup against her lips. She tasted sour milk, and something else, something thick and bitter. Warm liquid ran down her chin. Somehow she swallowed. The tent grew dimmer, and sleep took her again. This time she did not dream. She floated, serene and at peace, on a black sea that knew no shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a time—a night, a day, a year, she could not say—she woke again. The tent was dark, its silken walls flapping like wings when the wind gusted outside. This time Dany did not attempt to rise. \"Irri,\" she called, \"Jhiqui. Doreah.\" They were there at once. \"My throat is dry,\" she said, \"so dry,\" and they brought her water. It was warm and flat, yet Dany drank it eagerly, and sent Jhiqui for more. Irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow. \"I have been sick,\" Dany said. The Dothraki girl nodded. \"How long?\" The cloth was soothing, but Irri seemed so sad, it frightened her. \"Long,\" she whispered. When Jhiqui returned with more water, Mirri Maz Duur came with her, eyes heavy from sleep. \"Drink,\" she said, lifting Dany\u0027s head to the cup once more, but this time it was only wine. Sweet, sweet wine. Dany drank, and lay back, listening to the soft sound of her own breathing. She could feel the heaviness in her limbs, as sleep crept in to fill her up once more. \"Bring me . . . \" she murmured, her voice slurred and drowsy. \"Bring . . . I want to hold . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" the maegi asked. \"What is it you wish, Khaleesi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring me . . . egg . . . dragon\u0027s egg . . . please . . . \" Her lashes turned to lead, and she was too weary to hold them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she woke the third time, a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through the smoke hole of the tent, and her arms were wrapped around a dragon\u0027s egg. It was the pale one, its scales the color of butter cream, veined with whorls of gold and bronze, and Dany could feel the heat of it. Beneath her bedsilks, a fine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin. Dragondew, she thought. Her fingers trailed lightly across the surface of the shell, tracing the wisps of gold, and deep in the stone she felt something twist and stretch in response. It did not frighten her. All her fear was gone, burned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDany touched her brow. Under the film of sweat, her skin was cool to the touch, her fever gone. She made herself sit. There was a moment of dizziness, and the deep ache between her thighs. Yet she felt strong. Her maids came running at the sound of her voice. \"Water,\" she told them, \"a flagon of water, cold as you can find it. And fruit, I think. Dates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, Khaleesi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want Ser Jorah,\" she said, standing. Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders. \"And a warm bath, and Mirri Maz Duur, and . . . \" Memory came back to her all at once, and she faltered. \"Khal Drogo,\" she forced herself to say, watching their faces with dread. \"Is he\u0026amp;mdash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The khal lives,\" Irri answered quietly . . . yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words, and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to Doreah. \"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . I shall bring Ser Jorah,\" the Lysene girl said, bowing her head and fleeing the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJhiqui would have run as well, but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive. \"What is it? I must know. Drogo . . . and my child.\" Why had she not remembered the child until now? \"My son . . . Rhaego . . . where is he? I want him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer handmaid lowered her eyes. \"The boy . . . he did not live, Khaleesi.\" Her voice was a frightened whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDany released her wrist. My son is dead, she thought as Jhiqui left the tent. She had known somehow. She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui\u0027s tears. No, she had known before she woke. Her dream came back to her, sudden and vivid, and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid, bursting into flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should weep, she knew, yet her eyes were dry as ash. She had wept in her dream, and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks. All the grief has been burned out of me, she told herself. She felt sad, and yet . . . she could feel Rhaego receding from her, as if he had never been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSer Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing over the other dragon\u0027s eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with, which was passing strange. \"Ser Jorah, come here,\" she said. She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls. \"What do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shell, hard as rock.\" The knight was wary. \"Scales.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Cold stone.\" He took his hand away. \"Princess, are you well? Should you be up, weak as you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weak? I am strong, Jorah.\" To please him, she reclined on a pile of cushions. \"Tell me how my child died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never lived, my princess. The women say . . . \" He faltered, and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him, and the way he limped when he moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me. Tell me what the women say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his face away. His eyes were haunted. \"They say the child was . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited, but Ser Jorah could not say it. His face grew dark with shame. He looked half a corpse himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monstrous,\" Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous. \"Twisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat. When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness, Dany thought. The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her. If she looked back she was lost. \"My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent,\" she said. \"I could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be as it may be,\" answered Mirri Maz Duur, \"yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said. Death was in that tent, Khaleesi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only shadows,\" Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice. \"I saw, maegi. I saw you, alone, dancing with the shadows. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The grave casts long shadows, Iron Lord,\" Mirri said. \"Long and dark, and in the end no light can hold them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSer Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew. He had done what he did for love and loyalty, yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness. He knew it too; the grey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. \"The shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah,\" she told him. The knight made no reply. Dany turned to the godswife. \"You warned me that only death could pay for life. I thought you meant the horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mirri Maz Duur said. \"That was a lie you told yourself. You knew the price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she? Had she? If I look back I am lost. \"The price was paid,\" Dany said. \"The horse, my child, Quaro and Qotho, Haggo and Cohollo. The price was paid and paid and paid.\" She rose from her cushions. \"Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me, godswife, maegi, bloodmage, whatever you are. Show me Khal Drogo. Show me what I bought with my son\u0027s life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you command, Khaleesi,\" the old woman said. \"Come, I will take you to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDany was weaker than she knew. Ser Jorah slipped an arm around her and helped her stand. \"Time enough for this later, my princess,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would see him now, Ser Jorah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the dimness of the tent, the world outside was blinding bright. The sun burned like molten gold, and the land was seared and empty. Her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water, and Jhogo moved close to help Ser Jorah support her. Aggo and Rakharo stood behind. The glare of sun on sand made it hard to see more, until Dany raised her hand to shade her eyes. She saw the ashes of a fire, a few score horses milling listlessly and searching for a bite of grass, a scattering of tents and bedrolls. A small crowd of children had gathered to watch her, and beyond she glimpsed women going about their work, and withered old men staring at the flat blue sky with tired eyes, swatting feebly at bloodflies. A count might show a hundred people, no more. Where the other forty thousand had made their camp, only the wind and dust lived now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drogo\u0027s khalasar is gone,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A khal who cannot ride is no khal,\" said Jhogo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dothraki follow only the strong,\" Ser Jorah said. \"I am sorry, my princess. There was no way to hold them. Ko Pono left first, naming himself Khal Pono, and many followed him. Jhaqo was not long to do the same. The rest slipped away night by night, in large bands and small. There are a dozen new khalasars on the Dothraki sea, where once there was only Drogo\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The old remain,\" said Aggo. \"The frightened, the weak, and the sick. And we who swore. We remain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They took Khal Drogo\u0027s herds, Khaleesi,\" Rakharo said. \"We were too few to stop them. It is the right of the strong to take from the weak. They took many slaves as well, the khal\u0027s and yours, yet they left some few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eroeh?\" asked Dany, remembering the frightened child she had saved outside the city of the Lamb Men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mago seized her, who is Khal Jhaqo\u0027s bloodrider now,\" said Jhogo. \"He mounted her high and low and gave her to his khal, and Jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders. They were six. When they were done with her, they cut her throat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was her fate, Khaleesi,\" said Aggo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I look back I am lost. \"It was a cruel fate,\" Dany said, \"yet not so cruel as Mago\u0027s will be. I promise you that, by the old gods and the new, by the lamb god and the horse god and every god that lives. I swear it by the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World. Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dothraki exchanged uncertain glances. \"Khaleesi, \" the handmaid Irri explained, as if to a child, \"Jhaqo is a khal now, with twenty thousand riders at his back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head. \"And I am Daenerys Stormhorn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon\u0027s daughter, and I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was lying on the bare red earth, staring up at the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen bloodflies had settled on his body, though he did not seem to feel them. Dany brushed them away and knelt beside him. His eyes were wide open but did not see, and she knew at once that he was blind. When she whispered his name, he did not seem to hear. The wound on his breast was as healed as it would ever be, the scar that covered it grey and red and hideous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is he out here alone, in the sun?\" she asked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems to like the warmth, Princess,\" Ser Jorah said. \"His eyes follow the sun, though he does not see it. He can walk after a fashion. He will go where you lead him, but no farther. He will eat if you put food in his mouth, drink if you dribble water on his lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDany kissed her sun-and-stars gently on the brow, and stood to face Mirri Maz Duur. \"Your spells are costly, maegi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lives,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"You asked for life. You paid for life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was. His life was laughter, and meat roasting over a firepit, and a horse between his legs. His life was an arakh in his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy. His life was his bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirri Maz Duur made no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will he be as he was?\" Dany demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDany gestured at Ser Jorah and the others. \"Leave us. I would speak with this maegi alone.\" Mormont and the Dothraki withdrew. \"You knew,\" Dany said when they were gone. She ached, inside and out, but her fury gave her strength. \"You knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was wrong of them to burn my temple,\" the heavy, flat-nosed woman said placidly. \"That angered the Great Shepherd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was no god\u0027s work,\" Dany said coldly. If I look back I am lost. \"You cheated me. You murdered my child within me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spoke for you,\" she said, anguished. \"I saved you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saved me?\" The Lhazareen woman spat. \"Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth was in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\u0027s house burn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well, and in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my bread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons past. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips. Tell me again what you saved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirri Maz Duur laughed cruelly. \"Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDany called out for the men of her khas and bid them take Mirri Maz Duur and bind her hand and foot, but the maegi smiled at her as they carried her off, as if they shared a secret. A word, and Dany could have her head off . . . yet then what would she have? A head? If life was worthless, what was death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey led Khal Drogo back to her tent, and Dany commanded them to fill a tub, and this time there was no blood in the water. She bathed him herself, washing the dirt and the dust from his arms and chest, cleaning his face with a soft cloth, soaping his long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from it till it shone again as she remembered. It was well past dark before she was done, and Dany was exhausted. She stopped for drink and food, but it was all she could do to nibble at a fig and keep down a mouthful of water. Sleep would have been a release, but she had slept enough . . . too long, in truth. She owed this night to Drogo, for all the nights that had been, and yet might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of their first ride was with her when she led him out into the darkness, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man\u0027s life must be done beneath the open sky. She told herself that there were powers stronger than hatred, and spells older and truer than any the maegi had learned in Asshai. The night was black and moonless, but overhead a million stars burned bright. She took that for an omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo soft blanket of grass welcomed them here, only the hard dusty ground, bare and strewn with stones. No trees stirred in the wind, and there was no stream to soothe her fears with the gentle music of water. Dany told herself that the stars would be enough. \"Remember, Drogo,\" she whispered. \"Remember our first ride together, the day we wed. Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the khalasar all around us and your eyes on my face. Remember how cool and clean the water was in the Womb of the World. Remember, my sun-and-stars. Remember, and come back to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her, as she would have wanted, but Doreah had taught her other ways. Dany used her hands, her mouth, her breasts. She raked him with her nails and covered him with kisses and whispered and prayed and told him stories, and by the end she had bathed him with her tears. Yet Drogo did not feel, or speak, or rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that he was truly lost to her. \"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" she said sadly. \"When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child. Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever, the darkness cried, never never never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She clutched it to her breasts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. If I look back I am lost. It hurt even to walk, and she wanted to sleep, to sleep and not to dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-game-of-thrones-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-1/page-68.html","bookId":2070,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:26:26 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:26:26 AM"}
