Stefan didn\u0027t say it, but Elena knew it was what he was thinking. She could see it in the way he stared at her. She had never been so sure of her power. Except that actually he didn\u0027t look as if he were having a good time; he looked stricken, in pain, as if he couldn\u0027t take one more minute of this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe band was starting up, a slow dance. He was still staring at her, drinking her in. Those green eyes darkening, going black with desire. She had the sudden feeling that he might jerk her to him and kiss her hard, without ever saying a word.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to dance?\" she said softly. I\u0027m playing with fire, with something I don\u0027t understand, she thought suddenly. And in that instant she realized that she was frightened. Her heart began to pound violently. It was as if those green eyes spoke to some part of her that was buried deep beneath the surface-and that part was screaming \"danger\" at her. Some instinct older than civilization was telling her to run, to flee.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Awakening\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeptember 4\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Diary,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething awful is going to happen today.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know why I wrote that. It\u0027s crazy. There\u0027sno reason for me to be upset and every reason for me to be happy, but...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut here I am at 5:30 in the morning, awake and scared. I keep telling myself it\u0027s just that I\u0027m all messed up from the time difference between France and here. But that doesn\u0027t explain why I feel so scared. So lost.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day before yesterday, while Aunt Judith and Margaret and I were driving back from the airport, I had such a strange feeling. When we turned onto our street I suddenly thought, \"Mom and Dad are waiting for us at home. I bet they\u0027ll be on the front porch or in the living room looking out the window. They must have missed me so much.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. That sounds totally crazy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even when I saw the house and the empty front porch I still felt that way. I ran up the steps and I tried the door and knocked with the knocker. And when Aunt Judith unlocked the door I burst inside and just stood in the hallway listening, expecting to hear Mom coming down the stairs or Dad calling from the den.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Aunt Judith let a suitcase crash down on the floor behind me and sighed a huge sigh and said, \"We\u0027re home.\" And Margaret laughed. And the most horrible feeling I\u0027ve ever felt in my life came over me. I\u0027ve never felt so utterly and completely lost.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome. I\u0027m home. Why does that sound like a he?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was born here in Fell\u0027s Church. I\u0027ve always lived in this house, always. This is my same old bedroom, with the scorch mark on the floorboards where Caroline and I tried to sneak cigarettes in 5th grade and nearly choked ourselves. I can look out the window and see the big quince tree Matt and the guys climbed up to crash my birthday slumber party two years ago. This is my bed, my chair, my dresser.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now everything looks strange to me, as if I don\u0027t belong here. It\u0027s me that\u0027s out of place. And the worst thing is that I feel there\u0027s somewhere I do belong, but I just can\u0027t find it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too tired yesterday to go to Orientation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith picked up my schedule for me, but I didn\u0027t feel like talking to her on the phone. Aunt Judith told everyone who called that I had jet lag and was sleeping, but she watched me at dinner with a funny look on her face.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to see the crowd today, though. We\u0027re supposed to meet in the parking lot before school. Is that why I\u0027m scared? Am I frightened of them?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena Gilbert stopped writing. She stared at the last line she had written and then shook her head, pen hovering over the small book with the blue velvet cover. Then, with a sudden gesture, she lifted her head and threw pen and book at the big bay window, where they bounced off harmlessly and landed on the upholstered window seat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all so completely ridiculous.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince when had she, Elena Gilbert, been scared of meeting people? Since when had she been scared of anything ? She stood up and angrily thrust her arms into a red silk kimono. She didn\u0027t even glance at the elaborate Victorian mirror above the cherrywood dresser; she knew what she\u0027d see. Elena Gilbert, cool and blond and slender, the fashion trendsetter, the high school senior, the girl every boy wanted and every girl wanted to be. Who just now had an unaccustomed scowl on her face and a pinch to her mouth.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot bath and some coffee and I\u0027ll calm down, she thought. The morning ritual of washing and dressing was soothing, and she dawdled over it, sorting through her new outfits from Paris. She finally chose a pale rose top and white linen shorts combo that made her look like a raspberry sundae. Good enough to eat, she thought, and the mirror showed a girl with a secret smile. Her earlier fears had melted away, forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena! Where are you? You\u0027re going to be late for school!\" The voice drifted faintly up from below.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena ran the brush one more time through silky hair and pulled it back with a deep rose ribbon. Then she grabbed her backpack and went down the stairs.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the kitchen, four-year-old Margaret was eating cereal at the kitchen table, and Aunt Judith was burning something on the stove. Aunt Judith was the sort of woman who always looked vaguely flustered; she had a thin, mild face and light flyaway hair pushed back untidily. Elena landed a peck on her cheek.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, everybody. Sorry I don\u0027t have time for breakfast.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Elena, you can\u0027t just go off without eating. You need your protein-\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get a doughnut before school,\" said Elena briskly. She dropped a kiss on Margaret\u0027s tow head and turned to go.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Elena-\" \"And I\u0027ll probably go home with Bonnie or Meredith after school, so don\u0027t wait dinner. Bye!\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena-\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was already at the front door. She closed it behind her, cutting off Aunt Judith\u0027s distant protests, and stepped out onto the front porch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stopped.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the bad feelings of the morning rushed over her again. The anxiety, the fear. And the certainty that something terrible was about to happen.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaple Street was deserted. The tall Victorian houses looked strange and silent, as if they might all be empty inside, like the houses on an abandoned movie set. They looked as if they were empty ofpeople , but full of strange watching things.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it; something was watching her. The sky overhead was not blue but milky and opaque, like a giant bowl turned upside down.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was stifling, and Elena felt sure that there were eyes on her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught sight of something dark in the branches of the old quince tree in front of the house.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crow, sitting as still as the yellow-tinged leaves around it. And it was the thing watching her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to tell herself that this was ridiculous, but somehow she knew . It was the biggest crow she had ever seen, plump and sleek, with rainbows shining in its black feathers. She could see every detail of it clearly: the greedy dark claws, the sharp beak, the single glittering black eye.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so motionless that it might have been a wax model of a bird sitting there. But as she stared at it, Elena felt herself flush slowly, heat coming in waves up her throat and cheeks. Because it was... looking at her. Looking the way boys looked at her when she wore a bathing suit or a sheer blouse. As if it were undressing her with its eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she realized what she was doing, she had dropped her backpack and picked up a stone from beside the driveway. \"Get out of here,\" she said, and heard the shaking anger in her own voice. \"Go on! Getaway !\" With the last word, she threw the stone.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an explosion of leaves, but the crow soared up unharmed. Its wings were huge, and they made enough racket for a whole flock of crows. Elena crouched, suddenly panicked as it flapped directly over her head, the wind of its wings ruffling her blond hair.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it swooped up again and circled, a black silhouette against the paper-white sky. Then, with one harsh croak, it wheeled away toward the woods.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena straightened up slowly, then glanced around, self-conscious. She couldn\u0027t believe what she had just done. But now that the bird was gone, the sky felt ordinary again. A little wind made the leaves flutter, and Elena took a deep breath. Down the street a door opened and several children poured out, laughing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at them, and took another breath, relief sweeping through her like sunlight. How could she have been so silly? This was a beautiful day, full of promise, and nothing bad was going to happen.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing bad was going to happen-except that she was going to be late getting to school. The whole crowd would be waiting for her in the parking lot.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could always tell everyone you stopped to throw stones at a Peeping Tom, she thought, and almost giggled. Now,that would give them something to think about.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a backward glance at the quince tree, she began to walk as quickly as she could down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crow crashed through the top of the massive oak, and Stefan\u0027s head jerked up reflexively. When he saw it was only a bird, he relaxed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes dropped to the limp white form in his hands, and he felt his face twist in regret. He hadn\u0027t meant to kill it. He would have hunted something larger than a rabbit if he\u0027d known how hungry he was. But, of course, that was the very thing that frightened him: never knowing how strong the hunger would be, or what he might have to do to satisfy it. He was lucky that this time he\u0027d killed only a rabbit.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood beneath the ancient oak trees, sunlight filtering down onto his curly hair. In jeans and T-shirt, Stefan Salvatore looked exactly like a normal high school student.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep in the woods, where no one would see him, he\u0027d come to feed. Now he licked at his gums and lips painstakingly, to make sure there was no stain on them. He didn\u0027t want to take any chances. This masquerade was going to be hard enough to pull off as it was.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he wondered, again, if he should just give it all up. Perhaps he should go back to Italy, back to his hiding place. What made him think that he could rejoin the world of daylight?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was tired of living in shadows. He was tired of the darkness, and of the things that lived in it. Most of all, he was tired of being alone.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t sure why he\u0027d chosen Fell\u0027s Church, Virginia. It was a young town, by his standards; the oldest buildings had been put up only a century and a half ago. But memories and ghosts of the Civil War still lived here, as real as the supermarkets and fast-food joints.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan appreciated respect for the past. He thought he might come to like the people of Fell\u0027s Church. And perhaps-just perhaps-he might find a place among them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never be accepted completely, of course. A bitter smile curved his lips at the idea. He knew better than to hope forthat . There would never be a place where he could belong completely, where he could truly be himself.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless he chose to belong to the shadows...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slapped the thought away. He\u0027d renounced the darkness; he\u0027d left the shadows behind him. He was blotting all those long years out and starting afresh, today.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan realized he was still holding the rabbit. Gently, he laid it down on the bed of brown oak leaves. Far away, too far for human ears to pick up, he recognized the noises of a fox.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome along, brother hunter, he thought sadly. Your breakfast is waiting.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he slung his jacket over his shoulder, he noticed the crow that had disturbed him earlier. It was still perched in the oak tree, and it seemed to be watching him. There was a wrongness about it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to send a probing thought toward it, to examine the bird, and stopped himself. Remember your promise, he thought. You don\u0027t use the Powers unless it is absolutely necessary. Not unless there is no other choice.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving almost silently among the dead leaves and dry twigs, he made his way toward the edge of the woods. His car was parked there. He glanced back, once, and saw that the crow had left the branches and dropped down on the rabbit.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something sinister in the way it spread its wings over the limp white body, something sinister and triumphant. Stefan\u0027s throat tightened, and he almost strode back to chase the bird away. Still, it had as much right to eat as the fox did, he told himself.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much right as he did.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he encountered the bird again, he\u0027d look into its mind, he decided. Just now, he tore his eyes from the sight of it and hurried on through the woods, jaw set. He didn\u0027t want to be late arriving at Robert E. Lee High School. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-awakening-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-1.html","bookId":2031,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:54 PM"}
