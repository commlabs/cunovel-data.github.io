What raving, lunatic idiot —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ben Adaephon Delat.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared, disbelieving, thunderstruck at his own stupidity. ‘That name …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘High Mage Quick Ben, Captain. He vowed he would save Burn, and that was one vow he would not surrender. He said the cancer needed cutting out – Ruthan? What is wrong?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had turned away, struggling to hold it all in. Struggling – and then failing. Laughter burst from him. Disbelieving, wondrous laughter. ‘Delat? Adaephon Delat? Quick Ben – oh, by the Abyss! The bloody nerve of him! Was it a glamour, that made me so thick? No wonder he stayed away from me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Captain?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, and he could feel his mouth stretched wide in a manic, helpless grin. ‘And down he went, in the battle with the Short-Tails? Like Hood he did!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips thinned into a straight line. ‘Captain Ruthan Gudd, even you could not be so dense. Of course he isn’t dead.’ She pointed to a nearby figure perched atop an outcrop of rock. ‘Ask our resident Septarch of D’rek. He will tell you, since he at last has figured it out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if commanded, Banaschar rose then, tottering as he walked to them. He wagged a finger at Ruthan Gudd, and through cracked, bleeding lips, he said, ‘This is Quick Ben’s game, O Elder. The bones are in his sweaty hands and they have been for some time. Now, if at his table you’ll find the Worm of Autumn, and the once Lord of Death, and Shadowthrone and Cotillion, not to mention the past players Anomander Rake and Dessembrae, and who knows who else, well – did you really believe a few thousand damned Nah’ruk could take him down? The thing about Adaephon Delat’s game is this : he cheats .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to the Adjunct and managed a faint bow. ‘Lady Tavore, it is fair to say that I will remember the light in your eyes – as I am privileged to see it now – for the rest of my days. Did I not speak of heroism? I believe I did, though in your despond perhaps you were not listening.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By your words, High Priest, I found the strength for the next step. Forgive me if I could give you nothing in return.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head and regarded her, and then said softly, ‘My lady, have you not given enough?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan Gudd clawed at his beard. The delight was fast fading, and he feared stirring the ashes and finding that hope had been nothing but a lone spark, already gone. ‘We still face a dilemma, and oh how I wish Delat was here, though I think even he would have no answers for our plight. This desert will have us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore said, ‘Captain, if I fall – take up my sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If I do, Adjunct – and if indeed a time comes when I must draw that weapon – it will kill me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then as you have said, you must not be an Elder God.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As I said,’ he agreed wryly. ‘But the matter is simpler than that. I have lived a long time, and that is by magic alone. Without sorcery, I would be less than dust.’ He glanced at Banaschar. ‘Delat is not the only one to have gamed at the table of the gods.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I would know your story some day, Ruthan Gudd,’ said Banaschar, with a sad smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan Gudd shrugged. ‘To be honest, too sordid to tell.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent, as if so thoroughly wrung out by all that had been said – and felt – that nothing remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara then returned, and at her side was the girl named Badalle, and a boy carrying a sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNom Kala walked through a silent camp, bodies lying motionless on all sides, half-closed eyes tracking her as she strode past. She saw suffering on a scale that made long-dead emotions tremble inside her, and she remembered the fate of her own kind, when walls of ice closed in, when the animals died out or went away, when there was nothing left to eat, when the humans hunted them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir answer had been the Ritual, an escape that proved a prison. But such a thing was not available to these mortals. Another day. A lie to give them that, if one is even possible. See how weak they are. See how they fail. Another day – but would that be a gift? The marching, the dragging steps, the ones falling to the side to surrender. Will they thank me for those extra moments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps her desire to help was in fact one of cruelty—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, how does it feel?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the faint voice she halted, looked round, saw a soldier sitting nearby, studying her. ‘How does what feel?’ she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Being … dust.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not know how to answer him and so was silent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-255.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
