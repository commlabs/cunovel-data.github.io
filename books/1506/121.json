He is the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his past life, Jeriet had been one seat above Artpe in the Demon King’s army. \u0026nbsp;It was fair to assume that he was probably the weakest now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was like Artpe. \u0026nbsp;His abilities weren’t focused solely on the martial aspects. \u0026nbsp;If the hero’s party had to fight a higher level opponent, he was probably the most fair opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I sense something was wrong with the pope, but I never expected him to be a Demon…..”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That bastard eats his chosen prey. \u0026nbsp;The consumption of his preys allows him to duplicate all the special characteristics of his preys. \u0026nbsp;He is able to transform into their form. \u0026nbsp;At some point, he took the place of the real pope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My god…..”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew their current situation was urgent, but Vadinet couldn’t help it. \u0026nbsp;She asked another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know all of this, Artpe-nim!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is the nature of my Innate ability. \u0026nbsp;You cannot hide anything from my eyes. \u0026nbsp;Like right now….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral Mana Strings extended from his hand, and the strands swiped at empty air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next moment, a part of the hallway naturally crumbled, and a staircase leading downward was revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My god….. \u0026nbsp; Your powers really gives me the chills. \u0026nbsp;As expected of hero-nim….!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Artpe….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVadinet’s eyes were full of love and admiration. \u0026nbsp;On the other hand, Maetel was somewhat used to his abilities, so she unsheathed her sword as she asked him a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a way we can win against a level 340 enemy? \u0026nbsp;We were able to win against the Kraken and the Ancient Kraken thanks to extremely favorable circumstances. \u0026nbsp;The current situation…..”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It really is the perfect situation for us. \u0026nbsp;You don’t know this yet, but there is a reason why Demons don’t directly confront a hero in the human realm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaetel tilted her head in confusion, but Artpe wasn’t the one to explain the situation. \u0026nbsp;The explanation was given by none other than the holy priestess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Demon’s ability is weakened in the human realm. \u0026nbsp;There is also a difference in Mana depending on the realm. \u0026nbsp;Demons are weakened up to a certain point here, and they aren’t able to manifest their power given to them by their level.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to speak as the party descended the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m embarrassed to say this, but…... \u0026nbsp;It is possible to weaken them further with the power I possess. \u0026nbsp;It is the significance of being a holy priestess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As their first act, this was why the Demon King’s army decided to render the temple powerless. \u0026nbsp;It is also why one of the Four Heavenly King transformed into the pope to infiltrate this place. \u0026nbsp;He did it despite knowing the danger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, the plan had been very successful in his previous life. \u0026nbsp;A Four Heavenly King died in that venture, but he had expertly razed the temple to the ground. \u0026nbsp;The holy priestess’ tragic end was just a bonus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, even if I’m capable of weakening them, I’m merely a holy priestess with no battle capabilities. \u0026nbsp;That is why I acted ignorant until Artpe-nim arrived. \u0026nbsp;I had no choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The fact that you became aware of their intentions is amazing in itself. \u0026nbsp;Even a normal hero won’t be able to see through that bastard’s transformation ability.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for their enemies, Artpe and Maetel weren’t normal heroes. \u0026nbsp;It was as if they were heroes that had experienced killing a Demon King before. \u0026nbsp;On the other hand, Vadinet was only a holy priestess. \u0026nbsp;It was quite the feat that she was able to notice the seditious energy crawling through the inner temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess we are just going to rush him. \u0026nbsp;He is level 340, but he is weakened since he is in the human realm. \u0026nbsp;If this woman casts an additional weakening spell….. \u0026nbsp;Yes, I think it’ll be possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, the biggest variable that could sway the outcome of this situation is the magic circle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had used the magic circle in her past life to transmogrify herself into a Demon. \u0026nbsp;As expected, the holy priestess made an astute observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said the Demon has a transformation ability, and he ate the pope. \u0026nbsp;In turn, this gives him everything possessed by the pope, so he probably gained the ability to use the magic circle…. \u0026nbsp;
