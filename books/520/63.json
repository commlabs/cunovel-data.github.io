{"id":44729,"no":63,"title":"March Fifth","content":"Dear Mr. Trustee,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month--a weary day for the\n\u003cbr\u003e John Grier Home. How relieved they\u0027ll be when five o\u0027clock comes\n\u003cbr\u003e and you pat them on the head and take yourselves off! Did you\n\u003cbr\u003e (individually) ever pat me on the head, Daddy? I don\u0027t believe so--\n\u003cbr\u003e my memory seems to be concerned only with fat Trustees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Give the Home my love, please--my TRULY love. I have quite a feeling\n\u003cbr\u003e of tenderness for it as I look back through a haze of four years. \n\u003cbr\u003e When I first came to college I felt quite resentful because I\u0027d\n\u003cbr\u003e been robbed of the normal kind of childhood that the other girls\n\u003cbr\u003e had had; but now, I don\u0027t feel that way in the least. I regard it\n\u003cbr\u003e as a very unusual adventure. It gives me a sort of vantage point\n\u003cbr\u003e from which to stand aside and look at life. Emerging full grown,\n\u003cbr\u003e I get a perspective on the world, that other people who have been\n\u003cbr\u003e brought up in the thick of things entirely lack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they\n\u003cbr\u003e are happy. They are so accustomed to the feeling that their senses\n\u003cbr\u003e are deadened to it; but as for me--I am perfectly sure every moment\n\u003cbr\u003e of my life that I am happy. And I\u0027m going to keep on being,\n\u003cbr\u003e no matter what unpleasant things turn up. I\u0027m going to regard them\n\u003cbr\u003e (even toothaches) as interesting experiences, and be glad to know what\n\u003cbr\u003e they feel like. `Whatever sky\u0027s above me, I\u0027ve a heart for any fate.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However, Daddy, don\u0027t take this new affection for the J.G.H.\n\u003cbr\u003e too literally. If I have five children, like Rousseau, I shan\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e leave them on the steps of a foundling asylum in order to insure\n\u003cbr\u003e their being brought up simply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Give my kindest regards to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful;\n\u003cbr\u003e love would be a little strong) and don\u0027t forget to tell her what a\n\u003cbr\u003e beautiful nature I\u0027ve developed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59785.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
