I told you I was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nose wrinkled. “I know, but—” Taylor’s voice broke off. “Never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Taylor was waiting for things to go back to normal again, to be like before. But they could never be like before. I was never going to be like before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to believe. I used to think that if I wanted it bad enough, wished hard enough, everything would work out the way it was supposed to. Destiny, like Susannah said. I wished for Conrad on every birthday, every shooting star, every lost eyelash, every penny in a fountain was dedicated to the one I loved. I thought it would always be that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor wanted me to forget about Conrad, to just erase him from my mind and memory. She kept saying things like, “Everybody has to get over a first love, it’s a rite of passage.” But Conrad wasn’t just my first love. He wasn’t some rite of passage. He was so much more than that. He and Jeremiah and Susannah were my family. In my memory, the three of them would always be entwined, forever linked. There couldn’t be one without the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I forgot Conrad, if I evicted him from my heart, pretended like he was never there, it would be like doing those things to Susannah. And that, I couldn’t do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt used to be that the week school let out in June, we’d pack up the car and head straight to Cousins. My mother would go to Costco the day before and buy jugs of apple juice and economy-size boxes of granola bars, sunscreen, and whole grain cereal. When I begged for Lucky Charms or Cap’n Crunch, my mother would say, “Beck will have plenty of cereal that’ll rot your teeth out, don’t you worry.” Of course she’d be right. Susannah—Beck to my mother—loved her kid cereal, just like me. We went through a lot of cereal at the summer house. It never even had a chance to go stale. There was one summer when the boys ate cereal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My brother, Steven, was Frosted Flakes, Jeremiah was Cap’n Crunch, and Conrad was Corn Pops. Jeremiah and Conrad were Beck’s boys, and they loved their cereal. Me, I ate whatever was left over with sugar on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been going to Cousins my whole life. We’d never skipped a summer, not once. Almost seventeen years of me playing catch-up to the boys, of hoping and wishing that one day I would be old enough to be a part of their crew. The summer boys crew. I finally made it, and now it was too late. In the pool, on the last night of the last summer, we said we’d always come back. It’s scary how easy promises were broken. Just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home last summer, I waited. August turned into September, school started, and still I waited. It wasn’t like Conrad and I had made any declarations. It wasn’t like he was my boyfriend. All we’d done was kiss. He was going to college, where there would be a million other girls. Girls without curfews, girls on his hall, all smarter and prettier than me, all mysterious and brand-new in a way that I could never be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about him constantly—what it all meant, what we were to each other now. Because we couldn’t go back. I knew I couldn’t. What happened between us—between me and Conrad, between me and Jeremiah—it changed everything. And so when August and September began and still the phone didn’t ring, all I had to do was think back to the way he’d looked at me that last night, and I knew there was still hope. I knew that I hadn’t imagined it all. I couldn’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to my mother, Conrad was all moved into his dorm room, he had an annoying roommate from New Jersey, and Susannah worried he wasn’t getting enough to eat. My mother told me these things casually, offhandedly, so as not to injure my pride. I never pressed her for more information. The thing is, I knew he’d call. I knew it. All I had to do was wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call came the second week of September, three weeks since the last time I’d seen him. I was eating strawberry ice cream in the living room, and Steven and I were fighting over the remote control. It was a Monday night, nine p.m., prime TV-watching time. The phone rang, and neither Steven nor I made a move to grab it. Whoever got up would lose the battle for the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother picked it up in her office. She brought the phone into the living room and she said, “Belly, it’s for you. It’s Conrad.” Then she winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in me went abuzz. I could hear the ocean in my ears. The rush, the roar in my eardrums. It was like a high. It was golden. I had waited, and this was my reward! Being right, being patient, never felt so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven was the one to break me out of my reverie. Frowning, he said, “Why would Conrad be calling you ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored him and took the phone from my mother. I walked away from Steven, from the remote, from my melting dish of ice cream. None of it mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made Conrad wait until I was on the staircase before I said anything. I sat down on the steps and I said, “Hey.” I tried to keep the smile off my face; I knew he would hear it over the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said. “What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So guess what,” he said. “My roommate snores even louder than you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called again the next night, and the night after. We talked for hours at a time. When the phone rang, and it was for me and not Steven, he’d been confused at first. “Why does Conrad keep calling you?” he’d demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you think? He likes me. We like each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven had nearly gagged. “He’s lost his mind,” he said, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it so impossible that Conrad Fisher would like me?” I asked him, crossing my arms defiantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t even have to think about his answer. “Yes,” he said. “It is so impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd honestly, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a dream. Unreal. After all that pining and longing and wishing, years and years of it, whole summers’ worth, he was calling me . He liked talking to me. I made him laugh even when he didn’t want to. I understood what he was going through, because I was sort of going through it too. There were only a few people in the world who loved Susannah the way we did. I thought that would be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe became something. Something that was never exactly defined, but it was something. It was really something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few times, he drove the three and a half hours from school to my house. Once, he spent the night because it got so late my mother didn’t want him to drive back. Conrad stayed in the guest room, and I lay in my bed awake for hours, thinking about how he was asleep just a few feet away, in my house of all places. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-2.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
