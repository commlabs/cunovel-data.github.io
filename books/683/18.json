{"id":36844,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII—A BUSINESS TRANSACTION","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out for a stroll; she knew it would be no use trying to get rest before dinner. \u0026nbsp;That ordeal, too, had to be gone through. \u0026nbsp;She found herself unconsciously going in the direction of the grove; but when she became aware of it a great revulsion overcame her, and she shuddered. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Slowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finely-kept grass which lay on the side of the house away from the wood. \u0026nbsp;The green sward lay like a sea, dotted with huge trees, singly, or in clumps as islands. \u0026nbsp;In its far-stretching stateliness there was something soothing. \u0026nbsp;She came back to the sound of the dressing-gong with a better strength to resist the trial before her. \u0026nbsp;Well she knew her aunt would have something to say on the subject of her interference in Leonard Everard’s affairs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her fears were justified, for when they had come into the drawing-room after dinner Miss Rowly began:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Stephen dear, is it not unwise of you to interfere in Mr. Everard’s affairs?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Why unwise, Auntie?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well, my dear, the world is censorious. \u0026nbsp;And when a young lady, of your position and your wealth, takes a part in a young man’s affairs tongues are apt to wag. \u0026nbsp;And also, dear, debts, young men’s debts, are hardly the subjects for a girl’s investigation. \u0026nbsp;Remember, that we ladies live very different lives from men; from some men, I should say, for your dear father was the best of men, and I should think that in all his life there was nothing which he would have wished concealed. \u0026nbsp;But, my dear, young men are less restrained in their ways than we are, than we have to be for our own safety and protection.’ \u0026nbsp;The poor lady was greatly perturbed at having to speak in such a way. \u0026nbsp;Stephen saw her distress; coming over to her, she sat down and took her hand. \u0026nbsp;Stephen had a very tender side to her nature, and she loved very truly the dear old lady who had taken her mother’s place and had shown her all a mother’s love. \u0026nbsp;Now, in her loneliness and woe and fear, she clung to her in spirit. \u0026nbsp;She would have liked to have clung to her physically; to have laid her head on her bosom, and have cried her heart out. \u0026nbsp;The time for tears had not come. \u0026nbsp;Hourly she felt more and more the weight that a shameful secret is to carry. \u0026nbsp;She knew, however, that she could set her aunt’s mind at rest on the present subject; so she said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I think you are right, Auntie dear. \u0026nbsp;It would have been better if I had asked you first; but I saw that Leonard was in distress, and wormed the cause of it from him. \u0026nbsp;When I heard that it was only debt I offered to help him. \u0026nbsp;He is an old friend, you know, Auntie. \u0026nbsp;We were children together; and as I have much more money than I can ever want or spend, I thought I might help him. \u0026nbsp;I am afraid I have let myself in for a bigger thing than I intended; but as I have promised I must go on with it. \u0026nbsp;I dare say, Auntie, that you are afraid that I may end by getting in love with him, and marrying him. \u0026nbsp;Don’t you, dear?’ \u0026nbsp;This was said with a hug and a kiss which gave the old lady delight. \u0026nbsp;Her instinct told her what was coming. \u0026nbsp;She nodded her head in acquiescence. \u0026nbsp;Stephen went on gravely:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Put any such fear out of your mind. \u0026nbsp;I shall never marry him. \u0026nbsp;I can never love him.’ \u0026nbsp;She was going to say ‘could never love him,’ when she remembered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Are you sure, my dear? \u0026nbsp;The heart is not always under one’s own control.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Quite sure, Auntie. \u0026nbsp;I know Leonard Everard; and though I have always liked him, I do not respect him. \u0026nbsp;Why, the very fact of his coming to me for money would make me reconsider any view I had formed, had nothing else ever done so. \u0026nbsp;You may take it, Auntie dear, that in the way you mean Leonard is nothing to me; can never be anything to me!’ \u0026nbsp;Here a sudden inspiration took her. \u0026nbsp;In its light a serious difficulty passed, and the doing of a thing which had a fear of its own became easy. \u0026nbsp;With a conviction in her tone, which in itself aided her immediate purpose, she said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I shall prove it to you. \u0026nbsp;That is, if you will not mind doing something which will save me an embarrassment.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘You know I will do anything, my dearest, which an old woman can do for a young one!’ \u0026nbsp;Stephen squeezed the mittened hand which she held as she went on:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘As I said, I have promised to lend him some money. \u0026nbsp;The first instalment is to be given him to-morrow; he is to call for it in the afternoon. \u0026nbsp;Will you give it to him for me?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Gladly, my dear,’ said the old lady, much relieved. \u0026nbsp;Stephen continued:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘One other thing, Auntie, I want you to do for me: not to think of the amount, or to say a word to me about it. \u0026nbsp;It is a large sum, and I dare say it will frighten you a little. \u0026nbsp;But I have made up my mind to it. \u0026nbsp;I am learning a great deal out of this, Auntie dear; and I am quite willing to pay for my knowledge. \u0026nbsp;After all, money is the easiest and cheapest way of paying for knowledge! \u0026nbsp;Don’t you agree with me?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Rowly gulped down her disappointment. \u0026nbsp;She felt that she ought not to say too much, now that Stephen had set aside her graver fears. \u0026nbsp;She consoled herself with the thought that even a large amount of money would cause no inconvenience to so wealthy a woman as Stephen. \u0026nbsp;Beyond this, as she would have the handing over of the money to Leonard, she would know the amount. \u0026nbsp;If advisable, she could remonstrate. \u0026nbsp;She could if necessary consult, in confidence, with Harold. \u0026nbsp;Her relief from her greater fear, and her gladness at this new proof of her niece’s confidence, were manifested in the extra affection with which she bade her good-night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite alone; and as she lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought before sleep came.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate danger was swerving from her. \u0026nbsp;Things were so shaping themselves that she need not have any fear concerning Leonard. \u0026nbsp;For his own sake he would have to keep silent. \u0026nbsp;If he intended to blackmail her she would have the protection of her aunt’s knowledge of the loan, and of her participation in it. \u0026nbsp;The only weapon that remained to him was her letter; and that she would get from him before furnishing the money for the payment of his other debts.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These things out of the way, her thoughts turned to the matter of the greater dread; that of which all along she had feared to think for a moment: Harold!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold! and her treatment of him!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The first reception of the idea was positive anguish. \u0026nbsp;From the moment he had left her till now there had been no time when a consideration of the matter was possible. \u0026nbsp;Time pressed, or circumstances had interfered, or her own personal condition had forbidden. \u0026nbsp;Now, when she was alone, the whole awful truth burst on her like an avalanche. \u0026nbsp;Stephen felt the issue of her thinking before the thinking itself was accomplished; and it was with a smothered groan that she, in the darkness, held up her arms with fingers linked in desperate concentration of appeal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Oh, if she could only take back one hour of her life, well she knew what that hour would be! \u0026nbsp;Even that shameful time with Leonard on the hill-top seemed innocuous beside the degrading remembrance of her conduct to the noble friend of her whole life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sadly she turned over in her bed, and with shut eyes put her burning face on the pillow, to hide, as it were, from herself her abject depth of shame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he could. \u0026nbsp;At four o’clock he was at the door of Normanstand in his dogcart. \u0026nbsp;This time he had a groom with him and a suitcase packed for a night’s use, as he was to go on to London after his interview with Stephen. \u0026nbsp;He had lost sight altogether of the matter of Stephen’s letter, or else he would have been more nervous.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was taken into the blue drawing-room, where shortly Miss Rowly joined him. \u0026nbsp;He had not expected this. \u0026nbsp;His mental uneasiness manifested itself in his manner, and his fidgeting was not unobserved by the astute old lady. \u0026nbsp;He was disconcerted; ‘overwhelmed’ would better have described his feelings when she said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Miss Norman is sorry she can’t see you to-day as she is making a visit; but she has given me a message for you, or rather a commission to discharge. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps you had better sit down at the table; there are writing materials there, and I shall want a receipt of some sort.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Stephen did not say anything about a receipt!’ \u0026nbsp;The other smiled sweetly as she said in a calm way:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘But unfortunately Miss Norman is not here; and so I have to do the best I can. \u0026nbsp;I really must have some proof that I have fulfilled my trust. \u0026nbsp;You see, Mr. Everard, though it is what lawyers call a “friendly” transaction, it is more or less a business act; and I must protect myself.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leonard saw that he must comply, for time pressed. \u0026nbsp;He sat down at the table. \u0026nbsp;Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him, he said with what command of his voice he could:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What am I to write?’ \u0026nbsp;The old lady took from her basket a folded sheet of notepaper, and, putting on her reading-glasses, said as she smoothed it out:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I think it would be well to say something like this—“I, Leonard Everard, of Brindehow, in the Parish of Normanstand, in the County of Norcester, hereby acknowledge the receipt from Miss Laetitia Rowly of nine hundred pounds sterling lent to me in accordance with my request, the same being to clear me of a pressing debt due by me.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he had finished writing the receipt Miss Rowly looked it over, and handing it back to him, said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Now sign;

turning back he said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘May I ask if Stephen said anything about getting the document?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I beg your pardon,’ she said icily, ‘did you speak of any one?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Miss Norman, I meant!’ \u0026nbsp;Miss Rowly’s answer to this came so smartly that it left an added sting. \u0026nbsp;Her arrow was fledged with two feathers so that it must shoot true: her distrust of him and his own impotence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Oh no! \u0026nbsp;Miss Norman knows nothing of this. \u0026nbsp;She simply asked me to give you the money. \u0026nbsp;This is my own doing entirely. \u0026nbsp;You see, I must exercise my judgment on my dear niece’s behalf. \u0026nbsp;Of course it may not be necessary to show her the receipt;
