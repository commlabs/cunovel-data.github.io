{"id":13497,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. AFFAIRS IN WATERFORD.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Leaving Dean in Denver, let us go back to Waterford, and see how matters stood in that quiet little village. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With Adin Dunham they did not go well. He had an attack of rheumatism during the winter which hindered him from working for several weeks, and so abridged his earnings. Both he and his wife missed Dean, whose lively and cheerful temperament enlivened the house. They were troubled too because months had passed since they had heard from him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know what has happened to Dean,\" said Adin one Saturday evening, when he sat beside the kitchen fire with his wife. \"Seems to me he\u0027d write if he was in good health. I am afeared something has gone wrong with the boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 248\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope not, father,\" said Sarah Dunham, pausing in her knitting.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So do I, Sarah, but you must agree that it\u0027s strange he don\u0027t write.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s true, Adin. He was always a thoughtful, considerate boy. The house seems lonesome without him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it does, Sarah. But if I only knew he was doin\u0027 well I wouldn\u0027t mind that. He may have got sick and——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t say such things, father,\" said Mrs. Dunham in a tremulous voice. \"I can\u0027t bear to think anything\u0027s happened to the boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But we must be prepared for the worst, if so be the worst has come.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sure he is alive and well,\" said Sarah Dunham, who was of a more hopeful temperament than her husband.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then why don\u0027t he write?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To be sure, Adin. That\u0027s something I can\u0027t explain. But Dean\u0027s healthy, and he\u0027s a good boy, who wouldn\u0027t be likely to get into mischief. Instead of being prepared for the worst, suppose we hope for the best.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Maybe you\u0027re right, Sarah. I try to be cheerful, but since I was robbed of that thousand dollars luck seems to have been against me. And the worst of it249 is Sarah, I\u0027m not getting younger. I shall be sixty-five next month.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m not much behind you, Adin, as far as years go.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did hope that Dean would be in a position to help me when I got along in years. I mistrust I made a mistake when I let him go out West. If he\u0027d stayed here, he might have been a good deal of help to us both.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Still there didn\u0027t seem to be much of a prospect for the boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He could have managed the farm when he got a little older.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is true, but it has never given you a living, Adin. You\u0027ve had to depend upon your trade.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He could have learned the same trade. A trade\u0027s a good thing for a boy to have to fall back upon.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He may come back, and realize all your expectations, Adin. We mustn\u0027t despond till we have reason to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s another thing that\u0027s worryin\u0027 me, Sarah—it\u0027s the mortgage. Next week six months\u0027 interest falls due—twenty-four dollars—and I haven\u0027t the money to meet it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Squire Bates won\u0027t push you, surely.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. Once or twice lately when I met the squire he dropped a hint that he was short of250 money. I didn\u0027t say much, but it struck me he had an object in sayin\u0027 what he did.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s the first time you haven\u0027t been ready with the interest, isn\u0027t it, Adin?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, the very first time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then perhaps he will overlook it this time. You\u0027d better manage to see him about it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll do it the first time I see him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That time came sooner than either of them thought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Adin Dunham had scarcely completed his sentence when a knock was heard at the door (Adin had never so far fallen in with city customs as to introduce a door bell.)\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Dunham rose and opened the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-evening, Mrs. Dunham,\" said the visitor, suavely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-evening, Squire Bates,\" said Sarah in surprise. \"Won\u0027t you walk in?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, thank you. Is your husband at home?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, he never goes out in the evening. Adin,\" she said, preceding the visitor, \"here is Squire Bates, who has called to see you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am glad to see you, squire,\" said the carpenter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Take a chair, and excuse my gettin\u0027 up. My old enemy, the rheumatism, has got hold of me, and I\u0027m too stiff to move easy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 251\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, you are quite excusable, Mr. Dunham. I am sorry to hear that you are so afflicted.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t altogether comfortable. Besides, it puts me behindhand. I\u0027ve lost at least four weeks this winter from these rheumatic pains.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, indeed!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, and as you can imagine, that is a serious thing to a poor man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose so,\" assented the squire, coughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am glad you came in, squire, because I wanted to speak to you about the interest on that mortgage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It falls due next week,\" said Squire Bates, promptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just so, and I am sorry to say that for the first time I shall be unable to meet it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed!\" returned the squire, his voice stiffening. \"That is very unfortunate!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it is, squire, but I hope, as it is the first time, you will overlook it,\" said Adin Dunham, anxiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My dear sir,\" said the squire, \"it is hardly necessary to say that I truly sympathize with you. You believe that, I hope?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I thought you would squire. I didn\u0027t believe you\u0027d be hard on me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But—you misunderstand me a little, neighbor Dunham—I cannot be as considerate as I would like252 to be. The fact is, I am very short of money, embarrassed in fact, and I depended on that payment. Perhaps you can borrow it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s no one in the village likely to accommodate me with a loan unless it\u0027s you, squire.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I am very short of cash. Indeed it would hardly do for me to lend you money to pay me, would it now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid not,\" said the carpenter, ruefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In fact, neighbor Dunham, I came here this evening to ask if you couldn\u0027t arrange to pay the mortgage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pay the mortgage!\" echoed Adin Dunham, with a blank look.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; I thought you might raise the money in some way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you\u0027d tell me where, Squire Bates. Eight hundred dollars! Why it\u0027s as big to me as the national debt! I did expect to pay off the mortgage with that thousand dollars, that I was so wickedly robbed of.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, ah, to be sure! It was a great pity that you were prevented from doing it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That robbery broke me down, Squire Bates. I believe it has made me five years older, though it happened less than a year ago. It makes me feel kind of rebellious at times to think that such a villain253 as the man that robbed me should go unpunished.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t best to cry over spilt milk,\" said the squire who felt obviously uncomfortable under these allusions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t help thinkin\u0027 of it though, squire.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To be sure, to be sure!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When it was gone, I hoped that Dean would be able to help me to pay up the mortgage some time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you heard from your nephew lately?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not for months. Have you heard from the man he went out with?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I have heard several times.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Does he say anything about Dean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He says—but perhaps I had better not tell you. I don\u0027t want to distress you,\" and the squire hesitated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say what you have to say. I can stand it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He says he discharged Dean for dishonesty.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean dishonest! Why, squire, you must be jokin\u0027.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry to say, neighbor Dunham, that there is no joke about it. Mr. Kirby is not likely to be mistaken.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I tell you, Squire Bates,\" said Adin Dunham angrily, \"that my nephew Dean is as honest as I am myself. The man that charges him with dishonesty254 is a liar! It\u0027s a word I don\u0027t often use, but I must use it this time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I agree with my husband,\" said Sarah Dunham, her mild blue eye sparkling with indignation. \"Nothing would induce Dean to steal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course you are prejudiced in your nephew\u0027s favor,\" said the squire with a slight sneer. \"It is very natural, but you can\u0027t expect others to agree with you. However, we will drop this subject. I am afraid Dean will never be able to help you. I used to think well of him, though my son Brandon didn\u0027t agree with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What can your son Brandon know of Dean compared with mother and me, who have known the boy since his birth?\" the carpenter rejoined warmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I won\u0027t argue the question, neighbor Dunham. Indeed I feel for you in your disappointment. But to come back to business. You mustn\u0027t blame me if I foreclose the mortgage, as the law gives me a right to do. I wouldn\u0027t do it, I assure you, if circumstances did not make it imperative.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Foreclose the mortgage!\" repeated Adin in consternation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, or I\u0027ll give you eight hundred dollars for the place over and above the mortgage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only eight hundred dollars! Why, that would be robbery!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 255\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Think it over, neighbor Dunham, and don\u0027t decide hastily. You\u0027ll think differently, I am sure, when you have had time to consider it. I must bid you good-evening now, as I am in haste,\" and the squire rose quickly, and left the room, followed to the door mechanically and in silence by Sarah Dunham.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sarah,\" said the carpenter with grief-stricken countenance, \"this is worse than all. It looks as if we were indeed forsaken by Providence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hush, Adin! That is wicked. It looks hard, but the Lord may yet give us deliverance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid we shall end our days in the poorhouse, Sarah,\" said the husband gloomily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It won\u0027t be this year or next, Adin. Eight hundred dollars will support us for two years, and then there is your work besides. Let us look on the bright side!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But that was not easy for either of them. It seemed to Adin Dunham that his cup of bitterness was full.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81501.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:57 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:57 AM"}
