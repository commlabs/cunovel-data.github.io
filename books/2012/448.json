They struck in a manic frenzy, driving the Kolansii back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw a huge soldier collide with the heavies who had swung round the ice-bound man, somehow knocking three of them to the ground. His short sword lashed down, seemingly little more than touching each Kolansii on the side of the neck – and from three throats blood sprayed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Surround them!’ screamed Trissin from three ranks behind the fighting. ‘Cut them—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ball of flames engulfed the Kolansii commander, raging wild, and from the cloudless sky above lightning crashed down, the impact thundering, flinging soldiers to the ground, the strike creating a vast hole in the ranks. Burnt flesh and parts of bodies rained down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree demons clawed up from the ground beneath the burning woman, their bodies covered in protruding mouths filled with dagger-length fangs, the talons on the ends of their fingers long as sabres, their heads swarming with coal-red eyes. Roaring, they lunged into the raging flames, tearing the commander to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing all this, Grid Ffan shot a wild look back at his mages – saw them convulsed with laughter. Fucking illusionists! ‘Tone it down, you fools! You want t’give it all away?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGill Slime and Asp Slither looked up, suddenly straight-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Got anything else?’ Ffan demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth shook their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then get up here and fight!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kolansii had recovered, were now pushing to close once again. And more were swinging round on the far side, forcing Sample and Hare Ravage to back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing, Ffan worked up close to the Adjunct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir! We need to fall back into the phalanx! Adjunct!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she did not reply – or even seem to hear him – he cursed and said to the sergeant beside him, ‘Grey, listen. We come up and around her, either side – we make us a wall so she can’t get past us. Shipwreck, go there – and you, Semk, right here – we’re going to force her back and into the ranks, understood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the battle lust, sir!’ shouted Shipwreck, staggering drunkenly as was his way in moments of high excitement, when his damaged inner ear started acting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know what the fuck it is, idiot. Now, let’s do this!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil was being pulled away from the Adjunct’s flank – Henar Vygulf was hard pressed, now defending himself from attackers on two sides. The sudden arrival of the regulars had eased the threat, but only momentarily – there were simply too many of the bastards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobbing, bearing countless wounds, Lostara Yil drew closer to her love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t die. Please. Don’t die .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sword blade clipped Henar’s head. He staggered, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara screamed, now fighting blind to the threats pressing in around her, her gaze fixed on Henar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two regulars collapsed in to fend off the blows rushing down towards Henar. A woman and a man, the former Nathii, the latter Seven Cities – she had never seen them before, but they fought the attackers to a standstill above her love, who’d dragged off his cracked helm, blood gushing down from a scalp wound, and was trying to regain his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara hacked down a Kolansii on her left, leapt over his crumpling form. The grace was gone now. Only brutal savagery remained. She opened another man’s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nathii woman shrieked, a sword driven through her chest. Dropping her weapon she took hold of the arm gripping that sword, and pulled her attacker down as she fell. Her companion’s short sword licked out, cut through half his neck; the man was shouting, trying to drag Henar back to his feet, until an axe crushed the back of the regular’s head, through helm and bone, and flung him forward, limbs flopping. But Henar was on his feet once more – and Lostara reached his side. Just beyond, a row of faces: Malazan regulars, shouting from their line on the flank, screaming and beckoning. Close! Hurry! Come to us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara spun round, blades whipping out. ‘Henar! To the ranks! Go!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the other regulars spilling back, all of them arrayed protectively round the Adjunct as they forced her towards the ranks. Ruthan Gudd and one huge regular were fighting to prevent the group from getting cut off, enveloped, but even they were being pushed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake me, Cotillion! Please, I beg you! Take me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from her patron god … nothing. She twisted to her left, marched ahead to hold the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen Kolansii rushed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Khundryl had pushed as deep as they could into the press of heavy infantry. They had gone farther than Warleader Gall had thought possible. But now the horses were all dead, and so too the last of his warriors. But the advance had been blocked – bodies alone were enough to prevent the enemy from swinging round the Malazan wing – so now they were simply pushing inward, forcing the regulars into an ever-contracting formation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-448.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
