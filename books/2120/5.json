It was the seventh one today. Could everyone please calm down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, in less than twenty-four hours, the news that the fabulous Mimi Force was planning an after-party to the Four Hundred Ball had gone out to the entire New York City teen vampire elite. Of course, Mimi herself had told Piper Crandall, the biggest gossip in the school, and Piper had made sure everyone knew exactly what was going down. There was a secret location. The Force twins were hosting. But no one would know if they were invited until the night of the event. Sheer social torture!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust say Y or N!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe deleted the text without replying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi walked down the back staircase at Duchesne that led to the cafeteria in the basement.

Mimi was supposed to meet her for lunch, and she was late as usual. Bliss was glad of the reprieve, since it gave her a chance to lose herself in the events of the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan. It had to be him. The stranger in the park who had saved her from drowning. Bliss had to believe he had survived the Silver Blood attack. Perhaps he was now in hiding, and maybe he would be in danger if he revealed his identity. Like a superhero, she thought dreamily. Who else would have sensed her distress? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-5.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
