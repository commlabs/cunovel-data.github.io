However, his instinct told him that this wasn’t right, because this explanation was far too forced in too many places. For instance, how could the ancient race Sheng Mei have reincarnated into an abyssal?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Lin Ming looked upon Sheng Mei’s projection, he was left in a daze.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnd this daze was naturally seen by the several Elders of the Ancient Eon Sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA young abyssal Elder’s eyes flashed with obvious disdain.

In truth, abyssal demons had an extremely strange aesthetic sense. Not only did they accept the majestic and fierce abyssal women, but they even accepted the gentle and beautiful women like those of the ancient races or succubus demons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSheng Mei certainly belonged to the latter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s useless no matter how much he stares. He’s nothing but a toad wanting to eat swan meat. The Great Elder is indeed wise. This fellow didn’t even know that Deep hasn’t appeared for billions of years. It seems he has no understanding of totem level influences so he naturally wouldn’t know that Deep King Road’s Holy Demoness is colder than a hundred million year old glacier and even higher and loftier than the stars in the skies. When she suggested that she would only marry someone who could exceed her in strength at the same cultivation level, she was simply digging a pit so everyone could jump in. She just wanted all those higher abyssals who wished to win her over to lose all heart at doing so.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“There simply isn’t anyone capable of defeating her at the same boundary. Moreover… everyone knows the rules. Those that wish to defeat her, touch her, dual cultivate with her, all those higher abyssals that tried have been severely wounded by her, and some of them were nearly crippled! However, because Deep King Road is so strong no one dares to say anything. After all, those upper abyssals originally all thought that the Holy Demoness was just a woman so she would be easy to deal with.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Hahaha! That’s right. The reason that Holy Demoness was so ruthless in her actions was because she wanted to inform all the other higher abyssals not to bother with her unless they wanted to suffer the same fate! Now, it’s already been 300-500 years since anyone has dared to have designs on Deep King Road’s Holy Demoness. The Great Elder is truly killing someone without whetting his blade with a single drop of blood!
