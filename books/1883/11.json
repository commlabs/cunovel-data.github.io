Geraldine whined, clutched her face and scuttled back, blood pouring through her long-nailed fingers, pattering to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s tactless, but accurate. Calling me a plump herbivore is not. Also,\" she added, glancing down at him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not speaking to you. But I will save your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—get—out—of—here—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shut up. And you,\" she said to Geraldine, stalking toward her, \"are a nasty, smelly, wretched creature. Look at you. You look like you\u0027re going to Change any second. Feeling the stress of the coming full moon, Geraldine? How rude of you to show it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re surprised by how I look,\" Geraldine hissed back, flipping to her feet. \"That\u0027s because you never saw me. No one has ever! Seen! Me! Not your precious Michael or his bitch-dog or Derik or Mother or—my—my—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care, Geraldine. It\u0027s too bad you had an unendurable childhood, but what gives you the right to kill? Worse, kill helpless humans? Nothing. Those women did nothing to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared watched the two women circle each other. They moved strangely—more like big cats than an accountant and a cemetery caretaker. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. Everything hurt, his throat was on fire and he was seeing two Moiras and two Geraldines, but he still couldn\u0027t look away. He noticed they were very careful about where they put their feet. It was almost like a dance or ritual—something very old, something stylized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Moira was saying, \"those poor women did absolutely nothing to deserve their fate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did! They—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoira went on, implacable. Her voice rang with truth and scorn. \"You\u0027ve shamed us all. You\u0027re crazy, but part of you knows. Part of you knows everything you are is wrong, and everything you\u0027ve done. Your father—Gerald—was the worst creature I\u0027ve ever known. But that doesn\u0027t excuse you. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you talk about my father. You\u0027re not fit for him to piss on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoira shook her head. Her outrage had fled; now she just looked terribly tired. \"You fooled us for a long time. But it\u0027s over now. You\u0027re not killing anyone tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong, half-breed.\" Geraldine leapt. Moira dodged, pivoted quicker than thought, and sent her small foot into Geraldine\u0027s side. Jared\u0027s eyes widened; the \u0027crack\u0027 was very loud. Amazing! In between collecting college degrees for the hell of it and running the Wyndham finances, his Moira had apparently found time to get a black belt in karate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredibly, Geraldine ignored the pain of broken ribs. He couldn\u0027t believe it, but she was still moving, and moving quickly—she spun and regained her center as rapidly as an adder. Too quickly for him to follow, both women were literally at each other\u0027s throats, locked in a brutal battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to get up. He tried. And again. But . . . too hard, everything hurt, his head was spinning, everything was so fast, how did Moira adjust to things happening so fast? It was almost as if she, too, possessed that same inhuman speed and agility, as if his Moira was one of the . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeraldine howled and all the hairs on the back of Jared\u0027s neck came to rigid attention. It was every bad or frightening sound he had ever heard, times ten. Everything that was in him wanted to run from the sound, get the Hell out and never, never come back. The part of his brain devoted 100% to survival was wide awake and screaming at him to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in response to the unearthly noise, Moira had made a final, desperate leap, and now she was—God, was she biting Geraldine? Her teeth were fastened at the juncture between Geraldine\u0027s neck and shoulder. The killer shrieked again and drove an elbow back into Moira\u0027s stomach. Moira grunted and held on. Geraldine\u0027s fist came up in a blur and then Moira was tumbling away. Geraldine pounced, quick as a cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared crawled toward them. He had no idea why. He sure as shit couldn\u0027t help Moira in his condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut somehow he was on his knees and he crawled, crawled. He saw Moira\u0027s hand come up, try to shove Geraldine away. Saw her claw for Geraldine\u0027s eyes. He crawled faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let this bitch kill another woman he loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groped for his pants leg, for the small pistol in the ankle holster. Geraldine hadn\u0027t known about it, or hadn\u0027t cared. It was practically a toy, anyway. A one-shot Derringer. His Marine buddies would laugh themselves into hernias if they saw him with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped crawling. He heard another wet snap and didn\u0027t know whose bone had broken. Moira was kicking Geraldine away, turning, trying to get distance. Geraldine was giggling through a mouthful of blood. Jared found the pistol . . . and dropped it right out of his bloody grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geraldine,\" he croaked, \"your daddy died screaming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got her attention; she snapped her head around so fast he practically heard it. Her eyes were huge; the irises looked like gold-flecked mud. \"What? What did you say, monkey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which word didn\u0027t you understand, cow, goat, uh—mammal with extra stomachs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruminator,\" Moira suggested faintly, trying to get to her feet and failing. He could see the bulge in her left leg, below her kneecap. He\u0027d heard her bone break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster would pay for that. \"Ruminator, thanks, babe. Oh, Geraldine?\" Groping, groping. Got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHang on. \"After Moira and I settle your hash, we\u0027re gonna find your dad\u0027s grave and fuck right on top of it.\" Hang on. \"That\u0027s not gonna be a problem, is—uurrggh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeraldine had jumped high in the air—impossibly high, his rational mind had trouble believing this wasn\u0027t a fantastic illusion—and landed squarely on top of him. That was fine. That was perfect. \"Bite me, dog,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe growled. \"Let\u0027s see those pearly whites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head swooped toward his, ready to tear out his throat. For my sister. For my love. He could smell Geraldine\u0027s breath: rank, meaty. This is the last thing my sister saw. Oh, God, help me now. He brought the Derringer up, jammed it into her mouth so hard he felt teeth break. Had time to register the killer\u0027s almost comical look of surprise before he pulled the trigger and blew the back of her head off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeraldine fell forward, onto him. He screamed, in horror and despair and rage for the dead. \"Moira!\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, Moira heaved the corpse off him. And that\u0027s about when everything went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared opened his eyes, and Moira shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owwwww!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said at once. He could see she was quite pale. Her eyes dominated her face and their color was deep, nearly purple, startling and mesmerizing at once. \"I\u0027m just really, really happy you\u0027re awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen, sister.\" He started to sit up, hardly able to take his eyes off her, then just as quickly gave up and flopped back onto the bed. \"Argh, even my hair hurts. Is it dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wyndham Manor. Also known as Dogs R Us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny girl.\" Jared glanced around the lush bedroom, which was roughly the size of his last apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight streamed through the west window. It was late, then. They\u0027d gone to Geraldine\u0027s before lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geraldine. God, what a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" Moira said tartly, \"is an understatement. FYI, none of the others can face you right now. They\u0027re so embarrassed they didn\u0027t see this before. Years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They shouldn\u0027t be.\" Jared paused. Yes, he had really said that. Weirder, he\u0027d meant it. Blaming the dogs—err, Moira\u0027s employers—had become habit. Bitter, but comforting in its familiarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut ten minutes with Geraldine had changed his mind about a lot of things. She\u0027d been so fast, so ruthless. So inhuman and, at the same time, heartbreakingly victimized. \"You guys thought you solved the problem when Gerald was killed. Who could blame you? You wanted the nightmare to be over. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s blame in that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\" Moira\u0027s tone was bitter, and Jared could see she would be blaming herself for a long time. She, who prided herself on her fine intelligence, hadn\u0027t noticed the killer living four miles from her bedroom. A difficult pill to swallow. He doubted Moira would do so gracefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost smiled. Christ, he adored her. She could have been killed—they both could have—but she never quit. She looked as innocent and delicate as a Hummel figurine, but had the temper of a wolverine and the tenaciousness of a pit bull. With rabies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thoughts derailed in sudden confusion. Geraldine was dead. His sister was avenged. Now what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSettle down with Moira? His life had been about vengeance since . . . well, since forever. Would there now be room for other things? Was it possible? The idea was as wonderful as it was terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVengeance was a cold blanket, but he\u0027d been able to wrap himself in it for years. Was there room now for more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t understand how she held together so long ,\" Moira muttered. She made a small fist and thumped her leg in agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how werewolves blend in with any humans,\" he said frankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoira shook her head. \"It\u0027s necessary. It\u0027s a skill learned early. What you saw—that wouldn\u0027t have fooled anyone. I think Geraldine was tired. She was tired, she wanted to be done. She quit holding herself together and stayed in her little house and waited for it to be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared thought back to the look on Geraldine\u0027s face when he shot her. Surprise, and . . . relief?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have bet his gun collection on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way,\" the love of his life interrupted his thoughts with heavy sarcasm,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister-I-can-take-on-a-werewolf-in-her-prime-so-stay-in-the-car-Moira, you\u0027re not moving from that bed for a week. Among other things, you\u0027ve got a nasty concussion and cracked ribs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got . . .\" Memory returned; he lunged forward. \"How\u0027s your leg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie back down.\" She gently pushed him back against the pillows. \"My leg?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jared-s-wolf-wyndham-werewolf-2/page-11.html","bookId":1883,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:25 PM"}
