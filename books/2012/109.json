In any case,’ she gestured with the mouthpiece, ‘the passage awaits you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping, the older woman slowly worked her way well clear of the water line. In her right hand was a splinter of wood, black against her bluish knuckles. Behind her, in the shallows, the ice was fast melting as the last remnants of Omtose Phellack faded. At the bay’s outer edge, where the shelf fell away to deeper water, the Undying Gratitude was settling lower into her glittering, weeping nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the handmaid had recovered enough to begin moving, she dressed herself in quilted undergarments and then the heavy scaled armour retrieved from bundles of waxed canvas. Taking up the paired throwing axes, a leather-sheathed short sword, an underarm holster of four throwing knives, and her helm, she completed her attire by tucking the wood splinter into her belt. ‘Highness, I am ready.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well said. My patience was wearing ominously thin.’ Sighing, Felash set the mouthpiece down and rose. ‘Where did you put the last of the sweets?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Beside the brick of rustleaf, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, I see. Wonderful. See how thin I’m getting? It’s an outrage. Do you recall your own childhood, dear, when your chest was flat and all your bones jutted every which way?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Highness, I was never boy-thin, thank the Errant’s nudge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nor me. I have always been suspicious of grown men who seem to like that in their women. What’s wrong with little boys if they’re into pallid bony wraiths?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps it appeals to their protective natures, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Protecting is one thing, diddling is entirely another. Now, where was I? Oh yes, throwing you into the Hold of Ice. Best unsheathe at least a few of your weapons, dear. Who knows what you’ll land in.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handmaid drew her axes. ‘I am ready.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘… that condescending, patronizing cow doesn’t deserve tits like that, or that soft blemish-free skin and lustrous hair. And the way those hips swing, why, I’m amazed she doesn’t throw out her back with every step, and those damned luscious lips look ready made to wrap themselves round— Gods, what was that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thunderclap shivered the water in the bay, set the sand to blurry trembling. Shurq Elalle turned to see an enormous white cloud billowing out and up from Felash’s camp. The sailors – well out of earshot behind her – were now on their feet, shouting in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stay here, Skorgen. And calm those fools down!’ She set off at a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp was a mess, gear flung about as if a whirlwind had erupted in its midst. Princess Felash was slowly picking herself up from the blasted sand. Her hair was awry, her clothes dishevelled. Her face was red, as if she’d been repeatedly slapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness, are you all right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl coughed. ‘I believe the theory has proved itself, Captain. It seems there is far more to Omtose Phellack than a few chunks of ice. The passage I found, well, it’s hard to say where precisely it led—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where is your handmaiden, Highness?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, let us hope she is exploring in wonder and delight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You sent her through?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash from her stunning eyes. ‘Of course I sent her through! Did you not insist on the necessity, given our terrible plight? Can you begin to imagine my sacrifice, the appalling extremity of the service we are providing here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShurq Elalle studied the plump girl. ‘What if she doesn’t come back?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I shall be most displeased. At the same time, we shall have before us evidence to support certain other theories about Omtose Phellack.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excuse me, what other theories?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why, the ones about shrieking demons, clouds of madness, flesh-eating plants, treacherous voles and a hundred other nightmares in a similar vein. Now, please be so kind as to rebuild my fire here, will you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for her last throwing knife, found the sheath empty. Cursing, she ducked beneath the scything slash and threw herself to the left, shoulder-rolling until she came up against the bulk of the first fiend she’d slain. Her hands scrabbled up its muricated hide, found the wedge of one of her axes. Grunting as she tugged it free, she rolled over the body – it quivered as six swords punched into it in the spot where she’d been a moment earlier – and regained her feet in time to send the axe flying. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-109.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
