See?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell phone rang - the sound shrill in the sudden silence. Both of us jumped. I got up to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien was so close, I shoved him back as I went by, and he let me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was a big, bad werewolf wouldn\u0027t he have killed me by now? Why wait? Avoid the rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was grasping at straws and I knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liebchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped the phone more tightly, calmed by Edward\u0027s voice. My eyes met Damien\u0027s and I hesitated. I knew what Edward would want me to do, and I couldn\u0027t. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I received your message,\" he continued. \"Any more information for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t that enough?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would say no. The native woman - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward, ever politically incorrect - what can you expect from an eighty-year-old-and-then-some former spy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her information was interesting, but we still do not know what the power eater plans for the night of the hunter\u0027s moon. You do not know where their lair is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any clues on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search for a gathering place. Isolated. Protected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been there, done that. Found nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot help you, Leigh. I am here; you are there. Do the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you come and help me?\" I blurted, then wished I hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward might look like anyone\u0027s great-granddad, but he wasn\u0027t. He\u0027d blow Damien\u0027s brains out without a second thought. Step on the remains, grind them into dust, and never flinch. Once I\u0027d been that way, too. Suddenly I wasn\u0027t, and it left me floundering and alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. Edward had been saying that since I\u0027d gotten to Crow Valley. It wasn\u0027t like him to avoid the action. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been trained for this job. You do not need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was clipped, angry. Something was going on, but I knew Edward well enough to know he wasn\u0027t going to tell me what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you done any further investigation of the odd dwelling with the human remains? I have never heard of anything like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich couldn\u0027t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been back. What should I look for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis from the man who knew everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to study Damien as I spoke to Edward. He leaned against the wall and stared right back. His odd, changeable, unblinking eyes should have made me leery. Instead they made me hot. I was crazier than even I thought I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn\u0027t I recognized Damien\u0027s eyes in those of the brown wolf? I\u0027d taken one glance at Hector in wolf form and known him for what he was. Damien... not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were strange - changing hue depending on the light and what he was wearing. Still, I should have known. Unless, maybe, I hadn\u0027t wanted to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward mumbled something on the other end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go, Leigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he did. Just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" Damien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly. Now what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there a way to check his story? Maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a Social Security number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\" At my frown he continued, \"I died in Germany, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. How was I going to check out his story without tipping off every Jager-Sucher in the country that I was investigating someone who was already dead? I had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question disturbed me so much, I let my guard drop. The next instant Damien stood right next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to bring up the rifle, but he snatched it away and tossed it on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heel of my hand shot toward his nose. Old habits are hard to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blocked the blow with a lightning-fast movement that nevertheless appeared lazy. How did they do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yanked me against his body, and he wouldn\u0027t let me go. My heart thundered in my ears, warring with the harsh, panting sound that at first I thought was him but in-stead turned out to be me. I was panicked, frightened, and so turned on my skin seemed to be dancing around on top of my bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he going to kill me? Or worse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled, but that only seemed to excite him more. His erection pressed against my stomach, pulsing and shifting, as if it had a life of its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his face to my neck, inhaled as if memorizing my scent. Hell, maybe he was. My hands were trapped against my body; my feet dangled above the floor. I could do nothing to stop him, and in truth, I didn\u0027t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue blazed a hot, wet trail from my collarbone to my ear. His teeth grazed the throbbing vein at the curve. I shuddered as he nibbled and laved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were free. Instead of socking him in the eye, I pulled him closer, my fingers tangling in the dark, curling strands of his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen had my legs wrapped around his waist? When had his palms cupped my ass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nuzzled the tops of my breasts. I yanked my shirt down and his mouth closed over a nipple, his tongue pressing me against the roof of his mouth, once, twice, again. I tightened my legs. I was going to come. He lifted his head and whispered, \"I love you, Leigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body went ice-cold. I didn\u0027t have to struggle; this time when I pulled away he let me go. My breasts were still exposed, wet from his mouth, aching with arousal and frustration. I covered myself and fought the urge to take a shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurt flickered in his eyes; his face hardened. \"It\u0027s OK to have sex with you but not to love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my chin. \"That\u0027s right. I seem to recall a deal that involved taking what you could get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been taking most of my life. I\u0027ve finally found someone I want to give something to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not buying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not selling. I\u0027m giving. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop saying that!\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy had loved me. It had gotten him killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien could take care of himself, like Hector. Who had also loved me. Sick son of a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich man did Damien most favor? Sweet Jimmy who\u0027d wanted nothing more than for me to be happy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr demonic Hector who\u0027d only wanted me to be like him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh,\" Damien whispered, his fingers caressing my arm, his breath in my hair. \"What can I do to make you believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was swaying toward him before I realized it. Since I\u0027d lost my family, my future, and my mind, I\u0027d prided myself on my self-reliance. I needed no one. In that way I could never be destroyed again when someone I loved died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many days had I known Damien? Already my body accepted his nearness, trusted him above my head and my heart. Stupid body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to lean on him, believe in him, but I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched away, stood on my own again, even though my hand lingered on his arm, slid through his palm, fingers clinging for just an instant to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" I answered, which was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I prove he wasn\u0027t an evil werewolf when, as far as I knew, there\u0027d never been a nonevil one before? Asking Edward would raise too many questions. Same thing with Jessie and Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door burst open and Damien shoved me behind him. Impressive. But was the move real or had he heard Jessie pounding up the stairs with his superwolf powers? More than likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knock much?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored me. Her face was eager; she was practically dancing on the tips of her toes. \"I have to talk to you,\" she blurted. \"Alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien shrugged and headed for the door. I reached for him and caught just the tail of his shirt. The silk slid through my fingers and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want him out of my sight. What if I never saw him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien?\" He turned. \"Don\u0027t - uh - go anywhere, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a brow. \"Where would I go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he trying to be a smart-ass? I couldn\u0027t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, Leigh, you can hop back into the sack with him later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. Thankfully she didn\u0027t notice, but Damien did. His eyes went sad and he slipped out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I feel as though I\u0027d kicked a puppy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe analogy almost made me laugh until Jessie spoke. \"We\u0027ve got two more half-eaten wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elwood found them near his house about forty-five minutes ago. He lives a good thirty miles on the other side of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty miles from Crow Valley. Ten miles from the tavern to town, which made forty miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had they been dead long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the best part. Elwood saw the wolf eating them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes met. I didn\u0027t even have to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"White,\" she said. \"Just like we thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean much with super-duper shape-shifter powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t hurt, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what she\u0027d said. The white wolf had been seen forty miles from here at the same time I\u0027d been saved by a brown wolf, which I knew to be Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t mean Damien couldn\u0027t have killed those wolves; he could even have had a nibble or two. But he couldn\u0027t be the white wolf. This was good news and made me feel a little bit better about not telling Jessie the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ran all the way out here and burst in like a kid on Christmas morning to tell me this?\" I asked. \"You couldn\u0027t use the phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shut it off, dip wad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, crossed the room, glanced at my cell. I had. Chalk it up to having my life come apart at the seams again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was talking to Edward,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything interesting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie nodded as if she\u0027d expected as much. \"Cora called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" She found something interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In her Textbook of Witches and Werewolves.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How the hell should I know? Cadotte was practically prancing when he got off the phone. Couldn\u0027t wait to tell you all about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie opened her mouth, then shut it again, shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pointed out that this information might be easier coming from a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAw, hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spill it, Jessie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we sit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That bad, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going to like it. That much I know. But Will\u0027s on the job. He\u0027s searching every Internet corner and every book that he has to find a way to stop this before it happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie sat on the couch. I perched on the edge of a chair. She sighed and spilled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember what Sister Spooky said about the night of the hunter\u0027s moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sacrifice. Blood, death, tears. Yada yada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie smiled. \"There\u0027s a little more to it than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there always?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. Did you know that only the alpha pair in a wolf pack can mate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I seem to recall something about it in Wolf Behavior 333.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie lifted a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell. Supreme alpha. The ritual involves sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His mate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy back started to burn as if someone had doused it with kerosene and struck a match. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-31.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
