I have amnesia. Messed up, right? \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t know the half of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eNot remembering anything has turned my world upside down. My parents try their hardest to “remind” me of who I was, but it doesn\u0027t feel right. Or, if what they\u0027re saying is true and that really was me, I\u0027m not sure I like that person very much. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s my love life. Apparently, Gavin Ariastasis is my oldest and best friend in the world. Also, apparently, we’ve never dated. But now, noticing him for what feels like the first time, he’s making my heart do somersaults. He knows me inside and out—the real me. Plus, he’s sexy and charming as hell. Sounds perfect, right? \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut then... there’s the new guy. Quinn McKeyen – tall, gorgeous and deliciously American. His mischievous grin and slow Midwestern drawl turn my insides to mush in two seconds flat making me question who I really am and what I really want. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSeriously. What am I supposed to do with all that?! I feel torn between them, but I barely even know who I am, let alone what I want. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI just hope my indecisive heart will clue me in. And sooner rather than later…before I lose what little of my mind that I have left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/mia-s-heart.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/mia-s-heart.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:34 PM"}
