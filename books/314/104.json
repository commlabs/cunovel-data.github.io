And how about the pizza car?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thought I would do that later, sir -- \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to be capable of doing more than one thing at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant turns away, shamed and awed. \"Ky,\" Uncle Enzo says, \"anything interesting happening on our perimeter?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing at all,\" Ng says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything interesting?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A few maintenance workers, as normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know they are maintenance workers and not Rife soldiers in costume? Did you check their IDs?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Soldiers carry guns. Or at least knives. Radar shows that these men do not. Q.E.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Still trying to get all our men to check in,\" the lieutenant says. \"Having a little radio trouble, I guess.\" Uncle Enzo puts one arm around the lieutenant\u0027s shoulders. \"Let me tell you a story, son. From the first moment I saw you, I thought you seemed familiar. Finally I realized that you remind me of someone I used to know: a lieutenant who was my commanding officer, for a while, in Vietnam.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant is thrilled. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He was young, bright, ambitious, well educated. And well meaning. But he had certain deficiencies. He had a stubborn inability to grasp the fundamentals of our situation over there. A sort of mental block, if you will, that caused those of us who were serving under him to experience the most intense kind of frustration. It was touch and go for a while, son, I don\u0027t mind telling you that\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How did it work out, Uncle Enzo?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It worked out fine. You see, one day, I took it upon myself to shoot him in the back of the head.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant\u0027s eyes get very big, and his face seems paralyzed. Uncle Enzo has no sympathy for him at all: if he screws this up, people could die.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome new piece of radio babble comes in over the lieutenant\u0027s headset. \"Oh, Uncle Enzo?\" he says, very quietly and reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You were asking about that pizza car?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not there.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not there?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently, when they set down to pick up Rife, a man got out of the chopper and climbed into the pizza car and drove it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did he drive it to?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know, sir, we only had one spotter in the area, and he was tracking Rife.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Take off your headset,\" Uncle Enzo says. \"And turn off that walkie-talkie. You need your ears.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My ears?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUncle Enzo drops into a crouch and walks briskly across the pavement until he is between a couple of small jets. He sets the skateboard down quietly. Then he unties his shoelaces and pulls his shoes off. He takes his socks off, too, and stuffs them into the shoes. He takes the straight razor out of his pocket, flips it open, and slits both of his trouser legs from the hem up to his groin, then bunches the material up and cuts it off. Otherwise the fabric will slide over his hairy legs when he walks and make noise.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My God!\" the lieutenant says, a couple of planes over. \"Al is down! My God, he\u0027s dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUncle Enzo leaves his jacket on, for now, because it\u0027s dark, and because it\u0027s lined with satin so that it is relatively quiet. Then he climbs up onto the wing of one of the planes so that his legs cannot be seen by someone crouching on the ground. He hunkers down on the end of the wing, opens his mouth so that he can hear better, and listens.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he can hear at first is an uneven spattering noise that wasn\u0027t there before, like water falling out of a half-open faucet onto bare pavement. The sound seems to be coming from a nearby airplane. Uncle Enzo is afraid that it may be jet fuel leaking onto the ground, as part of a scheme to blow up this whole section of the airport and take out all opposition at a stroke. He drops silently to the ground, makes his way carefully around a couple of adjacent planes, stopping every few feet to listen, and finally sees it: one of his soldiers has been pinned to the aluminum fuselage of a Learjet by means of a long wooden pole. Blood runs out of the wound, down his pant legs, drips from his shoes, and spatters onto the tarmac.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind him, Uncle Enzo hears a brief scream that suddenly turns into a sharp gaseous exhalation. He has heard it before. It is a man having a sharp knife drawn across his throat. It is undoubtedly the lieutenant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe has a few seconds to move freely now. He doesn\u0027t even know what he\u0027s up against, and he needs to know that. So he runs in the direction the scream came from, moving quickly from cover of one jet to the next, staying down in a crouch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe sees a pair of legs moving on the opposite side of a jet\u0027s fuselage. Uncle Enzo is near the tip of the jet\u0027s wing. He puts both hands on it, shoves down with all his weight, and then lets it go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt works: the jet rocks toward him on its suspension. The assassin thinks that Uncle Enzo has just jumped up onto the wingtip, so he climbs up onto the opposite wing and waits with his back to the fuselage, waiting to ambush Enzo when he climbs over the top.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Enzo is still on the ground. He runs in toward the fuselage on silent, bare feet, ducks beneath it, and comes up from underneath with his straight razor in one hand. The assassin -- Raven -- is right where Enzo expected him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Raven is already getting suspicious; he stands up to look over the top of the fuselage, and that puts his throat out of reach. Enzo\u0027s looking at his legs instead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s better to be conservative and take what you can get than take a big gamble and blow it, so Enzo reaches in, even as Raven is looking down at him, and severs Raven\u0027s left Achilles tendon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs he\u0027s turning away to protect himself, something hits him very hard in the chest. Uncle Enzo looks down and is astonished to see a transparent object protruding from the right side of his rib cage. Then he looks up to see Raven\u0027s face three inches from his.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUncle Enzo steps back away from the wing. Raven was hoping to fall on top of him but instead tumbles to the ground. Enzo steps back in, reaching forward with his razor, but Raven, sitting on the tarmac, has already drawn a second knife. He lunges for the inside of Uncle Enzo\u0027s thigh and does some damage; Enzo sidesteps away from the blade, throwing off his attack, and ends up making a short but deep cut on the top of Raven\u0027s shoulder. Raven knocks his arm aside before Enzo can go for the throat again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUncle Enzo\u0027s hurt and Raven\u0027s hurt. But Raven can\u0027t outrun him anymore; it\u0027s time to take stock of things a little bit. Enzo runs away, though when he moves, terrible pains run up and down the right side of his body. Something thuds into his back, too; he feels a sharp pain above one kidney, but only for a moment. He turns around to see a bloody piece of glass shattering on the pavement. Raven must have thrown it into his back. But without Raven\u0027s arm strength behind it, it didn\u0027t have enough momentum to penetrate all the way through the bulletproof fabric, and it fell out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGlass knives. No wonder Ky didn\u0027t see him on millimeter wave.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he gets behind the cover of another plane, his sense of hearing is being overwhelmed by the approach of a chopper.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is Rife\u0027s chopper, settling down on the tarmac a few dozen meters away from the jet. The thunder of the rotor blades and the blast of the wind seem to penetrate into Uncle Enzo\u0027s brain. He closes his eyes against the wind and utterly loses his balance, has no idea where he is until he slams full-length into the pavement. The pavement beneath him is slippery and warm, and Uncle Enzo realizes that he is losing a great deal of blood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStaring across the tarmac, he sees Raven making his way toward the aircraft, limping horrendously, one leg virtually useless. Finally, he gives up on it and just hops on his good leg.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRife has climbed down out of the chopper. Raven and Rife are talking, Raven gesticulating back in Enzo\u0027s direction. Then Rife nods his approval, and Raven turns around, his teeth bright and white. He\u0027s not grimacing so much as he is smiling in anticipation. He begins to hop toward Uncle Enzo, pulling another glass knife out of his jacket The bastard is carrying a million of those things. He\u0027s coming after Enzo, and Enzo can\u0027t even stand up without passing out. He looks around and sees nothing but a skateboard and a pair of expensive shoes and socks about twenty feet away. He can\u0027t stand up, but he can do the GI crawl, and so he begins to pull himself forward on his elbows even as Raven is hopping toward him one-legged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey meet in an open lane between two adjacent jets. Enzo is on his belly, slumped over the skateboard. Raven is standing, supporting himself with one hand on the wing of the jet, the glass knife glittering in his other hand. Enzo is now seeing the world in dim black and white, like a cheap Metaverse terminal; this is how his buddies used to describe it in Vietnam right before they succumbed to blood loss.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hope you\u0027ve done your last rites,\" Raven says, \"because there ain\u0027t no time to call a priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no need for one,\" Uncle Enzo says, and punches the button on the skateboard labeled \"RadiKS Narrow Cone Tuned Shock Wave Projector.\" The concussion nearly blows his head off. Uncle Enzo, if he survives, will never hear well again. But it does wake him up a little bit. He lifts his head off the board to see Raven standing there stunned, empty-handed, a thousand tiny splinters of broken glass raining down out of his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUncle Enzo rolls over on his back and waves his straight razor in the air. \"I prefer steel myself,\" he says. \"Would you like a shave?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/769.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
