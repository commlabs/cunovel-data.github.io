When the will cleared probate Amanda and I each inherited slightly in excess of six hundred thousand dollars. I rather doubt that she spent it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBY the time we were through it was getting close to five o\u0027clock and the bar business was beginning to pick up as the first of the Happy Hour set arrived. I had filled several pages in my pocket notebook and had begun turning down coffee refills. Lyman Warriner had switched from tea to beer and was halfway through a tall glass of Prior dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to set a fee, and as always I didn\u0027t know how much to ask for. I gathered that he could afford whatever I charged him but that didn\u0027t really enter into my calculations. The number I settled on was $2500, and he didn\u0027t ask me how I\u0027d arrived there, just took out a checkbook and uncapped a fountain pen. I couldn\u0027t remember the last time I\u0027d seen one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Matthew Scudder? Two t\u0027s, two d\u0027s?\" I nodded and he wrote out the check and waved it to dry the ink. I told him that he might have a refund coming if things went faster than I expected, or that I might ask for more money if it seemed appropriate. He nodded. He didn\u0027t seem terribly concerned about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the check, and he said, \"I just want to know, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That might be the most you can hope for. Finding out that he did it and turning up something that\u0027ll stand up in court are two different things. You could wind up with your suspicions confirmed and your brother-in-law still getting away with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to prove anything to a jury, Matthew. Just prove it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t feel that I could let that go. I said, \"It sounds as though you\u0027re thinking of taking matters into your own hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already done that, haven\u0027t I? Hiring a private detective. Not letting matters take their own course, not allowing the mills of God to grind in their traditionally slow fashion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t want to be part of something that winds up with you on trial for Richard Thurman\u0027s murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a moment. Then he said, \"I won\u0027t pretend it hasn\u0027t occurred to me. But I honestly don\u0027t think I would do it. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s my style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? I wonder.\" He motioned for the waitress, gave her twenty dollars and waved away change. Our check couldn\u0027t have come to more than a quarter of that, but we\u0027d taken up a table for three hours. He said, \"If he killed her, he was exceedingly stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murder is always stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think so? I\u0027m not sure I agree, but you\u0027re more the expert than I. No, my point is that he acted prematurely. He should have waited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More money. Don\u0027t forget, I inherited the same amount Amanda did, and I can assure you I haven\u0027t pissed it away. Amanda would have been my heir, and the beneficiary of my insurance.\" He took out a cigarette, put it back in the pack. \"I wouldn\u0027t have had anyone else to leave it to,\" he said. \"My lover died a year and a half ago, of a four-letter disease.\" He smiled thinly. \"Not gout. The other one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m HIV-positive,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve known for several years. I lied to Amanda. I told her I\u0027d been tested and I was negative, so I had nothing to worry about.\" His eyes sought mine. \"That seemed like an ethical lie, don\u0027t you think? Since I wasn\u0027t about to have sex with her, why burden her with the truth?\" He took out the cigarette but didn\u0027t light it. \"Besides,\" he said, \"there was a chance I might not get sick. Having the antibody may not necessarily mean having the virus. Well, scratch that. The first telltale purple blotch appeared this past August. KS. That\u0027s Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the short-term death sentence it was a year or two ago. I could live a long time. I could live ten years, even more.\" He lit the cigarette. \"But,\" he said, \"somehow I have a feeling that\u0027s not going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, got his topcoat from the rack. I reached for mine and followed him out to the street. A cab came along right away and he hailed it. He opened the rear door, then turned to me once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hadn\u0027t got around to telling Amanda,\" he said. \"I thought I\u0027d tell her at Thanksgiving, but of course by then it was too late. So she didn\u0027t know, and of course he wouldn\u0027t have known, so he couldn\u0027t have realized the financial advantage in delaying her murder.\" He threw his cigarette away. \"It\u0027s ironic,\" he said, \"isn\u0027t it? If I\u0027d told her I was dying, she might be alive today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up the next morning and put Warriner\u0027s check in the bank and drew some walking-around money while I was at it. We\u0027d had a little snow over the weekend but most of it was gone now, with just a little gray residue left at the curbs. It was cold out, but there wasn\u0027t much wind and it wasn\u0027t a bad day for the middle of winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to Midtown North on West Fifty-fourth, hoping to catch Joe Durkin, but he wasn\u0027t there. I left word for him to call me and walked on down to the main library at Forty-second and Fifth. I spent a couple of hours reading everything I could find about the murder of Amanda Warriner Thurman. While I was at it I looked for her and her husband in the New York Times Index over the past ten years. I read their wedding announcement, which had appeared four years ago September. She would already have come into her inheritance by then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had already learned when they were married from Warriner, but it never hurts to confirm things a client tells you. The announcement furnished me with other information Warriner hadn\u0027t given me- the names of Thurman\u0027s parents and others in the wedding party, the schools he\u0027d attended, the jobs he\u0027d held before he went with Five Borough Cable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing I turned up told me that he had or hadn\u0027t murdered his wife, but I hadn\u0027t figured to solve the case with two hours of library research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Midtown North from a pay phone on the corner. Joe hadn\u0027t come back. I had a Sabrett hot dog and a knish for lunch and walked over to the Swedish church on Forty-eighth, where there\u0027s a twelve-thirty meeting on weekdays. The speaker was a commuter who lived with his family on Long Island and worked for one of the Big Six accounting firms. He\u0027d been sober ten months and couldn\u0027t get over how wonderful it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got your message,\" Durkin said. \"I tried you at your hotel but they said you were out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on my way there now,\" I said. \"I thought I\u0027d take a chance, see if I\u0027d catch you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, today\u0027s your lucky day, Matt. Have a seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fellow came to see me yesterday,\" I said. \"Lyman Warriner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The brother. I figured he\u0027d call you. You gonna do something for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can,\" I said. I had palmed a hundred-dollar bill and I tucked it between his fingers. \"I appreciate the referral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were alone in the office, so he felt free to unfold the bill and look at it. \"It\u0027s a good one,\" I assured him. \"I was there when they printed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I feel better,\" he said. \"No, what I was just thinking is I shouldn\u0027t even take this from you. You want to know why? Because it\u0027s not just a case of throwing a couple of bucks your way and keeping the citizen happy. I\u0027m glad you took the guy on. I\u0027d love to see you do him some good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Thurman did his wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I think? I fucking know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered the question. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Cop instinct. How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds good to me. Between your cop instinct and Lyman\u0027s feminine intuition, I figure Thurman\u0027s lucky to be walking around free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you met the guy, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See if you don\u0027t read him the same way I did. He\u0027s one phony son of a bitch, I swear to God. I caught that case, I was the first person in there after the blues who responded to the 911 call. I saw him then, when he was still in shock and bleeding from a head wound and with his face red and raw from where he\u0027d worked the tape off of his mouth. I saw him I don\u0027t know how many times over the next couple of weeks. Matt, he never rang true. I just did not buy that he was sorry she was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wouldn\u0027t necessarily mean he killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a point. I\u0027ve known killers who were sorry their victim was dead and I suppose it works the other way around. And I\u0027m not setting myself up as Joseph Durkin the Human Polygraph. I can\u0027t always tell when somebody\u0027s lying. But with him it\u0027s easy. If his lips are moving, he\u0027s feeding you a line of shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All by himself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I don\u0027t see how. The woman was raped fore and aft with signs of forced entry. Semen deposited vaginally was definitely not from the husband. Different blood type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No semen deposited anally. Maybe the guy in back was practicing safe sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rape in the modern age,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s all those leaflets the Surgeon General mailed out, raising the level of public consciousness and all. Anyway, from the looks of it you got your two burglars just the way the husband told it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any other physical evidence besides semen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short and curlies. Seem to be two types, one that\u0027s definitely not the husband\u0027s, the other that\u0027s a possible. The thing is, you can\u0027t tell too much from pubic hair. You can tell both samples are from male Caucasians but that\u0027s about all you can get. Plus it doesn\u0027t prove anything if some of the hairs are Thurman\u0027s, because they were married, for Christ\u0027s sake, and it\u0027s not unheard of to carry your husband\u0027s pubic hair around in your bush for a day or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a moment. I said, \"In order for Thurman to have done it solo-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it could. All he needed was some foreign semen and pubic hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would he come by that? Blow a sailor and spit in a Glad bag?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought fleetingly of Lyman Warriner\u0027s perception of Thurman as a closet case. \"I suppose that\u0027s as good a way as any,\" I said. \"I\u0027m just running through what\u0027s remotely possible and what isn\u0027t. One way or another he obtained specimens of foreign semen and hair. He went to the party with his wife, came home-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Climbed three flights of stairs and told her to wait a minute while he forced entry to the Gottschalk apartment. \u0027Look, honey, I learned this neat way to open doors without the key.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The door was forced?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That could have been done after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After he\u0027d killed her and before he called 911. Say he had a key to the Gottschalk place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what the Gottschalks say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have had one without them knowing about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had a couple of locks on the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have had a couple of keys. \u0027Hang on, honey, I promised Roy and Irma I\u0027d water the plants.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not their names. Alfred Gottschalk, that\u0027s the lawyer. I forget the wife\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I promised Alfred and Whatsername I\u0027d water the plants.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At one in the morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the difference? Maybe he says he wants to borrow a book from the Gottschalks, something he\u0027s been wanting to read. Maybe they\u0027re both a little giddy from the party and he tells her they\u0027ll sneak into the Gottschalk apartment and screw in their bed.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-4.html","bookId":2327,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM"}
