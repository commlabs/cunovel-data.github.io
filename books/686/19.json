{"id":37665,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX","content":"\u0026nbsp;Montague brought a couple of chairs, and the two seated themselves at the window for a long wait. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How did you learn about this conference?” asked Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Be careful,” whispered the other in his ear. “We mustn\u0027t make a noise, because Rodney will need quiet to hear them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague saw that the cord was jerking again. Bates spelled out the letters one by one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “W-a-t-e-r-m-a-n. D-u-v-a-l. He\u0027s telling us who\u0027s there. David Ward. Hegan. Prentice.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Prentice!” whispered Montague. “Why, he\u0027s up in the Adirondacks!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He came down on a special train to-day,” whispered the other. “Ward telegraphed him—I think that\u0027s where we got our tip. Henry Patterson. He\u0027s the real head of the Oil Trust now. Bascom of the Empire Bank. He\u0027s Waterman\u0027s man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can imagine from that list that there\u0027s something big going on,” Bates muttered; and he spelled the names of several other bankers, heads of the most important institutions in Wall Street.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Talking about Stewart,” spelled out Rodney.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s ancient history,” muttered Bates. “He\u0027s a dead one.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “P-r-i-c-e,” spelled Rodney.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Price!” exclaimed Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said the other. “I saw him down in the lobby. I rather thought he\u0027d come.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But to a conference with Waterman!” exclaimed Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s all right,” said Bates. “Why not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But they are deadly enemies!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh,” said the other, “you don\u0027t want to let yourself believe things like that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you mean?” protested Montague. “Do you suppose they\u0027re not enemies?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I certainly do suppose it,” said Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But, man! I can give you positive facts that prove they are.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For every fact that you bring,” laughed the other, “I can bring half a dozen to show you they are not.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But that is perfectly absurd!” began Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hush,” said Bates, and he waited while the string jerked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I-c-e,” spelled Rodney.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s Cummings—another dead one,” said Bates. “My Lord, but they did him up brown!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who did it?” asked Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Waterman,” answered the other. “The Steamship Trust was competing with his New England railroads, and now it\u0027s in the hands of a receiver. Before long you\u0027ll hear that he\u0027s gathered it in.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you think this last smash-up was planned?” said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Planned! My Heavens, man, it was the greatest gobbling up of the little fish that I have ever known since I\u0027ve been in Wall Street!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And it was Waterman?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “With the Oil Trust. They were after young Stewart. You see, he beat them out in Montana, and they had to buy him off for ten million dollars. But he was fool enough to come to New York and go in for banking; and now they\u0027ve got his banks, and a good part of his ten millions as well!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It takes a man\u0027s breath away,” said Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just save your breath-you\u0027ll need it to-night,” said Bates, drily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The other sat in thought for a moment. “We were talking about Price,” he whispered. “Do you mean John S. Price?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There is only one Price that I know of,” was the reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you don\u0027t believe that he and Waterman are enemies?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I mean that Price is simply one of Waterman\u0027s agents in every big thing he does.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But, man! Doesn\u0027t he own the Mississippi Steel Company?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He owns it for Waterman,” said Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But that is impossible,” cried Montague. “Isn\u0027t Waterman interested in the Steel Trust? And isn\u0027t Mississippi Steel its chief competitor?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is supposed to be,” said the other. “But that is simply a bluff to fool the public. There has been no real competition between them ever since four years ago, when Price raided the stock and captured it for Waterman.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague was staring at his friend, almost speechless with amazement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Bates,” he said, “it happens that I was very recently connected with Price and the Mississippi Steel Company in a very intimate way; and I know most positively that what you say is not true.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s very hard to answer a statement like that,” Bates responded. “I\u0027d have to know just what your facts are. But they\u0027d have to be very convincing indeed to make an impression upon me, for I ran that story down pretty thoroughly. I got it straight from the inside, and I got all the details of it. I nailed Price down, right in his own office. The only trouble was that my people wouldn\u0027t print the facts.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was some time before Montague spoke again. He was groping around in his own mind, trying to grasp the significance of what Bates had said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But Price was fighting Waterman!” he whispered. “The whole crowd were fighting him! That was the whole purpose of what they were doing. It had no sense otherwise.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But are you sure?” asked the other. “Think it over. Suppose they were only pretending to fight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a silence again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mind you,” Bates added, “I am only speaking about Price himself. I don\u0027t know about any people he may have been with. He may have been deceiving them—he may have been leading them into a trap—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And suddenly Montague clutched the arms of his chair. He sat staring ahead of him, struck dumb by the thought which the other\u0027s words had brought to him. “My God,” he gasped; and again, and yet again, “My God!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It seemed to unroll before him, in vista after vista. Price deceiving Ryder! leading him into that Northern Mississippi deal; getting him to lend money upon the stock of the Mississippi Steel Company; promising, perhaps, to support the stock in the market, and helping to smash it instead! Twisting Ryder around his finger, crushing him—and why? And why?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague\u0027s thoughts stopped still. It was as if he had found himself suddenly confronted by a bottomless abyss. He shrank back from it. He could not face the thought in his own mind. Waterman! It was Dan Waterman! It was something which he had planned! It was the vengeance that he had threatened! He had been all this time plotting it, setting his nets about Ryder\u0027s feet!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was an idea so wild and so horrible that Montague fought it off. He pushed it away from him, again and again. No, no, it could not be!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And yet, why not? He had always felt certain in his own mind that that detective had come from Waterman. The old man had set to work to find out about Lucy and her affairs, the first time that he had ever laid eyes on her. And then suddenly Montague saw the face of volcanic fury that had flashed past him on board the Brünnhilde. “You will hear from me again,” the old man had said; and now, all these months of silence—and at last he heard!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Why not? Why not? Montague kept asking himself. After all, what did he know about the Mississippi Steel Company? What had he ever seen to prove that it was actually competing with the Trust? What had he even heard, except what Stanley Ryder had told him; and what more likely than that Ryder was simply repeating what Price had said?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague had forgotten all about his present situation in the rush of thoughts which had come to him. The cord had been jerking again, and had spelled out the names of several more of the masters of the city who had arrived; but he had not heard their names. “What object would there be,” he asked, “in keeping the fact a secret—I mean that Price was Waterman\u0027s agent?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Object!” exclaimed Bates. “Good Heavens, and with the public half crazy about monopolies, and the President making such a fight! If it were known that the Steel Trust had gathered in its last big competitor, you can\u0027t tell what the Government might do!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see,” said Montague. “And how long has this been?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Four years,” was the reply; “all they\u0027re waiting for is some occasion like this, when they can put the Company in a hole, and pose as benefactors in taking it over.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see,” said Montague, again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Listen,” said Bates, and leaned out of the window. He could catch faintly the sounds of a deep voice in the consultation room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “W-a-t-e-r-m-a-n,” spelled Rodney.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I guess business has begun,” whispered Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Situation intolerable,” spelled Rodney. “End wildcat banking.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That means end of opposition to me,” was the other\u0027s comment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Duval assents,” continued Rodney.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two in the window were on edge by this time. It was tantalising to have to wait several minutes, and then get only such snatches.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But they\u0027ll get past the speech-making pretty soon,” whispered Bates; and indeed they did.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next two words which the cord spelled out made Montague sit up and clutch the arms of his chair again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Gotham Trust!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!” whispered Bates. Montague made not a sound.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ryder misusing,” spelled the cord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bates seized his companion by the arm, and leaned close to him. “By the Lord!” he whispered breathlessly, “I wonder if they\u0027re going to smash the Gotham Trust!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Refuse clearing,” spelled Rodney; and Montague felt Bates\u0027s hand trembling. “They refuse to clear for Ryder!” he panted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague was beyond all speech; he sat as if turned to stone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To-morrow morning,” spelled the cord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bates could hardly keep still for his excitement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you catch what that means?” he whispered. “The Clearing-house is to throw out the Gotham Trust!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, they\u0027ll wreck it!” panted the other.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My God, my God, they\u0027re mad!” cried Bates. “Don\u0027t they realise what they\u0027ll do? There\u0027ll be a panic such as New York has never seen before! It will bring down every bank in the city! The Gotham Trust! Think of it!—the Gotham Trust!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Prentice objects,” came Rodney\u0027s next message.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Objects!” exclaimed Bates, striking his knee in repressed excitement. “I should think he might object. If the Gotham Trust goes down, the Trust Company of the Republic won\u0027t live for twenty-four hours.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Afraid,” spelled the cord. “Patterson angry.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Much he has to lose,” muttered Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague started up and began to pace the room. “Oh, this is horrible, horrible!” he exclaimed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through all the images of the destruction and suffering which Bates\u0027s words brought up before him, his thoughts flew back to a pale and sad-faced little woman, sitting alone in an apartment up on the Riverside. It was to her that it all came back; it was for her that this terrible drama was being enacted. Montague could picture the grim, hawk-faced old man, sitting at the head of the council board, and laying down the law to the masters of the Metropolis. And this man\u0027s thoughts, too, went back to Lucy—his and Montague\u0027s alone, of all those who took part in the struggle!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Waterman protect Prentice,” spelled Rodney. “Insist turn out Ryder. Withdraw funds.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s no doubt of it,” whispered Bates; “they can finish him if they choose. But oh, my Lord, what will happen in New York to-morrow!\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ward protect legitimate banks,” was the next message.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The little whelp!” sneered Bates. “By legitimate banks he means those that back his syndicates. A lot of protecting he will do!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But then the newspaper man in Bates rose to the surface. “Oh, what a story,” he whispered, clenching his hands, and pounding his knees. “Oh, what a story!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Montague carried away but a faint recollection of the rest of Rodney\u0027s communications; he was too much overwhelmed by his own thoughts. Bates, however, continued to spell out the words; and he caught the statement that General Prentice, who was a director in the Gotham Trust, was to vote against any plan to close the doors of that institution. While they were after it, they were going to finish it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Also he caught the sentence, “Panic useful, curb President!” And he heard Bates\u0027s excited exclamations over that. “Did you catch that?” he cried. “That\u0027s Waterman! Oh, the nerve of it! We are in at the making of history to-night, Mr. Montague.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Perhaps half an hour later, Montague, standing beside Bates, saw his hand jerked violently several times.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That means pull up!” cried he. “Quick!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he seized the rope. “Put your weight on it,” he whispered. “It will hold.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They proceeded to haul. Rodney helped them by catching hold of the cornice of the window and lifting himself. Then there was a moment of great straining, during which Montague held his breath; after which the weight grew lighter again. Rodney had got his knees upon the cornice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A few moments later his fingers appeared, clutching the edge of the sill. He swung himself up, and Montague and Bates grasped him under the arms, and fairly jerked him into the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He staggered to his feet; and there was a moment\u0027s pause, while all three caught their breath. Then Rodney leaped at Bates, and grasped him by the shoulders. “Old man!” he cried. “We landed them! We landed them!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We landed them!” laughed the other in exultation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, what a scoop!” shouted Rodney. “There was never one like it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two were like schoolboys in their glee. They hugged each other, and laughed and danced about. But it was not long before they became serious again. Montague turned on the lights, and pulled down the window; and Rodney stood there, with his clothing dishevelled and his face ablaze with excitement, and talked to them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, you can\u0027t imagine that scene!” he said. “It makes my hair stand on end to think of it. Just fancy—I was not more than twenty feet from Dan Waterman, and most of the time he seemed to be glaring right at me. I hardly dared wink, for fear he\u0027d notice; and I thought every instant he would jump up and run to the window. But there he sat, and pounded on the table, and glared about at those fellows, and laid down the law to them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ve heard him talk,” said Bates. “I know how it is.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, he fairly knocked them over!” said the other. “You could have heard a pin drop when he got through. Oh, it was a mad thing to see!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ve hardly been able to get my breath,” said Bates. “I can\u0027t believe it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They have no idea what it will mean,” said Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They know,” said Rodney; “but they don\u0027t care. They\u0027ve smelt blood. That\u0027s about the size of it—they were like a lot of hounds on the trail. You should have seen Waterman, with that lean, hungry face of his. \u0027The time has come,\u0027 said he. \u0027There\u0027s no one here but has known that sooner or later this work had to be done. We must crush them, once and for all time!\u0027 And you should have seen him turn on Prentice, when he ventured a word.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Prentice doesn\u0027t like it, then?” asked Montague.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should think he wouldn\u0027t!” put in Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Waterman said he\u0027d protect him,” said Rodney. “But he must place himself absolutely in their hands. It seems that the Trust Company of the Republic has a million dollars with the Gotham Trust, and that\u0027s to be withdrawn.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Imagine it!” gasped Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And wait!” exclaimed the other; “then they got on to politics. I would have given one arm if I could have got a photograph of Dan Waterman at that moment—just to spread it before the American people and ask them what they thought of it! David Ward had made the remark that \u0027A little trouble mightn\u0027t have a bad effect just now.\u0027 And Waterman brought down his fist on the table. \u0027This country needs a lesson,\u0027 he cried. \u0027There\u0027s been too much abuse of responsible men, and there\u0027s been too much wild talk in high places. If the people get a little taste of hard times, they\u0027ll have something else to think about besides abusing those who have made the prosperity of the country; and it seems to me, gentlemen, that we have it in our power to put an end to this campaign of radicalism.\u0027”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Think of it, think of it!” gasped Bates. “The old devil!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And then Duval chimed in, with a laugh, \u0027To put it in a nutshell, gentlemen, we are going to smash Ryder and scare the President!\u0027”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was the conference over?” asked Bates, after a moment\u0027s pause.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All but the hand-shakes,” said the other. “I didn\u0027t dare to stay while they were moving about.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Bates started suddenly to his feet. “Come!” he said. “We haven\u0027t any time to waste.
