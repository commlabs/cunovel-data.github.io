She pointed to her office though, using a stiff finger. She was pissed beyond speech. I saw Mom and Dad were already there, twin expressions of pissed off riding their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Gramps was there. He wasn\u0027t pissed, a slight smile curved his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy\u0027s eyes met mine from the floor, Sophie cradled like a fragile doll in his arms. God help the poor schmuck that would try to move her right now. We had a moment and then he gave me a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had it. His gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the most important thing to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my back on my friends and walked toward my family, my guts churning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re trying to be supportive, Caleb, really,\" Mom said, her elbows planted on the kitchen table, palms spread. She clenched them back together again and sighed. \"But you leave us no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were in tight fists by my side, my supper untouched in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps was scrubbing his face. He crossed his arms in front of him. I noticed that his plate was clean. Onyx lay covertly beside him, hoping for a morsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alicia,\" Gramps began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Pops. I need to handle this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s worked out so well, Peanut,\" he said levelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad sighed. \"Mom\u0027s right, you\u0027ve become more violent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph!\" Gramps cackled. \"In my day that little altercation would have been swept under the rug.\" He looked at the Parents steadily, his gray eyes darkening. \"This is part of becoming a man. Before everything got sissified, boys would hammer out their differences and move forward. Then, if you involve girls, well, it becomes even more important. Chen would do to think about that. She\u0027d probably cut down on the fights if she just let a few run their course.\" He folded his arms across his chest and flung out his legs in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hammer things out? What? with fists?\" Mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly and Dad sighed. \"Yes, if that\u0027s what needed doin\u0027, fists worked very well. Or kicks, or a ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mac,\" Dad said in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Mac said, realizing Mom was getting the Big Picture. Gramps turned his attention to me. \"That was some fine hand work, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Gramps,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued looking at me. \"Not bad on that other boy...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buddy,\" I supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it!\" he snapped his fingers. \"How old is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Senior,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe palmed his chin, raking his hand over the stubble. \"Seems older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s what Helen said,\" Mom remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He take judo too?\" Gramps asked, digging around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"He does something. I was havin\u0027 to bring it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pullin\u0027 out all the stops, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" Mom looked at all of us, \"Andrea is going to see this as a real problem. Jade\u0027s father is a known violent offender. She will see Caleb\u0027s actions in the worst possible light. And... I can\u0027t say I blame her.\" She narrowed her eyes on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted in my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Chen mentioned that Brett claimed that Jade\u0027s hand was hurt in the scuffle between you and Buddy. That he was just looking at her injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was calling bullshit on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to believe that, Ali, but given his track record with the boy... \" Dad shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps asked, \"What did Jade say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the thing, I hadn\u0027t had a chance to pulse and get things straight with her. \"I haven\u0027t pulsed her yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps stood, clapping his hands on his thighs. Onyx took that as his cue to jump on Gramps. He laughed and pushed him off gently. He looked at me. \"I was there at the school to bring you your wheels, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight! My car. Totally overshadowed by the crap at school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood and Dad put a restraining hand on my arm. I looked him in the eye. \"It\u0027s Jade or the car, Caleb. We have to begin to discipline you for this behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps hung his head, saying nothing, but shaking it in mild disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Gramps with an apologetic expression. \"The car. I\u0027d never let Jade go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless she let you go, Caleb,\" Mom said and I looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for that gem. Whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps clapped my back. \"It\u0027s okay, tiger. The car you can wait on, the girl won\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlad Gramps got it. My parents were certainly not there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left my supper cooling on the table as I followed Gramps outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst time ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitializing: Top Five Contact\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey- JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi... are you okay?-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esighs yeah... but, it was really scary today, Caleb.

I mean, I wasn\u0027t scared but it was scary with Sophie and all the fighting recently.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea knows, Caleb. She\u0027s totally not wanting me to go out with you now. It\u0027s like the whole thing, just... put her over the edge. She just sees my dad when this violent stuff happens.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotive stress evaluation medium I am nothing like your profanity-block dad!

He seriously wanted to see my wrist.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotive stress evaluation med-high you were hurt?-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! He thought he\u0027d seen my hand get hit when you and Buddy began... what... you did.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it. He just wanted an excuse to touch her. The interfering prick. I got an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did ya read off of him?CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause in pulse communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of stuff.

Dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdk exactly but it had a similar feel to the DI sample that\u0027s disappeared.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, that\u0027s all we needed was for Brett to pop some kind of murder. Just the thought of him having those ideas swirling around in his small brain made me tenser, knotting my muscles as my hand clenched the pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not the guy, Caleb.

Maybe she\u0027ll forget about it- JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoubt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK, we can try it.

I guess it could\u0027ve been worse.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of how Jade would be in school, unprotected. Felt pretty long to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess so doubtful- CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove you.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the day with Gramps, both of us freezing our butts off in the garage, going over the Camaro in detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to drive this without an idea of everything in it and how it all works. If we go over it with a fine tooth comb, you\u0027ll feel more confident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t tell Gramps I was already feeling okay about it. It was a car. It had been retrofitted with a pulse lock, that looked really weird on an old car, the black square of the pulse pad standing starkly against the white body paint. \"It\u0027s okay, Gramps. I think I got this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and Onyx ran over to stuff his nose in Gramps\u0027 hand until he pet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe petted him and Onyx thumped his leg on the concrete floor. Gramps gettin\u0027 the sweet spot pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood there quietly for a time and then Gramps asked, \"Where\u0027s Clyde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the thing that the Parents were also having a cow about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put him back to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you tell me that Parker said he wouldn\u0027t be able to go back anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"It was kinda like that. But, I don\u0027t know the details. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s any history here.\" I lifted my shoulders in an exaggerated shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precedence?\" Gramps asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Parker\u0027s it. Everything I know about corpse lore I get from him when he comes to do weird shit all over the top of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps didn\u0027t correct my language, lighting a cigarette instead. I raised an eyebrow. Mom was gonna crap a brick if she caught him smoking within a Mile of the Homestead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gramps... Mom\u0027s gonna rant if she sees you... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grocery store,\" he said in a flat voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"What? You got Mom-radar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled deeply and stabbed the last of the cigarette out in a old coffee can full of sand. He put the lid back on it and stuck it behind a bunch of car crap. It blended in perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSneaky for an old guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr just sneaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps looked at me through the filtered smoke of a new cig. Wiping his hands carefully on one of his car cloths from the endless supply in his back pocket, he said, \"the way I see it, you have a few problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I was pretty consistent in the predicament department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a finger. \"First, this Buddy character. He makes me nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my eyebrows jerk to my hairline. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a big drag on the smoke, the ash dangling at about an inch. He flicked it into the can again. It was a hugeass ashtray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrubbed his face with his free hand. After a hesitation he said, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he waved that away for the moment. \"Then there\u0027s the hoodlums. They\u0027re never gonna quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I got that. Totally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. Then, \"there\u0027s Clyde.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other for a pregnant moment. \"You have to figure out what to do with him. He\u0027s more than he was. He\u0027s not alive exactly but there\u0027s gonna come a time that he will evolve into something. Something that\u0027s dead but deserves to live. You got me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. I nodded. But I was sixteen years old. What was my responsibility here? I didn\u0027t even know where to begin with it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps saw my ambivalence. \"Chew on it, Caleb. You don\u0027t have to make some clear cut solution at this moment. But chaos will strike again and when it does, he\u0027ll come. Hell! He came to your defense when you were on the way back from my place,\" his gaze continued boring into me. \"Then, there\u0027s your girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke for the first time, \"What? What about Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems to get trouble attached to her like Velcro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s Velcro?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his hand, flicking ashes into the can. \"Never you mind. Sticky crap. Anyway, between that idiot Brett, her dad and,\" he paused, stabbing the blunt end of his smoke in my direction, \"her aunt... it\u0027s a challenge. A challenge to finesse around that aunt of hers, a challenge to protect her from her dad. And, to keep that brutal guy away from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s all that, Gramps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me. Finally, he said, \"You got a plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Mainly, I just react.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, barking out a laugh. \"Yeah, that makes sense, considering your age and the cloth you\u0027re cut from.\" He smiled, amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t really thinking it was so great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other through the veil of his smoke. No plan, both reactors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally judo was a chore I worked through. A skill to have because... well I needed it. Look at the last almost two years. But today, when Jade pulled up, the windshield winking at me in the sunlight, I jogged to the truck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-18.html","bookId":2492,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM"}
