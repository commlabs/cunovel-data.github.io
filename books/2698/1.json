In the West, once you got past the cities and out on the trails leading to the lands of the ranchers and homesteaders, the sound wasn\u0027t unusual. It was still eerie, but it wasn\u0027t unusual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was so early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after that, when the air went so very still...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Molly Fox knew that something was wrong, seriously wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew, who was generally a fine guard dog, was acting like anything but. He started to whine, tucked his tail between his legs and, keeping low to the ground, crept into the bedroom and under the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange silence continued. Molly listened, but she couldn\u0027t even hear the sound of the wind moving through the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking Lawrence\u0027s old rifle, she went out on the porch. As she stood there, she saw the dying sun far on the western horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she watched, it seemed to fall to the earth like a fiery globe, sending out tentacles of flame to tease the heavens. It was beautiful, but then, as if it had been enfolded in a dark blanket, it suddenly disappeared as it plummeted to the earth. The last vestiges of pink and pale yellow, mauve and silver, faded from the sky. Even twilight was gone; night had taken over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly stood in the darkness for a moment, then gave herself a shake and quickly retreated inside to light the kerosene lamp on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew was still cowering in the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come out, you ragamuffin,\" Molly called, though she was still illogically unnerved herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was accustomed to living out here. Lawrence and she had picked up stakes from Louisiana and come here to accept her inheritance from a father she\u0027d never met: a small cattle ranch, but not a very profitable one. Still, they had been able to hire five hands, who lived in the bunkhouse just the other side of the stables, and she even had a girl in from town to help her clean the place and keep up with the cooking, five days a week. They were young; they spent their nights dreaming and their days working hard to make those dreams a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was off on a cattle drive, like the one he had recently left on, Lawrence didn\u0027t like to leave her alone, and he\u0027d once suggested that they splurge for her to stay in town, but she hadn\u0027t wanted to go. He worried about a rogue cowhand or a rustler, or a plain old villain of any variety, who might come along. But she knew how to shoot, and she would hear a horseman coming. Plus she had Bartholomew-who at the very least made a terrible ruckus if there was a stranger around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t usually hide under the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly set about lighting the rest of the lamps in the parlor and dining area, kitchen, and even her bedroom-she didn\u0027t want Bartholomew spooked any further. Just moving around and doing something made her feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the wolves started howling again, and Molly heard Bartholomew whining softly in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bartholomew, you are not a hound, you are a chicken,\" Molly called to the dog, trying to find a semblance of inner calm. \"Those are just wolves, silly dog. Your cousins, in the grand scheme of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer own voice sounded unnatural to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even as the sound of her words died, she was listening again. And what she heard-or rather, didn\u0027t hear-was disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was back. A heavy silence that somehow just shouldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d left the gun by the door, and she quickly went back for it. Clutching the rifle with one hand, she carefully opened the front door again and walked back out on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing out there. The moon was rising high now-maybe the wolves had known it was on the rise, climbing up in the sky even as the sun had died in all its magnificent splendor. She could see the yard in front of the house, the strong fence Lawrence and the men had built, and the paddocks beyond. She had gone out earlier and fed the two horses that remained in the stables, along with the chickens, and she was glad-she didn\u0027t want to be far from the house now, or even Bartholomew, for whatever he was worth. She saw nothing, heard nothing, and yet she was afraid. She wished that she would hear the sound of hoofbeats or rowdy cowhands-or even outlaws; she could handle ill-mannered men, despite Lawrence\u0027s fears for her. She blushed. Lawrence was convinced that she was beautiful, and that, surely, everyone saw it. She prided herself more on an admirable sense of honor; she believed in God and believed that He wanted most for everyone to be decent to one another. Whenever she said so, though, Lawrence would shake his head, smiling, rolling his eyes, and tell her that she was naive. But she was still happy. He loved her. And he was such a gorgeous man himself. Tall and strong, and so capable; she even loved his callused hands, because he got those calluses working for her. For their dreams. But he did worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the respect and friendship of most folks in town; she certainly wasn\u0027t afraid of them. Not even of any of the local cowhands or farmers; she could quell their bad behavior with one disapproving look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she was never afraid....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly went from window to window, making sure they were all securely latched. The house had been built with a breezeway, Southern-style, so she went to the back door and assured herself that it was locked and latched, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the lamps were on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was still eerily silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set water on the stove to make herself a cup of tea. She had best get over this silliness, she told herself. It would be weeks before Lawrence returned from his cattle drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the water heated, she marched herself into her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew had come out from beneath the bed, but he was still crouched low, and he was making a strange whining sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barty, stop it!\" Molly implored. She went to her dressing table. The kerosene lamp set strange shadows to dancing around the room, something that didn\u0027t help her jitters. Her face appeared gaunt in the mirror, her hazel eyes reflecting back at her filled with a shimmering gold. Her hair caught the light and seemed to spark with fire, appearing more red than usual. She picked up her brush and began to count out a hundred strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew barked. She turned to look at him. \"Barty!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whined, and thumped his tail on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting out a sigh, she turned back to the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when she saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a startled scream, then turned with a gasp and relieved laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lawrence. Somewhere he had changed from his cattle-drive denims and cotton shirt; he was dashing in a black suit and crimson vest, and a high black silk hat. He was so straight and strong, such a handsome man. Cajun blood ran through him; his brows and neatly maintained mustache and beard were pitch-black, like his hair and eyes. His features were strong and his mouth was generous, his smile filled with a sense of fun and just a shade of wickedness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started toward him, then froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something wrong. His face was so pale. He lifted a hand, as if to keep her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly,\" he whispered. \"Molly, I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sick or injured, she thought; he looked as if he were about to fall. Filled with her love for him, she went to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? My God, Lawrence, how did you even get in here? I had the place all locked up. Never mind. What\u0027s wrong? Where are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped her arms around him, leading him to the foot of the bed. They sank down together, and he turned and stared at her. He had to be fevered, and yet he was cold to the touch. She brought her fingers to his face, tears springing to her eyes. \"My love, what\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking, he lifted his own hand to her face, his gaze intense as he told her, \"Molly, I love you. I love you so much. You are everything that I\u0027ve lived for, everything that\u0027s good and wonderful and pure in life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he kissed her, and though his lips were chilly at first, there was passion in his touch, and he seemed vibrant and vital and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperate...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her deeply, with a hunger that was seductive all in itself. The way that his tongue moved in her mouth was suggestive and wildly sexual. She felt his fingertips on her shoulder, tugging at the cotton of her blouse, and the fabric that ripped and tore as he removed it seemed of little consequence. He threw off his hat, lifting her higher on the bed, and the fever was in his eyes as he looked down at her, then buried his face against her throat, her breast. \"I love you. I love you so much. I shouldn\u0027t be here, but I have to be here. By God, I won\u0027t do another man ill, but I must be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threaded her fingers through his rich dark hair. \"I love you-I\u0027ll always love you-and you belong here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said something, but it was muffled against her flesh as he kissed her breasts, laved them with his tongue, teased them with his teeth, a small pain, but one that was oddly erotic. Their clothing wound up strewn everywhere, and she had never felt more feverishly, thoroughly kissed. He seemed to cover every inch of her body even as she struggled to return the liquid caresses, his urgency streaking through her with the fury of a lightning bolt. Somewhere in the back of her mind she still worried that he was ill. But he couldn\u0027t be that ill; no man could love with such steely passion if he were ill....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paid careful attention to all of her, first the entire length of her back, and then he flipped her over and caressed a slow and lazy zigzag pattern over her collarbone and breasts, down to her navel, her hips, her inner thighs, and then between them. She shrieked and clawed at him, and eventually brought him back to her. She couldn\u0027t have felt more loved and sensual and sexual than when he rose above her and thrust into her. He loved her with his body and with his very soul, and she was dazzled and flying, whispering, crying out, soaring higher and higher. When she climaxed, the world seemed to burst like Chinese firecrackers and then tremble as if they\u0027d been caught in an earthquake. Afterward, she clung to him, drifting back to sanity amid the shadows of their bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay still, catching her breath for the longest time, and then she curved into him and said, \"Lawrence, why are you back? You\u0027re not due for-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought his fingers to her lips. \"In time,\" he whispered. It almost sounded as if he were crying, but she didn\u0027t question him. She knew him well enough to know he would answer in his own time. They had grown up together, had spun their dreams for a life with each other forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her close for a long time, and then they made love again. Throughout, he whispered \"I love you\" so many times that she lost count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when she slept, it was in the comfort of his arms, basking in the love of their youth and their dreams for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the morning he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was amazed, disbelieving. She even went into town and asked if anyone had seen him. Sheriff Perkin looked at her as if she were plumb crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Molly, my dear, you know he\u0027s off on the trail with his hands. Honey, the man\u0027s barely left. He wouldn\u0027t be human if he\u0027d made it back here so fast, now would he? Are you sure you\u0027re all right out there? You\u0027re looking kind of peaked. You ought to come in and stay with my Susie. With our boys off helping on the cattle drive, she\u0027s right lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly thanked him but said that she couldn\u0027t stay. She went home, completely perplexed. Lawrence had been there on what she\u0027d come to call the night of the wolves, for that eerie howling. She knew it. She could still see his eyes, still hear his words, feel his touch. He loved her; he had made love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two days later when Doc Smith came out with the sheriff and his sweet wife, Susie. All three were pale and drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew something was wrong. She had actually known it from the moment she heard the horses\u0027 hoofbeats. She stood on the porch, clutching the rail as they approached. By her side, Bartholomew let out a low and mournful howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was afraid. More afraid than she\u0027d ever been in her life. And when the sheriff walked toward her, his old bulldog face filled with grief, she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she said. \"No, he\u0027s not dead. Lawrence isn\u0027t dead. He isn\u0027t, he isn\u0027t, he-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My poor dear!\" Susie Perkin, pretty and round, hurried to Molly, taking her into her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were attacked right outside town, just a few days after they left. Cattle rustlers, I\u0027m thinking, \u0027cause there wasn\u0027t sight nor sound of any cattle to be found,\" Sheriff Perkin said. \"Cattle rustlers...Comanche or Apache, most like. We can\u0027t rightly tell which. But there are some arrows at the site...some feathers, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Lawrence knew the local tribes and the shamans and the war chiefs. He didn\u0027t die at the hands of any Indians, I know that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc Smith was as kind a man as you could ever want to meet, and he took Molly\u0027s hand now. \"You\u0027ll come back into town with us,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Bartholomew, too,\" Sheriff Perkin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not dead. He was here! And he\u0027ll be back. Anytime now, he\u0027ll be back!\" Molly told them. She was falling, but they were there to support her. \"He was here, and that\u0027s why I asked you if you\u0027d seen him. He was home, but then he up and disappeared. He\u0027s not dead, though,\" Molly told them. \"And I won\u0027t believe he is. Not unless I see his body, I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord, she can\u0027t be seein\u0027 that body,\" Doc Smith whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not him. I know it\u0027s not. I don\u0027t care what you say, it\u0027s not him,\" Molly protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, there,\" Susie told her helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, they had to show her what was left of the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in Lawrence\u0027s clothing. It held Lawrence\u0027s pocket watch and his billfold. There was a gold chain around its neck with a big locket that carried a picture of her. The matted, bloody hair that remained was black. The body had been found with five others, and those men, she was certain, were their hands. Jody, who laughed all the time. Beau, who was big as an ox. Daryl, Steven and Jacob, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter insisting that she be allowed to see them all at the funeral parlor in town, Molly was horrified. At last it was more than her consciousness could bear. She passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she fell, she admitted that yes, the first man was Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately she told herself that no, it wasn\u0027t Lawrence. Lawrence had come to her, had made love to her, after this...thing was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about six weeks later when Molly knew for certain, at least in her own soul, that she had been right. She didn\u0027t know how; it was a mystery she would never fathom. But Lawrence had come to her that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was expecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rented her house and land to a neighboring rancher, and thanked the Perkins for all they had done for her, then told them that she couldn\u0027t stay, that she had to go home to what family she had, back to Louisiana, to the city. They wept when they saw her off in the stagecoach. She wept, too. They had been good friends. She knew they wanted her to stay, to fall in love again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she loved Lawrence. He loved her. And she would spend the rest of her life waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come once; he might come again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd meanwhile, she would have her child to raise. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-of-the-wolves-vampire-hunters-1/page-1.html","bookId":2698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM"}
