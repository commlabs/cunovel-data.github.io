With the river voicing its ceaseless roar fifteen paces to their left, the roughly shaped pavestones vanished beneath a black-stoned slide at the base of a moraine. Uprooted trees reached bent and twisted arms up through the rubble, jutting limbs from which hung root tendrils, dripping water. Swaths of forest climbed the mountainside to the north, on the other side of the river, and the ragged cliffs edging the tumbling wateron that side Were verdant with moss. The opposite mountain, flanking the trail, was a stark contrast, latticed with fissures, broken, gouged and mostly treeless. In the midst of this shattered facade shadows marked out odd regularities, of line and angle; and upon the trail itself, here and there, broad worn steps had been carved, eroded by flowing water and Centuries of footfalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac believed that a city had once occupied the entire mountainside, a vertical fortress carved into living stone. She could make out what she thought were large gaping windows, and possibly the fragmented ledges of balconies high up, hazy in the mists. Yet something-some-thing huge, terrible in its monstrosity-had impacted the entire side of the mountain, obliterating most of the city in a single blow. She could almost discern the outline of that collision, yet among the screes of rubble tracking down the sundered slopes the only visible stone belonged to the mountain itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood at the base of the trail. Seren watched the lifeless eyes of the Tiste Andii slowly scan upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well?’ she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin shook his head. ‘Not from my people. K ‘Chain Che’Malle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A victim of your war?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced across at her, as if gauging the emotion behind her question, then said, ‘Most of the mountains from which the K’Chain Che’Malle carved their sky keeps are now beneath the waves, inundated following the collapse of Omtose Phellack. The cities are cut into the stone, although only in the very earliest versions are they us you see here-open to the air rather than buried within shapeless rock.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘An elaboration suggesting a sudden need for self-defence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear Sengar had moved past them and was beginning the ascent. After a moment Udinaas and Kettle followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren had prevailed in her insistence to leave the horses behind. In a clearing off to their right sat four wagons covered with tarps. It was clear that no such contrivance could manage this climb, and all transport from here on was by foot. As for the mass of weapons and armour the slavers had been conveying, either it would have been stashed here, awaiting a hauling crew, or the slaves would have been burdened like mules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never made this particular crossing,’ Seren said, ‘although I have viewed this mountainside from a distance Even then, I thought I could see evidence of reshaping. I once asked Hull Beddict about it, but he would tell me nothing. At some point, however, I think our trail takes us inside.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The sorcery that destroyed this city was formidable,’ Silchas Ruin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps some natural force-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Acquitor. Starvald Demelain. The destruction was the work of dragons. Eleint of the pure blood. At least a dozen, working in concert, a combined unleashing of their warrens. Unusual,’ he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Which part?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Such a large alliance, for one. Also, the extent of thei: rage. I wonder what crime the K’Chaih Che’Malle committed to warrant such retaliation.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know the answer to that,’ came a sibilant whisper from behind them, and Seren turned, squinted down at the insubstantial wraith crouched there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wither. I was wondering where you had gone to.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Journeys into the heart of the stone, Seren Pedac. Into the frozen blood. What was their crime, you wonder, Silchas Ruin? Why, nothing less than the assured annihilation of all existence. If extinction awaited them, then so too would all else die. Desperation, or evil spite? Perhaps neither, perhaps a terrible accident, that wounding at the centre of it all. But what do we care? We shall all be dust by then. Indifferent. Insensate.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-19.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
