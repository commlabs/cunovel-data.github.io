His regard was languid in that lifeless way of his as he studied Bugg. ‘Did I hear you correctly?’ the advocate asked in a voice that he tried hard to make sibilant, but which instead came out awkward and wavering. The effect, Bugg realized with a faint start, precisely matched what he would imagine a snake would sound like with words emerging from a lip-less mouth. Although, he added to himself, the specific question hardly seemed one he would expect a snake to utter. Snakes don’t ask for clarification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wear a most odd expression,’ Sleem said after a moment. ‘Did my inability to understand you leave you confused, Master Bugg?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did you truly misunderstand?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is why I sought reiteration.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. Well, what did you think you heard?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes blinked. ‘Have we truly uttered all these words to return to my original query?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I invite you to use some more, Sleem.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rather than simply repeating yourself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I hate repeating myself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvocate Sleem, Bugg knew, despised discombobu-lation, although that was in all probability not even a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Master Bugg, as you know, I despise discombobulation.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You should be, since I charge by the word.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Both our words, or just yours?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is a little late to ask that now, isn’t it?’ Sleem’s folded hands did something sinuous and vaguely disreputable. ‘You have instructed me, if I understand you correctly-and correct me if I am in error-you have instructed me, then, to approach your financier to request yet another loan with the stated intention to use it to pay a portion of the interest on the previous loan, which if I recall accurately, and I do, was intended to address in part the interest on yet another loan. This leads me to wonder, since I am not your only advocate, just how many loans you have arranged to pay interest on yet other loans?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, that was expensive.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I become loquacious when I get nervous, Master Bugg.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Dealing with you gets more costly when you’re nervous? That, Sleem, is really quite clever.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, I am. Will you now answer my question?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Since you insist. There are perhaps forty loans outstanding with respect to addressing interest payments on still other loans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advocate licked suitably dry lips. ‘It was reasons of courtesy and respect, Master Bugg-and, I now see, certain misapprehensions as to your solvency-that encouraged me to refrain from asking for payment up front-for my services, that is, which have been substantial. Although not as substantial, proportionately, as I was led to believe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t recall leading you into any such assumptions, Sleem.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course you don’t. They were assumptions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As an advocate, you might have been expected to make very few assumptions indeed. About anything.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Permit me to be blunt, Master Bugg. Where in this financial scheme of yours is the money you owe me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nowhere as of yet, Sleem. Perhaps we should arrange another loan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This is most distressing,’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am sure it is, but how do you think I feel?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am resisting asking myself that question, because I fear the answer will be something like: “He feels fine.” Now, were I to cling with great faith to those particular assumptions we spoke of earlier, I would now insist that this next loan be devoted exclusively to addressing my fees. No matter what lies I deliver to your financier. Which returns us, alas, to my original utterance, which was voiced in a tone of abject disbelief. You see, your financiers’ present state of panic is what has brought me here, for they have reached a level of harassment of my office with respect to you, Master Bugg, that has reached absurd proportions. I have had to hire bodyguards, in fact-at your expense. Dare I ask you then, how much money is in your possession?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg drew out his tattered leather purse, prised it open and peered inside. Then he looked up. ‘Two docks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see. Surely you exaggerate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, I cut a sliver off one of them, to pay for a haircut.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have no hair.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-306.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
