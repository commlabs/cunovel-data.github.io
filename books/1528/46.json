Water gurgled and echoed on the far side. A natural spring poured out of a knee-high hole in the wall and flowed through a crack in the floor, then vanished out the opposite wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Harappan well cave,” Elizabeth said, recognizing the configuration. “Living alongside the Indus River, the civilization grew skilled at irrigation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shone his light around the space. It was crudely circular. Cut into the stone floor was another chakra wheel. But the center of this one wasn’t empty. A large egg-shaped stone rested there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a copy of the omphalos,” Elizabeth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and the others were drawn to it. It stood as high as her midriff and was twice as large as the one from the Delphi museum. The dome’s outer surface was carved with trees and leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth swallowed hard and stared around her. “Someone has re-created the original adytum, the inner sanctum of the Oracle, where she cast her prophecies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stepped over to a toppled bronze chair. It had three legs. “Here’s a tripod. The classical seat of the Oracle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or oracles.” Gray had wandered a few steps away. He pointed his flashlight to more toppled chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth snapped several pictures. What was this place? What was it doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosauro called from the wall, hiking up her pack. “You might want to see this,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca stood farther down the wall. His arm was raised to the surface, but not touching. Even in the shadows, Elizabeth noted how his hand shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth crossed to Rosauro. A mosaic, nearly black with age, covered the wall. Several tiles littered the floor, fallen away. Someone had wiped sections of the mosaic down, removing centuries of mold and grime. It looked hastily done. Elizabeth imagined her father swabbing a cloth over the artwork, seeking what lay beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at what was revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom floor to ceiling, it depicted a siege on a temple set amid mountains. “Parnassus,” Elizabeth mumbled. “Under attack by Romans. It’s showing the downfall of the Temple of Delphi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next section revealed a room not unlike the one they were in, even with an omphalos in the center—but the stone was shown in cross section. Hidden beneath its dome crouched a small girl, cradled in the arms of a young woman, curled tight together as a Roman soldier searched for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth glanced to the stone behind her. It couldn’t be…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped along the wall. The next tableaux revealed a caravan of horses, donkeys, and carts. At the head of the train, the same slender woman led the child. The long caravan climbed up and over a mountain. The last cart was hauled by two fiery stallions, clearly representing the steeds who drew Apollo’s sun chariot across the skies. But they were not dragging the sun here. In the back of the cart rested the same stone that had protected the woman and child. The omphalos of Delphi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth turned and faced the stone behind her. She trembled all over. “That’s not a copy,” she said with a shudder. “That’s the original omphalos. The one spoken of in the histories of Plutarch and Socrates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And see this,” Rosauro said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman drew Elizabeth to the next scene. It was a picture of the canyon, a joyous scene of the Greeks building temples into the cliffs. The adytum was also depicted, but instead of one Oracle seated atop a tripod, there were five. They circled the omphalos, which smoked like a volcano from the hole at its top. The smoke formed a figure of a young boy with outstretched arms. His eyes were fire, and flames climbed from his open palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the boy indicative of prophecy in general or something more specific?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, Elizabeth found those fiery eyes staring back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her shoulder, Gray had also followed the story. He waved an arm along the wall, encompassing the tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last Oracle, the child, must have been spirited away after the downfall of the temple. In secret, the Greek temple guardians and supporters fled the Roman persecution and settled here, where they rebuilt among these Harappan ruins, and stayed hidden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth remembered Abe’s story of this place. “They remained safe for seven hundred years, perhaps intermingling with the local tribes in secret. And after so many generations, the Greeks were slowly absorbed into the Indian culture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then they grew afoul of religious persecution and the growing Indian caste system,” Gray said. “All the bones. A massacre occurred here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca spoke at the end of the wall. “And they fled again,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey joined him. He stood a step from the churning spring. The art here was not mosaic tiles, but someone had painted a hurried frieze. It was done in black paint, showing the attack of the temples. People fled in all directions, but one group, highlighted by radiant streaks, escaped in a caravan of tall wagons with large wheels. It faded smaller and smaller across the wall, heading far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca placed his fingers gently to the wagons. His voice cracked with emotion. “These are our people,” he said. “The Romani. This is where we came from. This is our origin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shifted back. He stared across the wall, his face stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek guardians escaped with the last child and the omphalos, hiding in this valley and absorbing over the span of seven centuries into Indian culture, then that same culture persecuted them and sent them wandering once again, but under a new name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGypsies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray waved an arm to encompass the wall. “The story depicted here must trace a genetic line that has been preserved throughout history. Flowing from Greece, to here, and out again. A genetic line of savant power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is why we wander,” Luca said, still staring at the caravan. “As the Hindu man said, no place is safe forever. So we kept moving, trying to protect the secret held within the heart of our clans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until the secret was stolen from you,” Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A secret that trails all the way back to Delphi,” Elizabeth added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pictured the child back in Washington. Could she truly be a descendant of the last Oracle of Delphi?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosauro stepped to the fresco and pointed to the lines of other figures fleeing the besieged complex in various directions. “These refugees,” she said to Elizabeth. “This must be why your father found all the genetic trails led to this region, why the markers are so concentrated in this area, especially among the lower castes. It’s where the refugees were absorbed into the populace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they talked, Gray had crossed down the wall one more time, studying each image more closely. He came to the last mosaic, the one with the fiery boy. “There’s writing below here,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stepped closer. There were three lines. The topmost was a handsome line of Harappan script, the next line Sanskrit, the last Greek. Below the lines rested another chakra wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t read the Harappan hieroglyphics,” she said. “No one can. And below that, I can make out only the first few words of the Sanskrit and Greek. The rest has been worn away. What I can translate, reads ‘the world will burn…’” She took some snapshots, especially of the fiery figure. “The rest is lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray leaned lower and touched the chakra wheel inscribed below the lines. “This must be important. It’s repeated over and over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened and turned toward the larger chakra wheel carved into the floor. The omphalos rested at its center. Elizabeth could almost read Gray’s mind. If the chakra was important, then what lay at its center must be doubly so. The man’s eyes narrowed as he stalked over to the stone. They’d only given it a cursory glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father hid the skull inside the stone at the museum. Maybe there was a reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray climbed on top of the domed omphalos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful,” Elizabeth squeaked out, fearful of marring the piece of ancient history. She circled the stone and noted the bottom rim was inscribed with three languages again: Harappan, Sanskrit, and Greek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took more pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalancing on top of the omphalos, Gray shone his light down through the hole and into its hollow heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you see?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gold…in the shape of two eagles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth’s breath shortened. “Are they facing away from each other?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray glanced back to her. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s another lost artifact from Delphi, representing Zeus’s eagles. According to mythology, the pair was sent in opposite directions from his shoulders to pinpoint the center of the world. They came to roost at Delphi, marking the navel of the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father surely must have found them, too.” Gray reached inside. “Maybe there’s some reason they’re hidden here, the same reason your father hid the skull in the omphalos at the museum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he strained, Elizabeth edged around the stone, continuing her translation of the three lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I can reach them…,” Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth mumbled the words found there, tracing each letter with her finger. “‘Greed and blasphemy bring doom to all.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it,” Gray said as he reached the golden idols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth snapped straight. “Don’t!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Gray slipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething loud thumped inside the stone, followed by a thunderous crack underfoot. A low roar followed, coming from the rear of the chamber, growing in volume, like a freight train barreling toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone froze for a breath, then Gray shoved an arm toward the stairs. “Everybody out!” he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the spring’s hole, an explosion of water blasted out with the power of a fire hose—in a column two feet thick. Fissures skittered across the wall, radiating out from the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man-made flash flood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water smashed against the far wall and swept into the room, knocking them all off their feet with the force of its current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth tangled into the others as the room swelled rapidly with icy water. Gray nabbed her elbow and dragged her toward the stairs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-46.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
