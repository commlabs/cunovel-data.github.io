A BELL-BOY\u0027S EXPERIENCES.","content":"\u0026nbsp;It was evident that the guest whom Rupert had conducted to his room was a maniac of the most dangerous character. The man\u0027s face was terrible to look upon. His small, ferret-like eyes seemed to dilate with ferocious cunning. He was a man not perhaps robust or strong, but too strong for a boy of sixteen. And Rupert was alone with him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was terrible to think that he was to become the victim of such a man.

It is advisable to humor his delusions. Fortunately he had read a story recently in which a man had escaped death by this very means. It was a desperate chance, but Rupert resolved[Pg 94] to make use of it. Instead of showing the fear he really felt, he forced himself to appear calm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are mistaken,\" he said; \"the boy you are to sacrifice is under the bed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The maniac was just about to lunge with his knife, but Rupert\u0027s words made him pause.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look under the bed and you will see him,\" continued the bell-boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The bed was at the other end of the room.

He sprang to the door, turned the key, but did not dare to stop to lock it on the outside, and dashed into the entry. The door of the next room chanced to be open.

The maniac, discovering the ruse, rose to his feet, and, knife in hand, ran into the hall with a blood-curdling cry. He looked in vain for Rupert, who was nowhere to be seen. The staircase was near. He ran down, flight after flight, till[Pg 95] he reached the office floor, and made a great sensation as he dashed through it with his drawn knife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here, however, he had some one more formidable than a boy to contend with. Two burly porters sprang upon him, and felled him to the floor.

He heard his unpleasant acquaintance leaving the adjoining room, but was apprehensive that he might return. At length he heard some one calling, \"Rupert, where are you?\" and recognized it as the voice of one of the other bell-boys.
