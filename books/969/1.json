I want you to know better what sort of animals donkeys really are, and so I have written for you this story of my life. You will see, my dear little Master, that we donkeys have been, and still are, often badly treated by human beings. We are often very nice indeed; but I must also confess that in my youth I sometimes behaved very badly, and you will see how I was punished for it, and how unhappy I was, and how at last I repented, and how at last my repentance changed me and gained for me the forgiveness of my friends and masters. So, when you have read my history, you won’t say any more “as stupid as a donkey,” or “as obstinate as a donkey,” but “as sensible as a donkey,” “as clever as a donkey,” or “as gentle as a donkey.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hee-haw! my dear little Master, hee-haw! I hope you will never be as I was when I was young.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I remain,\n\u003cbr\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1852/53647.html","bookId":969,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:54:57 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:54:57 PM"}
