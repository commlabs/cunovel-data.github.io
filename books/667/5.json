{"id":40278,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V THE CIPHER CODE","content":"On the morning of July 4 the sun rose in a cloudless sky above the mountains, and the atmosphere was so clear that the most remote objects were unusually distinct. The conditions were so favorable for signaling that, after a hurried breakfast, the three soldiers hastened to the point on the ridge which they had selected for a station. Corporal Bromley took position with a red flag having a large white square in the center, and this he waved slowly from right to left, while Lieutenant Coleman adjusted his spy-glass, resting it upon a crotched limb which he had driven into the ground; and at his left Philip sat with a note-book and pencil in hand, ready to take down the letters as Lieutenant Coleman called them off. There are but three motions used in signaling. When the flag from an upright position is dipped to the right, it signifies 1; to the left, 2; and forward, 3. The last motion is used only to indicate that the end of the word is reached. Twenty-six combinations of the figures 1 and 2 stand for the letters of the alphabet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"CORPORAL BROMLEY TOOK POSITION WITH A RED FLAG HAVING A LARGE WHITE SQUARE IN THE CENTER.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"CORPORAL BROMLEY TOOK POSITION WITH A RED FLAG\n\u003cbr\u003e HAVING A LARGE WHITE SQUARE IN THE CENTER.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is not an easy task to learn to send messages by these combinations of the figures 1 and 2, and it is harder still to read the flags miles away through the telescope. The three soldiers had had much practice, however, and could read the funny wigwag motions like print. If any two boys care to learn the code, they can telegraph to each other from hill to hill, or from farm to farm, as well as George and Philip. You will see that the vowels and the letters most used are made with the fewest motions—as, one dip of the flag to the left (2) for I, and one to the right (1) for T. Z is four motions to the right (1111); and here is the alphabet as used in the signal-service:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; A,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 11,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; O,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 12,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; B,\u0026nbsp; 1221,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; P,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 2121,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; C,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 212,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Q,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 2122,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; D,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 111,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; R,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 122,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; E,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 21,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; S,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 121,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; F,\u0026nbsp; 1112,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; T,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 1,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; G,\u0026nbsp; 1122,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; U,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 221,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; H,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 211,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; V,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 2111,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; I,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 2,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; W,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 2212,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; J,\u0026nbsp; 2211,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; X,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 1211,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; K,\u0026nbsp; 1212,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Y,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 222,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; L,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 112,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Z,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 1111,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; M,\u0026nbsp; 2112,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026amp;,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 2222,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; N,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 22,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; ing,\u0026nbsp; 1121,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; tion, 2221.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the flag stops at an upright position, it means the end of a letter—as, twice to the right and stop (11) means A; one dip forward (3) indicates the end of a word; 33, the end of a sentence; 333, the end of a message. Thus 11-11-11-3 means \"All right; we understand over here; go ahead\"; and 11-11-11-333 means \"Stop signaling.\" Then 212-212-212-3 means \"Repeat; we don\u0027t understand what you are signaling\"; while 12-12-12-3 means \"We have made an error, and if you will watch we will give the message to you correctly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, if Lieutenant Coleman wanted to say to another signal-officer \"Send one man,\" the sentence would read in figures, \"121, 21, 22, 111, 3, 12, 22, 21, 3, 2112, 11, 22, 33.\" But in time of war the signalmen of the enemy could read such messages, and so each party makes a cipher code of its own, more or less difficult; and the code is often changed. So if Lieutenant Coleman\u0027s cipher code was simply to use for each letter sent the fourth letter later in the alphabet, his figures would have been quite different, and the letters they stood for would have read:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; W-i-r-h s-r-i q-e-r.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; S-e-n-d o-n-e m-a-n.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, after fifteen minutes of waiting, during which time the flag in Corporal Bromley\u0027s hand made a great rustling and flapping in the wind, moving from side to side, Lieutenant Coleman got his glass on the other flag, ten miles away, and found it was waving 11-11-11-3—\"All right.\" Corporal Bromley then sent back the same signal, and sat down on the bank to rest. What Lieutenant Coleman saw at that distance was a little patch of red dancing about on the object-glass of his telescope; he could not see even the man who waved it, or the trees behind him. Promptly at Bromley\u0027s signal \"All right,\" the little object came to a rest; and when it presently began again, Lieutenant Coleman called off the letters, which Philip repeated as he entered them in the book. For an hour and a half the messages continued repeating all the mass of figures which had come over the line during the last three days.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the mountain of the nineteenth red pin had said its say as any parrot might have done, for it was absolutely ignorant of the meaning of the figures it received and passed on (for the reason that it had no officer with the cipher), Lieutenant Coleman took from his pocket a slip of paper on which he had already arranged his return message to Chattanooga. When this had been despatched, the lieutenant took the note-book from Philip, and went away to his tent to cipher out the meaning of the still meaningless letters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were sufficiently eager to get the latest news, for they knew that the army they had just left had been advancing its works and fighting daily since the twenty-second day of June for the possession of Kenesaw Mountain. The despatches were translated in the order in which they came, so that it was a good half-hour before Lieutenant Coleman appeared with a radiant face to say that General Sherman had taken possession of Kenesaw Mountain on the day before. \"And that is not all,\" he cried, holding up his hand to restrain any premature outburst of enthusiasm. \"Listen to this! \u0027The \"Alabama\" was sunk by the United States steamer \"Kearsarge\" on the nineteenth day of June, three miles outside the harbor of Cherbourg, on the coast of France.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corporal Bromley was not a demonstrative man, yet the blood rushed to his face, and there was a glittering light in his eyes which told how deeply the news touched him; but Philip, on the contrary, was wild with delight, and danced and cheered and turned somersaults on the grass.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1994/57046.html","bookId":667,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:46:26 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:46:26 PM"}
