{"id":15796,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"He was running, running down the long tunnels, the shadows hunting him, claws clutching at him, nearer ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the waiting windless dark, Lewis Stillman pressed into the building-front shadows along Wilshire Boulevard. Breathing softly, the automatic poised and ready in his hand, he advanced with animal stealth toward Western, gliding over the night-cool concrete, past ravaged clothing shops, drug and ten-cent stores, their windows shattered, their doors ajar and swinging. The city of Los Angeles, painted in cold moonlight, was an immense graveyard; the tall white tombstone buildings thrust up from the silent pavement, shadow-carved and lonely. Overturned metal corpses of trucks, busses and automobiles littered the streets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He paused under the wide marquee of the FOX WILTERN. Above his head, rows of splintered display bulbs gaped—sharp glass teeth in wooden jaws. Lewis Stillman felt as though they might drop at any moment to pierce his body.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Four more blocks to cover. His destination: a small corner delicatessen four blocks south of Wilshire, on Western. Tonight he intended bypassing the larger stores like Safeway or Thriftimart, with their available supplies of exotic foods; a smaller grocery was far more likely to have what he needed. He was finding it more and more difficult to locate basic food stuffs. In the big supermarkets only the more exotic and highly spiced canned and bottled goods remained—and he was sick of caviar and oysters!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Crossing Western, he had almost reached the far curb when he saw some of them. He dropped immediately to his knees behind the rusting bulk of an Olds 88. The rear door on his side was open, and he cautiously eased himself into the back seat of the deserted car. Releasing the safety catch on the automatic, he peered through the cracked window at six or seven of them, as they moved toward him along the street. God! Had he been seen? He couldn\u0027t be sure. Perhaps they were aware of his position! He should have remained on the open street where he\u0027d have a running chance. Perhaps, if his aim were true, he could kill most of them; but, even with its silencer, the gun would be heard and more of them would come. He dared not fire until he was certain they discovered him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They came closer, their small dark bodies crowding the walk, six of them, chattering, leaping, cruel mouths open, eyes glittering under the moon. Closer. The shrill pipings increased, rose in volume. Closer. Now he could make out their sharp teeth and matted hair. Only a few feet from the car ... His hand was moist on the handle of the automatic; his heart thundered against his chest. Seconds away ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lewis Stillman fell heavily back against the dusty seat-cushion, the gun loose in his trembling hand. They had passed by; they had missed him. Their thin pipings diminished, grew faint with distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tomb silence of late night settled around him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The delicatessen proved a real windfall. The shelves were relatively untouched and he had a wide choice of tinned goods. He found an empty cardboard box and hastily began to transfer the cans from the shelf nearest him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A noise from behind—a padding, scraping sound.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lewis Stillman whirled around, the automatic ready.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A huge mongrel dog faced him, growling deep in its throat, four legs braced for assault. The blunt ears were laid flat along the short-haired skull and a thin trickle of saliva seeped from the killing jaws. The beast\u0027s powerful chest-muscles were bunched for the spring when Stillman acted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The gun, he knew, was useless; the shots would be heard. Therefore, with the full strength of his left arm, he hurled a heavy can at the dog\u0027s head. The stunned animal staggered under the blow, legs buckling. Hurriedly, Stillman gathered his supplies and made his way back to the street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How much longer can my luck hold? Lewis Stillman wondered, as he bolted the door. He placed the box of tinned goods on a wooden table and lit the tall lamp nearby. Its flickering orange glow illumined the narrow, low-ceilinged room as Stillman seated himself on one of three chairs facing the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Twice tonight, his mind told him, twice you\u0027ve escaped them—and they could have seen you easily on both occasions if they had been watching for you. They don\u0027t know you\u0027re alive. But when they find out ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He forced his thoughts away from the scene in his mind away from the horror; quickly he stood up and began to unload the box, placing the cans on a long shelf along the far side of the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He began to think of women, of a girl named Joan, and of how much he had loved her ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The world of Lewis Stillman was damp and lightless; it was narrow and its cold stone walls pressed in upon him as he moved. He had been walking for several hours; sometimes he would run, because he knew his leg muscles must be kept strong, but he was walking now, following the thin yellow beam of his hooded lantern. He was searching.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2405/66929.html","bookId":557,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:15:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:15:35 AM"}
