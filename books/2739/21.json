This stuff feels like glue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eat the last bite of my sandwich and finish the Diet Coke while he smokes. I fiddle with the wrapper, wad it up and balance it on top of the empty can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been running, while I was gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him. “I skipped one day, but I ran today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was planning to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind if I join you? I haven’t done so much as a pushup since we ran last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PA pokes his head out the door. “Five minutes, Emma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of filming, Graham leaves the set without speaking to anyone but Richter. I want to talk to him again, but I feel so guilty over kissing Reid that I lose my nerve any time I consider initiating a conversation. And then I think of Brooke, and I’m not sure if I have anything to feel guilty for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid: Hey, just thinking about you and wanted to say hi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Hi back. Having fun? Using sunscreen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid: Yes… and yes... but after that many hours in the sun, I may come back saturday a little pinker anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Lol. See you then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid: Hope so ;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREID\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke got one thing right: river whores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m talking about the guys and me, of course. The past two days have consisted of watching for hours as groups of girls float nearby with their tubes hooked together, clad in bikinis and frayed denim shorts with straw cowboy hats or baseball caps shielding their faces. Last night was after-hours partying and inviting a few girls (and a couple of guys—Tadd’s no more angelic than the rest of us) back to the cottages. Being on this river the past couple of days, I remember what made Brooke so fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew up in LA, and thanks to a multitude of factors including Dad’s career trajectory, Mom’s ancestry, and their collective net worth, I’ve run in exclusive circles my whole life. The majority of women in those circles of southern California, and their daughters, have a look. An untouchable beauty, a not-quite-real quality, everything pampered and flawless. My mother has this look, as do her friends. The socialites, the actresses, the wannabes, they all have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I met Brooke, she was fifteen and new to California. She’d been discovered in Texas—in Austin, in fact, and she was so raw and fresh and different, she took my breath away. She was beautiful, but natural. Her hair wasn’t highlighted, and she wore no makeup off set. She had tan lines from laying out at the community pool and muscles from playing soccer since she was five. Since she’d grown up in a relatively large city, her accent was mild, but definitely there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d confessed that her manager was sending her to speech classes to lose her “horrible drawl.” I remember telling her that was the most idiotic thing I’d ever heard, but when I begged her not to go, she’d laughed and said, “You don’t want me to sound like some brainless hick, do you?” That was just the first thing LA changed about her. Now she’s as perfect and soulless as the others there. Not that I can talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls here all have her former accent, in various concentrations. In some, every other word is y’all. Others just soften syllables and liaise words. All of them tend to drop any g at the end of any word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few of them figured out who we are. Not difficult when we’re all together like this, which is what had Bob freaked out. When I’m outside LA by myself or with John, I sometimes get away with saying, “Yeah, I get that all the time,” if someone discovers who I am. With Quinton and Tadd along, it’s nearly impossible. Hats and sunglasses help, but a few people know our identities despite the camouflage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I need in my campaign to win Emma over all the way is photos of me with other girls popping up tomorrow on the Internet. Wherever there are cameras, or wherever cameras might be, I’m doing no more than hanging out with the guys, maybe a little drinking, a little dancing. Anyone following me into the cottage is subject to leaving all personal items with Jeff and Ricky. One girl objected, which was no big deal—Ricky just escorted her back to her friends’ campsite. Her friend, on the other hand, surrendered her bag and phone to Jeff and asked if she needed to give him her clothes, too. I told her no, she and I would take care of that ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what, exactly, are the boys doing?” MiShaun asks over dinner Friday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They went tubing.” Brooke answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon me?” MiShaun says, one eyebrow raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A shallow, slow-moving river, inner tubes—like from tires—and a day of doing nothing but floating downstream. Add beer and girls in bikinis and it’s a guy’s wet dream. Ha, ha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like a guaranteed sunburn to me,” Jenna says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiShaun agrees. “Richter will have their hides if they come back looking like well-done lobsters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, are you Brooke Cameron? From Life’s a Beach?” Two girls stand hesitantly by our table, apprehensive but determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke turns, a wide smile replacing her blasé expression. “Yes, I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, we love you!” the second girl says while the first nods. “You’re so bitchy and awesome!” Both girls blanch. “I mean, I know Kirsten is just your character, that you aren’t really, uh—.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry—I strive for bitchy and awesome.” She laughs and they relax. “Would you like to take a picture or something?” A whirlwind of activity occurs as the two fans dig their phones out of their bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of us slide looks towards each other that say Who is this person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Jenna takes a photo of Brooke with one of her fans, the other girl glances around the table. “Ohmigod, MiShaun Grant! Wow, you guys are friends? That’s so cool!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re in Austin filming a movie,” Brooke says, motioning for the second girl to get into the photo Jenna is about to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are?” That’s when they recognize me. I don’t know if they think they’re being subtle, or if they don’t care. They stare and whisper behind their hands. “Wait. Hold on. Are you talking about the movie with Reid Alexander?” Both girls scan the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Brooke says, a new edge to her voice. “And he’s not here.” Meredith and I exchange another look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir disappointment is palpable. “Can we at least get a photo with you, too?” one of them asks MiShaun, who flashes Meredith and me a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure thing. Always happy to do impromptu photo ops with my adoring fans.” Her sarcastic tone is gently veiled by the words. Meredith bites the inside of her cheek and examines her silverware as I cough-laugh into my napkin. MiShaun leans towards the fans, smiling, while Jenna snaps the photos. The photo requests are repeated with me, and suddenly I can hardly wait to get back to the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You girls have a nice evening,” Brooke dismisses the two girls and turns back to Jenna as though they’d been interrupted in the middle of a scintillating conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God,” Brooke says as they walk away, “Reid’s a pain in the ass even when he isn’t around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREID\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn’s CEO father called last night and ordered him home. Apparently he has orientation for college starting Monday morning, and he’s supposed to check in tomorrow. Oops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how loud and intimidating my dad is, he doesn’t compare to John’s dad, a CEO who handles everyone he encounters, no matter who they are, as though they work for him. That includes John, who nicknamed him the Dark Lord when we were sixteen. John doesn’t work and is completely financially dependent, so when the Dark Lord says jump, he jumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn and I are sharing one of the cottages, and he knocked on my bedroom door at, shall we say, aninopportune moment last night. The girl—let’s call her Macy because I like that name and I can’t recall her real name—shot up like she’d been hit with a jumper cable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus. What?” I called, annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey man, a minute,” John said on the other side of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Macy, who was mostly undressed but looked like she might bolt. “Don’t move.” I put one finger on her sternum and pushed her slowly back down, smiling. “It’s just my dumbass friend. I’ll be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI padded across the small room, shirtless, jeans unzipped, and cracked open the door. “What the hell do you want, man? I know you had more condoms that you could use in a week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad just called. I, uh, have to be home tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On a ten a.m. flight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Why?” I shook my head. “Nevermind. I’ll text Jeff—God knows I’m not disturbing him right now. He’d kick your ass, only because he’s not allowed to kick mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that’s kinda why I didn’t knock on his door…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll handle it. Now leave me the hell alone the rest of the night. Seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “Don’t worry, man. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” I shut the door with a snap, locked it and turned, grabbing my phone from the rickety dresser and tapping a message to Jeff, Tadd and Quinton as I walked towards the bed, staring at Macy. “Where were we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a flurry of activity this morning to get out of here before eight. Macy’s just been coaxed into one of three taxis, looking severely hungover and pouting that I’m leaving. There’s no reason to tell her that my leaving has nothing to do with putting her in a taxi this morning. No offense to hot girls everywhere—but newsflash—there are hot girls everywhere. I don’t do seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not including Emma with that—she’s not a one-nighter. I assume she’ll keep me happily occupied for the duration of filming. Maybe longer, who knows. If you mess around with costars, there’s generally an assumption of being a couple, at least temporarily. I don’t believe in love, and even though my parents have been married forever, I don’t believe in marriage either. They just exist and rotate around each other’s lives. There’s no emotional relationship there. It’s a social, fiscal relationship. That’s not for me and never will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t lie to girls like Macy (whose name is Tracy, by the way—I was close). If she goes into something like last night assuming a relationship might come out the other end—and I don’t care if we’re talking about me or John or any guy—she’s fooling herself. It has nothing to do with a lack of respect or any of that shit they try to scare girls with. It’s way more simple than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I met you last night, and brought you back to my place, or followed you to yours, and we had sex, that’s what we asked for from each other. It’s what I got, and what you got. I don’t know you. You don’t know me. Thanks for playing, and we’re done. If by some fluke anything was said at some point during this entire exchange that made me curious enough to see you again, I would. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/between-the-lines-between-the-lines-1/page-21.html","bookId":2739,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:12 PM"}
