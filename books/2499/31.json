He took care not to look Idelfonzuz in the face, for such an affront to a King by a servant was punishable by death. \"I will bring my master directly,\" he said at his most subservient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am eager to see him. I know you did not arrive in Toledom until sunset last night, but I cannot afford to wait on the ceremony of three days before I speak with him,\" he declared, striding down the room as if practicing for conquest on the field. It was late in a hot afternoon, and so he had dressed in a light-weight cote of rust-colored linen with only a minimal damask auburn surcote over it, and still he was sweating; his beard and hair were newly trimmed and he wore only a gold circlet on his brow to show his rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will hurry,\" said Ruthor, and made his way down the gallery toward the study with its observatory in the ceiling. There he found Germanno showing Lailie the books stored there, and the place where writing materials were kept. \"My master,\" he said, knowing he was interrupting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Ruthor?\" Germanno said, turning around; beside him Lailie looked up, a touch of anxiety in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The King is here. He intends to speak with you.\" He nodded to Lailie. \"Perhaps it would be more sensible if you were to come to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruthor, old friend, you are the master of tact. Certainly it would be...more sensible.\" He stepped away from the trestle table and said to her, \"Do as you like while I am gone. There is nothing you cannot open in this room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ducked her head, showing her hair was still bound up from traveling; her mantel of Sicilian silk was as fashionable in Toledom as it had been in Sevallis. \"You are very kind, Comide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a little reverence in her direction and then left the study. \"Why on earth is Idelfonzuz here? I should have visited him in three days, as required.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he does not have time to wait,\" said Ruthor. \"He seems impatient, even for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That does not reassure me,\" said Germanno. \"What can have happened to make him behave so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He would not tell me, my master,\" said Ruthor, so neutrally that Germanno turned to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then more fool he, old friend,\" said Germanno as they turned and entered the gallery that led to the main hall. \"If you will go to the kitchens and have something suitable sent up? A jar of wine, as well, I think. Idelfonzuz puts great store in such niceties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it takes me out of his way,\" said Ruthor. \"I will tend to this at once,\" he said, and slipped away toward the kitchens, leaving Germanno to greet the King on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntering the main hall, Germanno made a deep reverence to Idelfonzuz, such as he might offer the Emperor in Constantinople. \"What honor to me and my house, Liege, that you visit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comide Ragoczy,\" said Idelfonzuz, flattered by the distinction Germanno had shown him. \"How good to have you here in Toledom again.\" He smiled briefly, then addressed the reason for his visit. \"I am planning my campaign to take control of the disputed regions to the east. You may advise me on what the Moors will do when I move my men into Usxa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not need me to tell you they will fight,\" said Germanno, a bit nonplussed by this obvious situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That they will. But whom will they fight?\" He paused and arched his brows. \"My informers tell me that there are demons in the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGermanno nodded. \"Yes. Antoninus said much the same thing.\" He then repeated all that he had been told, adding when he was through, \"I must tell you, Liege, that I do not place much confidence in rumors. Most of them turn out to be unfounded, and those that have a grain of truth are-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, yes,\" said Idelfonzuz, waving his hand to dismiss the matter. \"And Antoninus can turn a pair of mules into a mounted company of horsemen.\" He walked away a short distance, then came back. \"Still, those mountains have an evil reputation. When I was young, there were tales of rivers running with blood, and travelers and peasants disappearing. Some said it was robbers who killed the unwary, but others said that all the robbers were long-dead, killed by the demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you believe, Liege?\" Germanno asked, watching Idelfonzuz more narrowly than he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe that many are being killed in the mountains, particularly where the forests remain. There are roads that are dangerous, and places where they have fallen away altogether, and in such places a man might come to grief. Where the trees no longer stand, there are fewer disappearances, but the land is hard, and crumbles with rain, so many do not want to live there. Even the shepherds do not graze the flocks on such shifting ground.\" He sighed abruptly. \"So the danger is in the forests. The Moors have proved this many times, and if they have truly found many skeletons, then it can only be that the killings were deliberate and not the cause of accidents or other misfortunes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have given this much thought, Liege,\" said Germanno, trying to discern what it was that the King wanted from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, and others.\" He folded his arms. \"When I was very young, I recall hunting boar and coming upon a grove in which many cups of blood were left. The priest said that this was to honor Christ\u0027s Cup, but I did not think it was. The huntsmen said it was for the demons. I believed him more.\" He looked around at the sound of footsteps. \"Ah. How pleasant to have something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cook and two servants approached carrying trays on which were set out cheese and a tub of butter and another of honey, new bread and hunks of smoked fowl and ham. A jar of wine stood open beside a silver cup. Taking care not to look directly at Idelfonzuz, they set their trays down on the table beneath the window and then backed out of the main hall, their eyes directed at their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is little enough,\" said Germanno, thinking that his household had done extremely well on such short notice, \"but if it pleases you, Liege, then we are honored by your graciousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prettily said,\" Idelfonzuz approved as he snapped his fingers for a chair; Germanno brought the best for him. \"And nicely done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man learns things in his travels,\" said Germanno, stepping back from the King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" said Idelfonzuz, taking a wedge of cheese and smearing it with honey, \"what do you think is in the mountains? You said you had crossed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was years ago,\" said Germanno, looking away from Idelfonzuz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These stories have been handed down for generations,\" came his response in a tone that insisted on an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGermanno paused, gathering his thoughts and considering his memories. \"I think the forest can conceal many things, and that no matter what they are, someone will call them demons to explain them. I think that travelers may be injured, or become ill, and so do not reach their destination, and some credit demons with their misfortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A careful remark, but not an answer,\" said Idelfonzuz around the cheese as he chewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize, Liege, but I have not knowledge enough to deal with these matters in a way that would serve you,\" Germanno replied, hoping that Idelfonzuz would be content to eat and ask nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is wise, to consider my wants.\" He swallowed the cheese and reached for another wedge of it, this time spreading it with butter before shoving it into his mouth. \"Still, you have more experience of the world than most, and therefore your knowledge is useful to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liege,\" said Germanno patiently, aware that he might be offending the King without meaning to, \"I do not seek to tell you of your own country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" said Idelfonzuz, pausing in his chewing to regard Germanno skeptically. \"Do you mean that because some of the Holy Blood region is in Aragon, you have no wish to speak disparagingly of it? You may do so without fear; I know the reputation of that part of my country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis assurance brought Germanno no relief. He cleared his throat and said, \"For centuries, Christians and Moors have fought in that region, and each has believed that God favored them. When the others triumphed, it was most satisfactory to account for this by saying demons were responsible. That has played a part in the stories over the years. And many of the people living in the mountains have been slow to give up their old faith, and although they may pray to Christ or Allah, they also leave tribute to their ancient gods, in the form of offerings.\" He had a brief, intense recollection of Pentacoste tying red twine to oak trees; then he thought of Chimena. \"Those people, the ones who keep to the old ways, are glad to honor their ancient gods, and they do not care if Christians and Moors call them demons, for that recognizes their power.\" He wondered if there was any purpose to protecting Chimena, but could not bring himself to expose her and her followers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they are faithless, and deserve to die for it,\" Idelfonzuz said as he pronged a hunk of smoked goose. \"I will instruct my soldiers to destroy their shrines. Then God will show His Might in our behalf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That could turn the folk against you,\" Germanno remarked, careful not to sound too apprehensive about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can peasants do?\" Idelfonzuz asked. \"They scatter like fish when they see a mounted soldier; it does not matter for whom he fights.\" He bit into the goose, then reached for the wine to wash it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the household servants appeared and began to light the lamps that hung throughout the main hall; they did not look at the King, but they managed to take longer than usual to accomplish this simple task. In a short while, the glimmer of lamplight vied with the setting sun in gilding the columns and arches of the hall and gallery beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why not leave them to their own devices and keep your men after the Moors?\" Germanno recommended. \"They have much more important foe than villagers and farmers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdelfonzuz shrugged. \"And besides, if they are chased off, whom shall I tax to continue the war?\" He swallowed and laughed, took a deep draught of wine, and laughed again. \"You should have been in the Church, Comide. You are subtle enough for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liege is gracious,\" said Germanno, keeping his thoughts on the matter to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have forces in Zaraguza now, and they maintain our lines, but as soon as I have readied my new soldiers, we will press the Moors from above and below. Men are being sent by the King of France-if arrangements are successful, and they will reinforce the men of Aragon and Navarra, as I will lead the men of Castile and Leon. The Moors will have to withdraw to the east and the south, and all of the north of the country will again be ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you suppose you will accomplish this, Liege?\" Germanno asked, aware that coordinating so tremendous a campaign would be an imposing task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next year. And you will aid me, for you speak the language of the King of France as you speak my tongue and that of the Moors. You will be my courier.\" He smiled fiercely, aware of the great respect he was showing Germanno. \"You will move between our lines, through the region of Holy Blood.\" His smile became a wolfish grin. \"So you must hope your assessment is right, and the forests are held by nothing more than soldiers and peasants, for you will be going through them with some regularity.\" He dug his two-tined fork into a lump of ham. \"This is all very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall inform my cook that you are pleased,\" Germanno said flatly, his mind now fully occupied with what lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You acquitted yourself well on your mission to Sevallis. This is most satisfactory, for now I know I may rely on you to act on my behalf when you are beyond my Court. This is essential for my courier. You are also not one of my subjects, so there will be less jealousy among them for the favor I show you.\" He reached out to the trays again, as if trying to make up his mind what next to eat. \"I am relieved that you will do this for me, as many of my courtiers have lands in Aragon which they will seek to defend preferentially. You have no such constraints upon your service to me, and no relatives to make demands of you in such regard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he doubted that last, Germanno said, \"Liege is most generous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a worthy man when one is proven to me,\" he said, a bit smugly as he helped himself to bread. \"You are expected to be at my service every day starting five days from now. That will allow you time to reestablish yourself in your household. Then I want you to devote your skills to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Liege,\" said Germanno automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will have many opportunities to demonstrate your value. I will be glad to advance you in accordance with your service. There is no reason you should not come out of this very much the better for being my courier.\" He bit off a wad of bread, then drank his wine to swallow it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will hope to be worthy of distinction,\" said Germanno, an ironic note in his courteous words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not a fickle King, to demand service and later renege on my obligations. I have said I will reward you: do not think I will forget. You have come through your first test in fine form.\" He drank more wine. \"This is very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you; it is from my own vineyards,\" said Germanno, then returned to what troubled him. \"Was my journey to Sevallis by way of a test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In part,\" said Idelfonzuz. \"In part you have provided me a needed base there, and for which I thank you most heartily. But generally I wanted to be certain you would do as instructed even while beyond my realm, and that you would report aright when you returned. I have read Antoninus\u0027 accounts and heard yours. I am satisfied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reason to be surprised, Germanno reminded himself. \"Then I am well-rewarded,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see?\" Idelfonzuz remarked, holding up his hand. \"That is where you are above most of my courtiers. You do not chide me, nor do you sulk that I tested your devotion to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would it matter if I did?\" Germanno asked, a bit impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No; but it is to your credit that you do not.\" He finished the wine in the jar and shook his head. \"Is there more of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\" Germanno clapped his hands, and when Ruthor appeared, said, \"Bring another jar of wine for the King.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And one for you, as well,\" Idelfonzuz exclaimed, lavish with his host\u0027s supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGermanno made a gesture of dismissal to Ruthor, then sketched a reverence in the King\u0027s direction. \"Liege is all kindness, but I do not drink wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Learned that from the Moors, did you?\" Idelfonzuz was not pleased to hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Germanno said. \"I learned it from the priest who taught me in my youth.\" It was true enough; the priest had been a god to Germanno\u0027s people and when he had brought Germanno to his undead life, he had taken all such appetites from the young initiate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdelfonzuz nodded several times. \"Yes. Some priests do abstain from all pleasures. No wives, no wine, no meat, no silks, no horses. All for the love of Christ. They might as well be hermits.\" He belched and smiled. \"Excellent food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liege does me honor to say so,\" Germanno said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, if you do not want to drink, I will have your portion,\" said Idelfonzuz with such innocent greed that Germanno lost all irritation with the man, and offered him another reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And welcome, Liege.\" He was prepared to maintain the conduct Idelfonzuz expected, but was growing tired of the necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Moors, now, they are said to be opulent hosts,\" said Idelfonzuz speculatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They may be,\" said Germanno. \"They do not so extend themselves to a stranger who is not long among them.\" As he said this, he wanted to make an attempt to lessen his apparent dissatisfaction with the Moors. \"They live with much grandeur when they can, just as Christian seigneurs do. They have men of learning around them, and they extend themselves on behalf of those less fortunate than themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admirable,\" said Idelfonzuz in a tone of utter condemnation. He licked his fingers and swung around to stare at Germanno just as Ruthor arrived carrying a large jar of wine. \"You would be well-advised to keep such praise to yourself. There are many Christians who would view such paeans as contemptible, and, as you say, you are a stranger here.\" He signaled to Ruthor to give him the wine. \"You are fortunate that I appreciate your observations, and will keep them to myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, Liege,\" Germanno told him as he offered another profound reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have much that is praiseworthy about you, Comide Ragoczy. Why endanger it with reckless comments that would give rise to general execration?\" He approached Germanno. \"When you wait upon me, guard what you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I will,\" Germanno assured him, and lowered his head as Idelfonzuz prepared to depart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Set your household in order, and then answer my call. You will have duties to attend to before autumn is here.\" He looked about him as if he had only now become aware of the vanished day. \"My escort must have torches. See to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthor spoke to Germanno, bending from the waist. \"I will attend to it at once, my master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is a good servant you have,\" Idelfonzuz approved as Ruthor hastened down the gallery. \"You must beat him often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He gives me no cause to do so,\" Germanno said without any inflection whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he not?\" the King asked in mild surprise. \"Well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGermanno knew it was his obligation to escort Idelfonzuz from his home; he did so in proper form, staying slightly behind the King and maintaining a subordinate manner. As they reached the courtyard, half a dozen mail-armored men stood waiting, holding the reins of the King\u0027s horse, a big, rawboned light chestnut with two white socks. \"My servants are bringing torches, Liege,\" Germanno reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then bring them quickly. We cannot linger here.\" Idelfonzuz signaled to one of his escort to get on his hands and knees to provide him a living mounting block; the man who obeyed this silent order smiled as he dropped on his knees and leaned forward onto his arms. While the King settled into his saddle, three servants hurried up carrying the requested torches. \"In good time,\" Idelfonzuz approved, and pulled his horse around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGermanno reverenced the King again as he left, surrounded by his armed men, who would walk him back to his castle at the highest point of the city. When the doors to the courtyard were closed, Germanno turned on his heel and went back inside his house, his head bent thoughtfully. Only when Ruthor appeared did he break his reverie. \"I am going to be sent on a mission for the King.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\" Ruthor exclaimed. \"What have we just returned from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, it seems, was a test,\" Germanno said with a faint, wry smile. \"This is what Idelfonzuz truly wants of me.\" They walked together into the main hall. \"I am to carry messages from Zaraguza to Usxa into Aragon, and bring messages back from there.\" His expression was mildly abstracted but there was a look in his dark eyes that Ruthor found disquieting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would have to pass through Chimena\u0027s territory, would you not?\" he asked knowing it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would,\" said Germanno. \"Idelfonzuz claims I am the only man he can trust with such an enterprise.\" He paused and looked directly at Ruthor. \"Which I take to mean that he considers me expendable. If I fail to get through the region of Holy Blood, there will be no one to demand blood money from him, or any Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you expect otherwise?\" Ruthor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Yet I was a bit...taken aback at how obvious he was.\" He fixed his gaze on the middle distance. \"I will have to think on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthor nodded, then looked closely at Germanno. \"What of Lailie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGermanno sighed. \"Yes. I have brought her here. I owe her more than leaving without explanation.\" He glanced at Ruthor, saying in the Persian tongue. \"Yes, I know. You are troubled that I have only visited her in sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has occurred to me,\" said Ruthor in the same language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe that I should make her my lover.\" He shrugged. \"She does not seek me, she wants a husband, or, barring that, someone who will keep her properly, care for her, and show her respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do these things,\" Ruthor observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not while I am running errands for Idelfonzuz. And it may be that we will have to depart hurriedly.\" Germanno took a deep breath. \"No. That would not do, not for Lailie. She has had her father leave her already; she does not need a lover to do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will visit her in sleep again?\" Ruthor said, doing his best not to make this a suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" said Germanno. \"Once certainly, perhaps twice.\" He rubbed his chin with his thumb, right along the line of his close-cropped beard. \"I would rather she knows me, but that would be unwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would accept you,\" said Ruthor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In time, she might,\" said Germanno. \"But always with reservations, and eventually with disgust, though that would trouble her. She is true to her religion, and that does not give room for friendship with vampires.\" He paused, and added, \"I have not said that word aloud for a long time, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A prudent thing, as you have often told me,\" Ruthor reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but sad, nonetheless.\" He started away from Ruthor, then hurried back. \"You have many tasks to attend to, have you not?\" This time he spoke in the language of Castile and Leon. \"You are apt to be occupied with them for a day or two, are you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As we have just returned, yes, I have, and I will be.\" Ruthor was puzzled; it was unusual for Germanno to ask about something so obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will not bother you with going to the Jewish quarter and speaking with the elders there on Lailie\u0027s behalf.\" He laid his hand on Ruthor\u0027s shoulder, a familiarity that was unique in Toledom households. \"You may have to supervise visits here while I am gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone? I am not to go with you?\" For the first time since Idelfonzuz had arrived, Ruthor was alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt the King will allow it,\" said Germanno. \"Besides, if it comes to that, I would prefer only one of us be killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthor found it difficult not to argue. \"If that is your wish,\" he said stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your sake, old friend, I wish it.\" He dropped his hand and began to walk away. Halfway down the gallery, he paused and looked back. \"There is no reason to be angry. It is no punishment to be kept from the fray. And you are for more useful to me here: I rely on you to keep all in order until I am able to return. We have some little time, after all; I do not have to leave instanter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave at the pleasure of the King,\" said Ruthor in a steady voice, knowing it was useless to press the Comide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Germanno said with a quick smile. \"What other reason is there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a letter from Ximon ben Mazo to Germanno, Comide Ragoczy, written in the Toledom vulgate and delivered by messenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the most respected foreigner who enjoys the favor of Idelfonzuz himself, to Germanno, Comide Ragoczy, the greetings and deep esteem of Ximon ben Mazo, clerk-advocate of Toledom and Reader of Texts at our synagogue; it is in the latter capacity that I am moved to address you, in answer to your visit of the immediately previous week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not generally admit women to our numbers. There are many good reasons for this exclusion, all to be found in the Texts of our faith that advise men and women to be as God made them, and not to try to venture to the proper realms of the sex to which one does not belong. I would be glad to cite those references which are the authority in these matters, if you are not familiar with them for your own perusal of sacred writings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, as you have said, an educated woman is a rare thing, and as such, requires nurturing and protection beyond that which is usually extended to women. It would be most helpful to our scholars to have one among us with such broad knowledge of tongues as you say this woman possesses. We ask you to bring her here that we may test your claims of her knowledge, so that we may decide if it is appropriate to forgo our usual exclusions and permit her to assist us, and on what terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou say she has only a rudimentary command of Latin. This is unfortunate, for now that Toledom is once again in Christian hands, such capability is especially valuable. Still, it is possible that she might, in time, learn enough of that language to increase her worth in our eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must tell you that I, myself, am not sanguine about having a woman-scholar in our numbers. Women are a distraction, and can lead to jealousies and intrigues that would serve to disrupt the standard of study we have sought to maintain here, no matter who occupied the palace. What Moors and Christians could not accomplish, I fear a single woman might, for the men who study here are not eunuchs, and they are not unmoved by female wiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much easier this would be if she were old, or disfigured, or deaf, or in any other way unattractive, for then it would be any easy task to discourage all improper thoughts. But you tell me she is young and handsome. This could be intolerable, no matter how great her scholarship. Many of our scholars have wives who would be moved to anger if their husbands should be in the company of a woman-let alone a young and personable one-during their hours here. Do not argue that wives would not protest her presence, for they have occasionally spoken against the beautiful Moorish youths who would come here from time to time in the past. If a young man can stir such opposition, think what a young woman would do. The discord that might result from this appalls me as I write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou inform me that this young woman has lived in Sevallis and therefore has knowledge of the society of that place, and that such knowledge may well prove useful to us in time, when the Christians reclaim the south. While I agree that it is likely such a thing will happen, I am not as convinced as you are that it will happen in a decade. I base my opinion on the knowledge that Idelfonzuz has been concentrating on the east, not the south, and until he has the boundaries of Castile against the boundaries of Aragon with no Moorish holdings between them in any part, he will not be content to claim any other lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt this is a more sensible strategy; to capture Sevallis and yet see his own kingdom fall to the Moors would be a blow that would be inclined to cripple him as leader of the Christian forces, and would provide the Comide of Barzelunya an excuse to ally more with the forces of Toulouza, a most undesirable possibility. In sum, the young woman\u0027s affiliation with Sevallis is of minor importance at best, and will not mitigate our decision in her regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I will not immediately tell you that her cause is wholly lost. We have high regard for learning here, even in so unlikely a representative as a young woman. However, I would advise you to speak to a matchmaker for her, so that she will be known to be ready to marry. That may well diminish the hard feelings that she would otherwise encounter. Let her find a man, one of our number, to make her his wife, and then, if he is willing, she may accompany him to study with us. That would not be entirely welcome to many, but it would also not be as unacceptable as the presence of an unmarried and unbespoken woman. If she has a dowry of reasonable size-and you tell me that she has-it should not be too difficult to find her one among these young scholars who will be glad of her comfort and aid. If you seek a husband for her among the Christians, I must tell you that the chance of her acceptance here would be slighter than it is now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubt whether it is entirely wise to leave the choice of a husband wholly in her hands. Such a decision cannot be made by a woman. She must be guided by those more prudent than she, more knowing of the character of the men who might offer for her. I also do not think you have been entirely wise to allow her to bestow her dowry as she sees fit. Still, that is your position, and we have your intentions in hand, so if she comes to grief over your ill-considered liberality, it will be on your head, not ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me and my colleagues examine her, to find out if her scholarship is as fine as you say it is. Then we shall render our decision. If you will permit me to tell the others that she will soon be married, I think you may hope for a better response than if she is seen as wholly independent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI await your response with respect and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod give you praise and plenty, Comide Ragoczy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXimon ben Mazo \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/come-twilight-saint-germain-13/page-31.html","bookId":2499,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:56:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:56:48 PM"}
