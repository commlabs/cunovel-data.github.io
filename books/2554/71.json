Even when her vocalizations ratcheted down to quaking sobs, the grief that poured from her remained considerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll for a dumb animal that was, in many other countries, considered an entree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m terribly sorry for your loss,\" he said when she finally quieted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My goodness,\" he said. \"I hope it wasn\u0027t my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head snapped up. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, just before he died I gave him a piece of my turkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sniffed. \"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I hope it didn\u0027t cause a reaction or anything. He wasn\u0027t allergic to turkey, was he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he ate it all the time.\" She was staring at him, although he knew he was just a blur to her. \"That turkey was to help you regain your strength, yet you gave him some?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he seemed like such a sweet, loyal dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began sobbing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood ... good. Keep it up. More. Give me more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so happy that-that-that his last memory was of a stranger being kind to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis last memory? The cow was pathetic. That creature had been little more than a quadrupedal appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke down again, bending over the dog, placing her cheek against its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Rasalom drank, he lifted the blanket and examined his burns. Healing nicely now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and sighed as he feasted. Too bad he couldn\u0027t bring the dog back to life - just for a few minutes, just long enough to let her believe her pet was back from the dead - and then stop its heart again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his previous life he\u0027d been so much more powerful. His very proximity could cause people to turn on each other, commit atrocities they would never dream of had he not entered their lives. He\u0027d been able to make the dead move, walk, appear almost alive, even though they were not. But Glaeken had ended that life and Rasalom had been forced to wait until his rebirth to begin rebuilding his powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not yet powerful enough to make this carcass move. He could end a life, make a life a living hell, but he couldn\u0027t restore a life. Never could. Dead was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least until the Change.
