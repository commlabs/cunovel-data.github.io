I want them worried as hell. I want my team running scared before any trial. And especially this one. We are bringing this suit against the EPA, and in anticipation of that, the agency has retained outside counsel in the person of Barry Beckman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whew,\" Evans said. \"Big guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry Beckman was the most famous litigator of his generation. A professor at Stanford Law School at twenty-eight, he left the university in his early thirties to go into private practice. He had already represented Microsoft, Toyota, Phillips, and a host of other multinationals. Beckman had an incredibly agile mind, a charming manner, a quick sense of humor, and a photographic memory. Everyone knew that when he argued before the Supreme Court (as he had done three times already) he cited document page numbers as he answered the Justices\u0027 questions. \"Your honor, I believe you will find that in footnote 17 on the bottom of page 237.\" Like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barry has his faults,\" Balder said. \"He has so much information at his fingertips that he can easily slip into irrelevance. He likes to hear himself talk. His arguments drift. I have beaten him once. And lost to him, once. But one thing is sure: We can expect an extremely well-prepared opposition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it a little unusual to hire an attorney before you\u0027ve even filed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a tactic,\" Balder said. \"The current administration doesn\u0027t want to defend this lawsuit. They believe they will win, but they don\u0027t want the negative publicity that will accompany their brief against global warming. So they hope to intimidate us into dropping the case. And of course we never would. Especially now that we are fully funded, thanks to Mr. Morton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the same time, the challenges are significant. Barry will argue that there is insufficient evidence for global warming. He will argue that the supporting science is weak. He will argue that the predictions from ten and fifteen years ago have already been shown to be wrong. And he will argue that even leading proponents of global warming have publicly expressed doubts about whether it can be predicted, whether it is a serious problemand indeed, whether it\u0027s occurring at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leading proponents have said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalder sighed. \"They have. In journals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never read anything of that sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The statements exist. Barry will dig them out.\" He shook his head. \"Some experts have expressed different views at different times. Some have said rising carbon dioxide isn\u0027t a big problem; now they say it is. So far, we don\u0027t have a single expert witness that can\u0027t be turned. Or made to look very foolish on cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans nodded sympathetically. He was familiar with this circumstance. One of the first things you learned in law school was that the law was not about truth. It was about dispute resolution. In the course of resolving a dispute, the truth might or might not emerge. Often it did not. Prosecutors might know a criminal was guilty, and still be unable to convict him. It happened all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why,\" Balder said, \"this case is going to hinge on the sea-level records in the Pacific. We are collecting all available data records now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does the case hinge on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I believe,\" Balder said, \"that this is a case we should bait and switch. The case is about global warming, but that\u0027s not where the emotional impact is for a jury. Juries aren\u0027t comfortable reading graphs. And all this talk about tenths of a degree Celsius goes right over their heads. It\u0027s technical detail; it\u0027s the quibbles of experts; and it\u0027s incredibly boring for normal people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the jury will see this as a case about helpless, victimized, impoverished people being flooded out of their ancestral homelands. A case about the terror of sea levels rising precipitouslyand inexplicably with no conceivable cause unless you accept that something extraordinary and unprecedented has affected the entire world in recent years. Something that is causing the sea levels to rise and to threaten the lives of innocent men, women, and children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that something is global warming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalder nodded. \"The jury will have to draw their own conclusions. If we can show them a convincing record of rising sea levels, we will be on very strong ground. When juries see that damage has been done, they are inclined to blame somebody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Evans saw where Balder was going. \"So the sea-level data is important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but it needs to be solid, irrefutable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so hard to obtain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalder cocked an eyebrow. \"Mr. Evans, do you know anything about the study of sea levels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I just know that sea levels are rising around the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, that claim is in considerable dispute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re joking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is well known,\" Balder said, \"that I have no sense of humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But sea level can\u0027t be disputed,\" Evans said. \"It\u0027s too simple. You put a mark on a dock at high tide, measure it year after year, watch it go up amp;I mean, how difficult can it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalder sighed. \"You think sea level is simple? Trust me, it\u0027s not. Have you ever heard of the geoid? No? The geoid is the equipotential surface of the earth\u0027s gravitational field that approximates the mean sea surface. That help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is a core concept in the measurement of sea levels.\" Balder flipped through the stack of papers in front of him. \"How about glacio-hydro-isostatic modeling? Eustatic and tectonic effects on shoreline dynamics? Holocene sedimentary sequences? Intertidal foraminifera distributions? Carbon analysis of coastal paleoenvironments? Aminostratigraphy? No? Not ringing a bell? Let me assure you, sea level is a fiercely debated specialty.\" He tossed the last of the papers aside. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m working through now. But the disputes within the field give added importance to finding an unimpeachable set of data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are obtaining this data?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting for them to arrive, yes. The Australians have several sets. The French have at least one in Moorea and perhaps another in Papeete. There is a set that was funded by the V. Allen Willy Foundation, but it may be of too short a duration. And other sets as well. We will have to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intercom buzzed. The assistant said, \"Mr. Balder, it\u0027s Mr. Drake on the line, from NERF.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Balder turned to Evans, extended a hand. \"Nice talking with you, Mr. Evans. Again, our thanks to George. Tell him any time he wants to have a look around, he can drop by. We are always hard at work here. Good luck to you. Close the door on your way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalder turned away, picking up the phone. Evans heard him say, \"Well, Nick, what the fuck is going on at NERF? Are you going to fix this for me, or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked out of Balder\u0027s office with a sense of nagging unease. Balder was one of the most persuasive men on the planet. He had known Evans was there on behalf of George Morton. He knew Morton was on the verge of making a huge contribution to the lawsuit. Balder should have been totally upbeat, radiating confidence. And he had, indeed, begun that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no doubt we will win this lawsuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, Evans had heard:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenges are significant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not have a single expert witness who can\u0027t be turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a case we should bait and switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis case will hinge on sea-level records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSea level is a fiercely debated specialty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will have to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt certainly wasn\u0027t a conversation calculated to raise Evans\u0027s level of confidence. Neither, for that matter, was the video session he\u0027d had with Jennifer Haynes, discussing the scientific problems the lawsuit would face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, as he considered it, he decided that these expressions of doubt were actually a sign of confidence on the part of the legal team. Evans was an attorney himself; he had come to learn the issues surrounding the trial, and they had been forthright with him. It was a case they would win, even though it would not be easy, because of the complexity of the data and the short attention span of the jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo: would he recommend that Morton continue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was waiting for him outside Balder\u0027s office. She said, \"They\u0027re ready for you back in the conference room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said, \"I\u0027m really sorry, I can\u0027t. My schedule amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" she said, \"we\u0027ll do it another time. I was wondering if your schedule was really tight, or whether there was time for you and me to have lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Evans said, without missing a beat, \"my schedule isn\u0027t that tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCULVER CITY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, AUGUST 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:15 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had lunch in a Mexican restaurant in Culver City. It was quiet. There were a handful of film editors in the corner, from nearby Sony Studios. A couple of high school kids necking. A group of older women in sunhats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in a corner booth and both ordered the special. Evans said, \"Balder seems to think the sea-level data is key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Balder thinks. Frankly, I\u0027m not so sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s seen all the data. But even if it\u0027s high quality, it needs to show a substantial sea-level rise to impress a jury. It may not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could it not?\" Evans said. \"With glaciers melting, and breaking off Antarctica\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so, it may not,\" she said. \"You know the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean? They were concerned about flooding, so a team of Scandinavian researchers came in to study sea levels. The scientists found no rise in several centuriesand a fall in the last twenty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fall? Was that published?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last year,\" she said. The food came; Jennifer gave a dismissive wave of her hand: enough shop talk for now. She ate her burrito with gusto, wiping her chin with the back of her hand. He saw a jagged white scar running from her palm down the underside of her forearm. She said, \"God, I love this food. You can\u0027t get decent Mexican food in DC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that where you\u0027re from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I came out to help John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t turn him down.\" She shrugged. \"So I see my boyfriend on alternate weekends. He comes out here, or I go back there. But if this trial goes forward, it will be a year, maybe two years. I don\u0027t think our relationship will make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he do? Your boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans smiled. \"Sometimes I think everyone\u0027s an attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone is. He does securities law. Not my thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witness prep and jury selection. Psychological analysis of the pool. That\u0027s why I\u0027m in charge of the focus groups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that most people we might put on the jury will have heard of global warming, and most will probably be inclined to think it is real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, I\u0027d hope so,\" Evans said. \"I mean, it\u0027s been an established fact for the last fifteen years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we need to determine what people will believe in the face of contrary evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as the graphs I showed you today. Or the satellite data. You know about the satellite data?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The theory of global warming predicts that the upper atmosphere will warm from trapped heat, just like a greenhouse. The surface of the Earth warms later. But since 1979 we\u0027ve had orbiting satellites that can continuously measure the atmosphere five miles up. They show that the upper atmosphere is warming much less than the ground is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe there\u0027s a problem with the data\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, the satellite data have been re-analyzed dozens of times,\" she said. \"They\u0027re probably the most intensely scrutinized data in the world. But the data from weather balloons agree with the satellites. They show much less warming than expected by the theory.\" She shrugged. \"Another problem for us. We\u0027re working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think it\u0027ll prove too complex for a jury. The details of MSUsmicrowave-sounding units, cross-track scanners with four-channel radiance analysisand the questions about whether channel 2 has been corrected for diurnal drifts and inter-satellite offsets, time-varying nonlinear instrumental responses amp;We hope it will make them throw up their hands. Anyway. Enough of all that.\" She wiped her face with her napkin and again he saw the white scar that ran down the underside of her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you get that?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"In law school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I thought my school was tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I taught an inner-city karate class,\" she said. \"Sometimes it went late. You want any more of these chips?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we get the check?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not a lot to tell. One night, I got in my car to drive home, and a kid jumped in the passenger seat and pulled a gun.

Late twenties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him to get out. He told me to drive. So I started the car, and as I put it in gear I asked him where he wanted me to go. And he was stupid enough to point, so I hit him in the windpipe. I didn\u0027t hit him hard enough, and he got off a round, blew out the windshield. Then I hit him again with my elbow. Couple, three times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to him?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some people make bad decisions,\" she said. \"What\u0027re you staring at me like that for?
