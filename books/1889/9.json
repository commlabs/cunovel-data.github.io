Jane was right, she doesn’t need me as much as I need her. Stuart was right, she is stronger than we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know her as well as I think I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what to do with myself so I walk for a long time in a daze, until my phone rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" It\u0027s Stuart with his cheesy, fake Wichita accent that he swears helps keep him in character with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she alright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"She\u0027s fine. She went to some fancy place and ate and went back to her room. She\u0027s fine. She and Michelle are good in there. But dude, for reals, my balls are burning. They are so blue, I can barely walk. I\u0027m picking Michelle up in like thirty minutes. I\u0027ll have her back in no time, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel spacey and lost. I nod and mutter, \"Sure.\" I have to map myself back to the car. I call her and get my angry act on; it\u0027s not hard. I am angry, but it\u0027s with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she answers sounding strong and amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snap, \"You don’t go to restaurants with boys that you haven’t cleared with me first.\" I\u0027m angry for petty reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t. You knew what I was doing.\" She sounds angry, I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play games with me. You won\u0027t win. You specifically told me you were going to a chicken place and never went there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stammers, \"I\u0027m sorry. I should have called and told you we were changing places. I just…well…I had an attack and had to leave the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounds weak again and it softens me, \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses and sighs, \"No. I had it right in front of him. It was humiliating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call the doc. She\u0027ll want to see you.\" I hate that she has to see Jane, but I want this over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that, \"Don\u0027t say that. It\u0027s rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat, \"If you\u0027re going to date, and Stuart is dating the ever-lovely Miss Monkton, then the rules are changing. You will not date on the same evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can almost hear her frown, \"What if we have a date planned for the same night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see my car and sigh, \"Then he cancels his. You will remain in the dorms if he and Miss Monkton are out. Are we clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup,\" she sounds pissed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup, is piss-poor English. Goodnight, sweet dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never said that to her before. I hang up like always and just stare at the phone. I am losing my strength and control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive to the campus and follow someone into her dorms. I slide down the wall and sit in the hallway outside her room with my iPad and wait, listening to the sound of her TV. I\u0027m exhausted, but I know how scared she is. If she knew I was sitting outside her room, she would feel better but she can\u0027t. So I just have to sit there and hope she can be strong until Michelle comes home. I know what happens to her at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI message her, \u0027Go to sleep.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe texts back, \u0027You first.\u0027 It makes me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin as I text her like we\u0027re normal people, \u0027I am sleeping.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you dreaming about?\u0027 My stomach aches when I see her response. She is being friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers don’t stand a chance. They know they shouldn’t text her the one word they want to, but they do it anyway. \u0027You.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer room is nearly silent. She doesn’t move in there or answer back for a few minutes. \u0027What am I doing? In your dream?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, it\u0027s the right amount of time I need to get my head back on straight. I can\u0027t ever be the person she needs. I clench my jaw and text back, \u0027Sleeping and not annoying the living hell out of me.\u0027 I stare at the phone, hating myself as I type, \u0027Night.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stay as long as I have to, which is all night. My eyes flutter a few times, but I can stay awake for long amounts of time. I used to have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle comes home in the wee hours of the morning, about ten minutes after Stuart messages me to tell me he is there to drop her off. I stroll out to where they\u0027re kissing goodnight and wait for her to get out of the truck. From behind the tree, she can\u0027t see me, but I can see the satisfaction on her face. Stuart also looks happy. I can\u0027t interfere in that, as much as I want to. I can\u0027t. I love seeing him happy. He\u0027s the only brother I ever had and he never lets girls get to him. He bangs and moves on, as he so eloquently puts it. He is my family, the only one I have ever really had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I think I replaced Em with him. I walk to the truck as Michelle walks to the dorm door. I get in and give him a look, \"No more dates on the same night, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Alright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a good time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods but his face doesn’t have any of the bliss it did before, \"You look wiped. You been here the whole time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yawn and nod, \"Yeah. I need some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles, \"You are taking this to a dark fucking place, man. I got the next watch.\" He takes us home to my place. I crash instantly and sleep like the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wake, Stuart\u0027s passed out on the sofa. I frown, \"Stu, where is she?\" The hallway camera is annoying. I can\u0027t see anything but her door. I text her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t respond, it goes to voicemail. The message doesn’t deliver. I swallow hard. \"Stu, where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens an eye, \"What?\" He pops up, \"Oh shit, man, I fell asleep. Sorry, dude. She\u0027s probably there still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench my jaw, \"WHERE IS SHE?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts a hand out, \"Breaths. I\u0027ll find Michelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe texts and shakes his head, \"Michelle left her in the room sleeping. She\u0027s probably still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FUCK!\" I start sending text messages. Not great ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why is your phone not receiving the messages?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I am going to send you back to that fucking orphanage if you don’t answer my god damned messages!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027WHERE ARE YOU?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAID I DIDN\u0027T LIKE THE DATE! IF YOU\u0027RE HURT SOMEWHERE AND I CAN\u0027T FIND YOU, YOU\u0027RE IN TROUBLE!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart waves his hands, shouting at me, \"SHE\u0027S IN THE SHOWER. MELLOW YOUR SHIT. MICHELLE IS GETTING HER NOW.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl, \"IS SHE WITH HER NOW?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"YES! Now chill out. Stop yelling at me. In two years we haven’t slipped up once. Dang dude, it\u0027s too early for this shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see my messages start to deliver just as she phones. I feel like I\u0027m going to explode, \"YOU EVER TURN THAT DAMN PHONE OFF AGAIN AND I WILL COME AND GET YOU. NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the silence and the panic, and then the tears. She can\u0027t breathe and I feel like shit. She doesn’t know why I worry. She doesn’t know that I lost her once and it cost me everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her world, she is fine. This is fine. She hasn’t ever been missing before in her world. I take a breath and speak softly, \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry. I was wrong to shout like that. You scared me. I have to know where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t talk. She whimpers slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper almost, \"I can hear you breathing. I know you’re upset. Close your eyes. Just like Doctor Bradley says. Close them and find the peace and gratitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an asshole,\" she whispers. A laugh bursts from me. It\u0027s huge progress for us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t turn it off again, okay?\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Come on. Work with me here. It\u0027s all for your benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she\u0027s angry. I have yet to see that. Emotions beyond fear, from her are amazing feats. \"You mad?\" I ask, trying not to sound too amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" I hang up and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remember the texts and quickly send her a message, \u0027Ignore the bad messages, the early in the morning ones. Got a bit desperate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Stuart and wince, \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he does. He\u0027s the only one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks exhausted. I nod, \"Go back to bed. I\u0027ll take the next watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"No. We gotta go work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Alright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to say no, but I know she has classes all day and Michelle will be with her. I need to get work done and work out. Stuart and I learned early on, people like us have a need to work out. It\u0027s a dark need that can\u0027t be filled by anything other than full-on exertion. We did CrossFit for a while but boxing is the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never noticed on the drive over to the gym he was quiet, but I detect it in the ring. He\u0027s pussyfooting around and barely taking shots. I pull back, watching his face for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrow cocks instantly, \"Really? I\u0027ve known you for fifteen years—that’s the best lie you\u0027ve got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts, \"She\u0027s going to a club tonight, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn for the ropes-car-dorms-hostage situation but he grabs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she needs this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing at him but he jumps back, laughing, \"This is the journey. Me and you have both been down this road, bro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashes of me and Stuart in bars screwing chicks in bathrooms fills my mind. My eyes widen. I shove him and jump the ropes. He tackles me into the wall. I shove him off but he jerseys me and drags me down the hallway bent over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tosses me into the change room, making me stumble over a bench. His face is red when he points his glove, \"Stop this shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I can\u0027t let her go to a bar. She can\u0027t. She\u0027ll freak and panic, and have an attack in front of everyone, and that will set her back further. She cares so much about how she seems to them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"I know.\" His dark eyes cloud over, \"Who knows about the lonely better than me?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-9.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
