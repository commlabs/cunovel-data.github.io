She led Zach to the middle of the room and started to sway. Zach gyrated, too, shutting his eyes and feeling the music with his body. Unlike most guys, who shuffled back and forth like Frankenstein’s monster, Zach danced like a pro. He didn’t freak when other guys bumped him, either, but just shrugged and went with it. He opened his clear, blue eyes, met Spencer’s longing stare, and winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer threw her head back and laughed. He was the sexiest guy she’d ever met. The voltage between them was cranked up as high as it could go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned into his ear. “This is awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Zach answered. “You’re a great dancer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So are you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beat slowed down, and Zach and Spencer moved closer and closer to one another until their hips touched. Spencer’s heart clanged in her chest like the clapper in a bell. When she opened her eyes, all she could see were Zach’s beautiful lips. He opened his eyes and gazed at her, too. She moved an inch closer. Zach edged in, too. Here goes . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, Spencer grabbed the back of his neck and planted her lips on Zach’s. He smelled like a spicy face cream and tasted like sugar and lime. His lips were stiff for a moment, but then they opened and let her in. Spencer’s stomach did somersaults. Electricity snapped off her skin. She raked her hands through Zach’s soft hair, wishing they could fall into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Zach pulled away. The strobe light danced across his face. He looked confused. Upset. Spencer took a few steps back, too, heat immediately rising to her cheeks. It felt like everyone was looking at her, laughing at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach grabbed Spencer’s arm and pulled her into a sitting area just off the dance floor. He settled down on the plushy velvet couch under billowing canopies. It was the sort of place couples tumbled into to make out, but suddenly the moment felt charged in all the wrong ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’ve misunderstood,” Zach said. “Maybe I’ve misled you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine,” Spencer snapped, staring pointedly at the glowing disco ball in the center of the dance floor. “So what is it? Do you have a girlfriend or something? Are you freaked out that our parents are dating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not any of that.” Zach shut his eyes. “Actually, Spencer . . . I think I’m gay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s jaw dropped. She stared at Zach’s thick eyebrows and strong shoulders, not believing it. He didn’t look gay. He liked baseball. And beer. And he’d seemed to like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t mean to give you the wrong idea.” Zach grabbed Spencer’s hands and squeezed them hard. “I’ve been having so much fun with you, and I don’t want anything between us to end. It’s just . . . no one knows. Especially not my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song morphed into a sped-up mix from something by the Glee cast, and a bunch of girls screamed. Spencer stared at Zach’s soft, slender hands in hers. Something inside her turned over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your secret is safe with me,” she said, squeezing his hands hard. The proud, always-gets-what-she-wants girl inside of her still felt disappointed and embarrassed, but she also felt flattered and touched that Zach found her as fun as she found him. If their parents continued dating, maybe Zach would end up being the perfect quasi-sibling Spencer had always wanted. Maybe she should’ve been searching for a brother instead of a sister all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach jumped to his feet and pulled Spencer up, too. “Glad we got that straightened out. Now where were we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer tossed her blond hair over her shoulder. She felt light and free as she sashayed through the crowd, but a presence behind her made her stop and turn. There, under the glowing EXIT sign, stood a dark, hooded figure staring straight at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer stepped back, her heart leaping to her throat. A split second later, the figure had turned away and melted into the crowd—anonymous, undetectable, but still dangerously close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriends tell friends everything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rolands’ SUV was already gone when Emily pulled into the driveway that same Thursday night. When she went to ring the doorbell, she noticed the front door wasn’t completely closed. “Hello?” Emily pushed it open and stepped into the foyer. A cartoon was on in the living room. Grace was in her baby swing in the corner, her head lolled to the side and her eyes closed. The Roland parents had sprung a last-minute outing on Chloe, and Emily had offered to help her babysit Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily?” Chloe called from the kitchen. “Is that you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Chloe!” Emily walked toward her. “I’m so sorry I’m late!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s cool! I’m making nachos!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily passed through the living room into the big, bright kitchen. Boxes of Cheerios, drying bottles, stacks of unopened Pampers, and a container of baby wipes littered the table. A bag of Tostitos and a jar of cheese dip sat on the island along with an open bottle of champagne. Chloe noticed Emily looking at it. “Want a glass?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily glanced at the snoozing baby in the living room. “But what about Grace?” All she could think of were those TV shows featuring police officers hauling drunk babysitters off to jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One glass won’t hurt.” Chloe’s limbs moved loosely as if she’d already had a glass or two before Emily arrived. She poured champagne into two crystal flutes. “And anyway, we need to toast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To being friends.” Chloe chanced a smile. “It’s awesome to come to a new school and immediately bond with someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily smiled. She’d always been a sucker for cheesy friendship rituals—Best Friends necklaces, secret languages, complicated inside jokes—and it had been so, so long since anyone wanted to share one with her. “One glass,” she relented, grabbing the flute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls toasted and sipped. The microwave dinged, and Chloe retrieved the plate of nachos, and they carried the plates, glasses, and bottle of champagne to the living room so they could keep an eye on Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So where are your parents?” Emily asked after she’d settled on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At a romantic dinner.” Chloe crunched on a chip. “My mom says they need to rekindle their relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily frowned. “I thought you said things were great between them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were . . . but things have been different since we moved here.” A faraway look washed over Chloe’s face. “I swear it’s because of this house. It has bad mojo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared blankly at the cover of the large book called Rome in Pictures on the coffee table, her heart pumping hard between her ears. “When you mentioned one of your parents cheating, was it your mom or your dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe wiped a blob of cheese from her chin. “My dad. But I never found out if it was true or not.” Then she gave Emily a funny look. “Why do you care so much about my parents, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t!” Warmth rose to Emily’s face. “Or, I mean, I do, but . . .” She trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should be talking about our relationships, not theirs.” Chloe slurred her words a little. “I’ll tell you a secret of mine if you tell me one of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already told mine,” Emily said. “Dating the girl? Remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but you didn’t give me details.” Chloe crossed her arms over her chest, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily traced a large gash in the wooden table with her index finger. “How about you go first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Chloe tapped her lips, thinking. “I dated someone I wasn’t supposed to. My soccer instructor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Emily nearly dropped the gooey chip she was holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup. His name was Maurizio. He was from Brazil. Everyone had a crush on him, but one night we found ourselves alone in the practice room, and . . .” Chloe shut her eyes. “It was pretty hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.” Emily breathed. “Are you still together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way.” Chloe’s chandelier-style earrings smacked against her face as she shook her head. “I found out he had a girlfriend in Rio. Apparently she wanted to kick my ass. Honestly, that was the main reason I quit soccer. I couldn’t handle being around him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily crunched silently for a moment. Grace, still in her baby swing next to the couch, opened her eyes and sucked gently on her pacifier, unimpressed by the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So.” Chloe crossed her legs. “Have you ever had a boyfriend besides that swimming loser? Or did he turn you off guys for good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe champagne burned in Emily’s stomach. “Um, I had a boyfriend after him—Isaac. But it didn’t work out.” A pang of sadness overcame her, and she lowered her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe shifted her weight. “Do you wish it had?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace began to fuss, and Emily stroked her soft, downy head. That was a loaded question. “Yes and no, I guess.” The next words out of her mouth surprised her. “He wasn’t the love of my life, though. Ali was. Well, the girl I knew as Ali in seventh grade was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe’s mouth dropped open. “You and Ali were . . . together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily took a deep breath. “Not exactly. I had a huge crush on her. I was devastated when she disappeared. I had this fantasy she was totally fine, and I dreamed about her coming back all the time. And then . . . she did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole story spilled out of her, right up until Real Ali kissed her. “But it was all an act,” Emily whispered, her eyes filling with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God.” There were tears in Chloe’s eyes, too. “I’m so, so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, Chloe’s sympathy opened a floodgate inside Emily. And the more Emily’s shoulders shook, the more she wasn’t entirely sure she was crying just because of Ali. Maybe it was because of Jamaica, too. When Tabitha and Emily danced, everything had suddenly felt right, just like the moment when Real Ali kissed her. But then, something on Tabitha’s wrist caught Emily’s eye. It was a bracelet made of faded blue string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stopped dead on the dance floor and stared at it. It looked exactly like the bracelet Ali had made for Emily, Spencer, and the others the summer after they’d accidentally blinded Jenna Cavanaugh. Ali had ceremoniously passed around the bracelets, making the girls promise to wear them—and keep the Jenna Thing a secret—until the day they died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarms blared in her head. She took a big step away from Tabitha. There was no way she could’ve gotten her hands on that bracelet. Unless . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTabitha stopped, too. “What’s wrong?” She looked down and realized what Emily was staring at. A bemused smile drifted over her face, as if she knew precisely what made Emily so afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Grace began to cry. Emily gently lifted her out of her swing and cradled her in her arms. “It’s okay,” she said softly, her voice croaky with tears. Grace’s cries turned to muffled whimpers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-pretty-little-liars-9/page-20.html","bookId":2677,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:59 AM"}
