Duncan wanted to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vassal put his hand on Duncan\u0027s shoulder. It was probably meant as a sympathetic gesture. Duncan wasn\u0027t sure if Anthony was offering him condolences because he was wed to Madelyne or if the vassal was giving him understanding over the scene he\u0027d just witnessed. Duncan didn\u0027t appreciate the action, no matter what the motive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something I\u0027ve been meaning to tell you, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony\u0027s voice was mild but it captured Duncan\u0027s attention. He turned to scowl at his first-in-command. \"What is it?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife is determined to ride Silenus,\" Anthony said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I\u0027m dead and unable to witness it,\" Duncan roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony had the gall to smile. He turned, a blatant attempt to shield his face from Duncan. \"Protecting your wife is an unusually demanding challenge. When her mind is set on a plan of action, there\u0027s no stopping her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has ruined my faithful horse,\" Duncan shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Anthony answered, unable to keep his amusement out of his voice. \"She has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shook his head. \"God, I thought I\u0027d lost her.\" His voice had turned into a harsh whisper. When he looked down at his hands, saw how they still shook, he was immediately furious again. \"I\u0027m going to kill her. You may witness the deed if you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was back to shouting. Anthony wasn\u0027t intimidated. The vassal leaned back against the wall. He asked only curiously, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would improve your day,\" Duncan announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony did laugh then. \"I didn\u0027t mean to ask you why I\u0027d want to witness Madelyne\u0027s death, Baron. I meant to ask you why you\u0027d want to kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony\u0027s laughter didn\u0027t sit well with his lord. \"How would you like the new duty of seeing to the water?\" he threatened. \"Would you find it amusing to drag bucket after bucket to the kitchens? Would that duty be challenge enough, Anthony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an insulting suggestion for someone of Anthony\u0027s rank. Duncan thought his vassal would immediately show contrition over his lack of respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony, however, didn\u0027t seem to be the least contrite. \" \u0027Tis a dangerous mission you give me, Baron. You\u0027ve only to ask Ansel just how dangerous this duty is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your squire nearly drowned the other day. He had climbed to the top of the steps to the rainwater vat, when a ball hit him square in the shoulders. He lost his balance, of course, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan held up his hand for silence. He didn\u0027t want to hear any more of this tale. He closed his eyes, praying for patience. Though he didn\u0027t know the full story, he had an instinctive feeling his gentle little wife was behind Ansel\u0027s mishap. He\u0027d also noticed her showing a new game to the children yesterday afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond walked over to join Duncan and Anthony. \"What is so amusing to you, Anthony?\" Edmond asked. Duncan\u0027s brother was still too shaken by Madelyne\u0027s brush with death to find anything remotely humorous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our lord is going to kill his wife,\" Anthony remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond looked exasperated. \"For God\u0027s sake,\" he muttered. \"Look at our leader now.\" A slow grin settled on his face before he added, \"Why, Duncan couldn\u0027t kill a lamb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, it was humiliating. Edmond had obviously heard Madelyne call his stallion her lamb.. Everyone probably heard, and if they hadn\u0027t, Edmond would certainly tell them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would seem, Anthony, our captive has turned captor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in no mood for your riddles, Edmond,\" Duncan muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in no mood for admitting you love Madelyne either. Look at your condition, brother, and the truth will hit you between the eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond shook his head, turned, and slowly walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne\u0027s an easy woman to love, Baron,\" Anthony commented when they were again alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy? As easy as swallowing a mace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were completely ill suited for each other. He was as rigid as a trunk of an old tree. Madelyne was as flighty as the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he never stood a chance… not since the moment she touched his feet. Duncan knew that now. Lord, he did love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll not have chaos in my life.\" Duncan made the proclamation as a fervent vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, in time, all will settle—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Madelyne is too old to get out of bed,\" Duncan interrupted. \"Then I\u0027ll have peace again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peace can be boring,\" Anthony commented with a smile. \"Your wife has given new life to your home, Duncan.\" Anthony sought to appease Duncan with his argument\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe concluded, from the way Duncan scowled, that his plan wasn\u0027t working. Perhaps his lord had only just realized how much Madelyne meant to him. If that was the situation, Anthony decided his baron wasn\u0027t taking the realization well at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to leave Duncan to his own thoughts, excused himself with a bow, and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was glad for the solitude. He kept picturing his stallion racing toward his gentle little wife, knowing he\u0027d never forget the horror for as long as he lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d captured his horse just as she\u0027d captured him. Duncan found his first smile when he realized what a feat Madelyne had accomplished. Edmond was right. Madelyne was captor now, for she owned his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was surprising strength with the truth. Duncan suddenly felt as though he\u0027d just ended a forty-day fast. He wasn\u0027t going to have to ignore Madelyne any longer. Aye, he could feast on her. Besides, he admitted, it was past time he took a firm hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started after his wife, thinking he would lecture her awhile, then kiss her. He was still angry. It was her fault, of course. She was the one who\u0027d made his heart start pounding. She\u0027d scared the hell out of him. He didn\u0027t like that feeling, not at all. He wasn\u0027t used to loving either. The first would take time to get over, the second would take time to adjust to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shout stopped him. Fergus, soldier in charge of the south watch, called out a warning that a visitor was approaching the fortress. From the colors displayed on the banner waving in the breeze, the watchman knew that Baron Gerald and his assembly wished entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all Duncan needed to turn his day completely black. Damn, he had sent a messenger to Gerald with the full explanation of Adela\u0027s condition. He assumed Gerald would have sent a messenger back with agreement to nullify the contract. Obviously, because Gerald had troubled to journey such a distance, there was still a problem to be solved before the betrothal could be set aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, he was going to have to be diplomatic. And Adela would probably revert to her crazed condition when she learned her intended was here for a visit. Duncan realized he might be jumping to conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerald was an old friend. There could be a number of reasons for the baron to visit. Lord, Madelyne was affecting him more than he\u0027d realized. He was beginning to take on her flaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gifted with affecting his concentration too. Why, only two days ago he\u0027d been in the middle of issuing an important command to his men, when his wife had strolled into his line of vision. Duncan suddenly found himself watching the gentle sway of her h*ps as she walked by, forgetting all about the order he was giving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan smiled over that memory. The soldiers had been staring at him so expectantly, and there he stood, without a glimmer of an idea what he was telling them, probably looking quite stupid, until Gilard stepped forward and reminded him of their topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFergus shouted to Duncan again, interrupting his concentration. Duncan immediately gave the order to let Baron Gerald inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was just coming out of the stables when Duncan intercepted her. Without giving her any sort of proper greeting, he abruptly stated his order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adela\u0027s inside, Madelyne. Go and tell her Baron Gerald is here. She\u0027ll greet him at dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s eyes widened over Duncan\u0027s startling news. \"Why is he here, Duncan? Did you send for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not,\" Duncan answered, irritated she didn\u0027t immediately pick up her skirts and run to do his bidding. He was standing close enough to kiss her, and that thought fully consumed him. \"Now, do as I\u0027ve instructed, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always do what you instruct,\" Madelyne answered with a smile. She turned, started to walk toward the castle. \"And good day to you too, Duncan,\" she called back over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a disrespectful comment meant to remind him of his lack of manners, Duncan supposed. He told himself it was too bad there wasn\u0027t time to throttle her senseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped as soon as he called out to her, yet didn\u0027t turn around until he commanded it. \"Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne complied, frowning now, for her husband\u0027s voice had sounded very tender. \"Yes, Duncan?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan cleared his throat, frowned, and then said, \"Good afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t even meant to say that, had he? Duncan frowned all the more when Madelyne smiled. Duncan suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too stunned to respond at first. Duncan had never touched her during the day. Why, he always ignored her. He wasn\u0027t ignoring her now, however. Nay, he was kissing her quite forcefully, and in clear view of anyone who might be passing by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss wasn\u0027t gentle either, but passionately arousing. Just when she was getting the way of it, Duncan pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her. \"Don\u0027t ever call my horse your lamb again. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne stared up at Duncan, looking confused and flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could form an answer, Duncan walked away from her. Madelyne picked up her skirts and chased after him. She grabbed hold of his hand, stopping him with her touch, and when he turned to look at her, he was still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ill, Duncan?\" Madelyne asked. Fear sounded in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you smiling so?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shook his head. \"Madelyne, please go and tell Adela about Gerald\u0027s arrival,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please?\" Madelyne asked. She looked appalled. \"You\u0027ve told me to please—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne, do as I\u0027ve ordered,\" Duncan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded but didn\u0027t move. Madelyne just stood there, watching Duncan walk away from her. She was too stunned to go after him again. Duncan had always been so predictable. Now he was trying to change on her. She wrung her hands together while she worried about that. Had it been a hot summer day, she would have believed the sun had baked his head. Since it was January, however, and as cold as purgatory, Madelyne couldn\u0027t find any acceptable excuse for his sudden turnabout in attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed time to think. Madelyne sighed and tried to dismiss her husband\u0027s unusual behavior from her thoughts. She hurried in search of Adela then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to dismiss Duncan was easier said than done. Why, it would have been less difficult to walk across a bed of nails barefoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdela did help take Madelyne\u0027s mind off her husband. Duncan\u0027s little sister was in her bedroom. She was sitting on the side of the bed, braiding her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have company, Adela,\" Madelyne announced cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdela was happy to see Madelyne until she heard who company was. \"I\u0027m staying in this room until he leaves,\" Adela shouted. \"Duncan gave me his word. How could he ask Gerald to come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne could see how frightened Adela was. Her hands fell to her lap and her shoulders sagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan didn\u0027t invite Gerald. Don\u0027t get upset, Adela. You know your brother won\u0027t break his promise. In your heart you know I speak the truth, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdela nodded. \"Maybe, if I act like I did when you first came here, then Gerald will be so disgusted he\u0027ll leave immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis foolish talk,\" Madelyne announced, squelching the spark of eagerness in Adela\u0027s eyes. \"Gerald will only think you\u0027re quite pitful. He just might think you haven\u0027t gotten over your incident,\" Madelyne said. \"If you look as pretty as you can and greet him respectfully, well, then I do believe he\u0027ll know your mind is set and you simply don\u0027t want to marry him. Besides, Duncan is the one who\u0027ll have to answer to Gerald, not you, Adela.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Madelyne, I can\u0027t face Gerald, I just can\u0027t,\" Adela cried out. \"He knows what happened to me. I\u0027ll die of shame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake,\" Madelyne answered, trying to sound exasperated. Inside, she ached for Adela. \"What happened wasn\u0027t your fault. Gerald knows that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdela didn\u0027t look relieved by Madelyne\u0027s argument, so she decided to turn the topic a little. \"Tell me what you remember about Baron Gerald. What does he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has black hair and hazel-colored eyes, I think,\" Adela answered, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he might be handsome then?\" Madelyne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barons aren\u0027t kind,\" Adela returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Madelyne asked. She walked over and started to rebraid Adela\u0027s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t have to be kind,\" Adela answered. \"What does it matter if he\u0027s pleasing to look at or not, Madelyne?\" She tried to turn around to look up at Madelyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be still, else your braid will be lopsided,\" Madelyne interjected. \"I was just curious about the baron, that is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go downstairs,\" Adela said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to cry. Madelyne wasn\u0027t sure what to do. \"You don\u0027t have to do anything you don\u0027t want to do, Adela. Duncan did give you his word, however, and it would seem to me that the least you could do to show your appreciation is to stand beside your brother and treat Gerald as an honored guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne had to keep up her argument for quite a while. In the end she was able to sway Adela. \"Will you go downstairs with me? Will you stay by my side?\" Adela asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I will,\" Madelyne promised. \"Remember, Adela. Together we can face any challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdela nodded. Madelyne sought to lighten her mood. \"I\u0027m afraid your braid is hanging over your ear,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll have to redo it, then change your gown. I must see to dinner arrangements and change my own clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne patted Adela on her shoulder. Her hands were shaking. She knew it was because Adela was so upset and had this new ordeal to go through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept smiling until she shut the door behind her. Then she let her worry show. Madelyne began to pray for what she believed would take a miracle. She prayed for courage. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-29.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:58 PM"}
