It\u0027s been downhill ever since. Which is why he just unloaded his freeloading wife and torched his own comic-book store-in one of the stupidest insurance scams in history. Enter Conner Samson. The down-on-his-luck repo man has just been hired to repossess Teddy\u0027s boat. Little does he know there\u0027s a baseball card on board that some men are willing to kill for. Thus begins a rip-roaring cross-country odyssey-and with bodies piling up, the squeeze is on for the penultimate piece of Americana. And Conner will be lucky if he ends up back where he started: broke and (still) breathing. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/suicide-squeeze.jpg","author":"Victor Gischler","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:46 PM"}
