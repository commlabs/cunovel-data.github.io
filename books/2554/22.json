He felt a little safer after he slid the surface-mounted bolt into place, but not much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a jarring experience. But it had answered a slew of questions, solved some nagging mysteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack and the One had met ... and the One had wanted to know more about Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man who had killed all those operatives Szeto had sent after the woman, stolen Thompson\u0027s Compendium, Tasered Ernst in Central Park, and done who knew what else ... all were the same person ... all were Jack the lawn-cutting teen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jack was working for the Enemy. Not only working, but looking for the One ... to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that raised another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy wasn\u0027t the Defender looking for the One? Why had an immortal sent a mortal to kill a fellow immortal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no sense unless ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst remembered his bizarre last meeting with the One. He had been enraged that the Jihad virus had not had the desired effect, and yet quite literally giddy - had actually laughed - about an unspecified event. He could hear his voice again as if he were in the room ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... something wonderful happened yesterday. Something I should have suspected, but never dreamed possible ... something that changes everything\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;... at last I can take direct action ... take matters into my own hands. I will finish this myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo obstacles had stood in the path between the One and bringing about the Change: the Defender and the Lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo question that the Lady remained - Szeto\u0027s failed attempt on her life proved that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... At last I can take direct action ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all the One\u0027s moves against the Lady, he had stayed out of the picture, kept his hand hidden. Even with the Fhinntmanchca, he had remained in the background, orchestrating the attack through the Order and the Dormentalists and the Kickers. He had never taken direct action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he felt he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had changed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Defender? Had something happened to him? That might explain why Jack was so openly searching for the One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Defender was out of the picture - and really, that was a question being asked with increasing frequency over the years in the upper echelons of the Order: Where was the Defender?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the months since the Fhinntmanchca debacle, it had become an incessant buzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn\u0027t the Defender stepped in - if not in time to stop it, then at least making himself known afterward? The incident should have goaded him into some sort of action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no ... nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Defender hadn\u0027t been heard from since the dawn of World War II when it appeared he\u0027d slain the One. No need for him to do anything after that. But then came the One\u0027s reincarnation in 1968. He could have - should have - acted then. Countless opportunities to snuff out the One for good must have presented themselves during the years he was growing to manhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut again ... nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it possible he\u0027d been killed in the war? Caught in Dresden during the firebombing, perhaps? In the wrong place when a V2 smashed into London during the battle of Britain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the reason, the Defender had been conspicuous by his absence. And now Jack was taking on the task that should be the Defender\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Americans liked to say: What\u0027s wrong with this picture?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... Something I should have suspected, but never dreamed possible ... something that changes everything\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat \"something\" could only be that the Defender was no longer around. Which would indeed leave the One free to take direct action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ... all that stood between the One and the Lady now was a lone mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack didn\u0027t stand a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr did he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that why the One had been asking about him? He couldn\u0027t possibly fear Jack ... could he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason Jack seemed to think he could bring it off. Ernst had gathered from their brief conversation that the intelligent boy he\u0027d known as a teen had not grown into a fool, so why did he think he could win? Did he know something Ernst didn\u0027t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he did succeed, the Change would be forestalled ... indefinitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that possibility brought back other things Jack had said, frightening things that had struck home ... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-22.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
