{"id":8066,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"2010 Hours, July 18, 2552 (Military Calendar) /Sigma Octanus IV, C.te d’AzurIt was time to arm the nuke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The small device held the power to destroy C.te d’Azur—wipe the Covenant infection clean off theplanet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John carefully removed the bonding strips on the HAVOK tactical nuclear device and attached it to thewall of the sewer. The adhesive on the black half sphere stuck and hardened to the concrete. He slippedthe detonator key into a thin slot on the unit’s face. There were no external indicators on the device;instead, a tiny screen winked on his heads-up display indicating the nuke was armed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HAVOK ARMED, flashed across his HUD. AWAITING DETONATION SIGNAL.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The device—a clean thirty-megaton explosive—could only be detonated by a remote signal . . . aproblem here in the sewers. Even the powerful communications package on a starship would be unableto penetrate the steel and concrete overhead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John quickly rigged a ground-return transceiver, placing it on the pipes overhead. He’d have to set upanother unit outside to relay the signal underground . . . a hot line that would trigger a nuclear firestorm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Technically, his mission parameters had been fulfilled. Green and Red Teams would have the civiliansevacuated soon. They had scouted the region and discovered a new Covenant species—the strangefloating creature that disassembled and reassembled human machinery, like a scientist or engineerstripping down a device to learn its secrets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could leave and destroy the Covenant occupation force. Heshould leave—there was an army ofJackals and Grunts—including at least a platoon of the black-armored veterans—on the streets above.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were three medium Covenant dropships hovering in the air as well. The advance Marine strikeforces had been slaughtered, leaving the Spartans no backup. His responsibility now was to make surehis team got out intact.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But John’s orders had an unusual amount of flexibility . . . and that made him uncomfortable. He hadbeen told to reconnoiter the region and gather intelligence on the Covenant. He was positive there wasmore to be learned here.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Certainly they were up to something in C.te d’Azur’s museum. The Covenant had never before beeninterested in human history—or indeed, in humans or their artifacts of any kind. He had seen a disarmedJackal fight hand to hand rather than pick up a nearby human assault rifle. And the only thing theCovenant had ever used human buildings for was target practice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So finding out the reason they seized and were protecting the museum definitely qualified as intelligencegathering in his book.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was it worth exposing his team to find out? And if they died, would he be wasting their lives . . . orspending them for something worthwhile?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Master Chief?” Kelly whispered. “Our orders, sir?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He opened Blue Team’s COM channel. “We’re going in. Use your silencers. Don’t engage the enemyunless absolutely necessary. This place is too hot. We’ll just poke our noses in—see what they’re up toand bug out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three acknowledgment lights winked on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief knew they implicitly trusted his judgment. He just hoped he was worthy of that trust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans checked their gear and threaded silencers onto their assault rifles. They slipped silentlydown a wide side passage of the sewer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A rusty ladder ran up to the ceiling, and a steel plate had been welded in place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thermite paste already set up,” Fred reported.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Burn it.” The Master Chief stepped to the side and looked away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The thermite sputtered as bright as an electric arc welder, casting harsh shadows into the chamber. Whenit finished there was a jagged, glowing red circle in the steel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief climbed up the ladder and put his back against the plate—pushed. It popped free witha metallicsnap .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He eased the plate down and set it aside. He attached the fiber-optic probe, fed it up through the hole.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All clear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He flexed his leg muscles and sent the MJOLNIR armor up through the hole, pulling himself into thenext chamber with his left hand. His right hand held the silenced assault rifle as if it were no heavierthan a pistol. He braced for incoming enemy fire——Nothing happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He moved forward and surveyed the small room. The stone-walled chamber was dark, and was linedwith shelving units. Each unit held jars filled with clear liquid and insect specimens. Boxes and crateswere stacked neatly on the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly entered next, then Fred and James.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Picking up motion sensor signals,”Kelly said over the COM channel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Jam them.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Done,”she replied.“They may have gotten a piece of us, though.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Spread out,” the Master Chief ordered. “Get ready to jump back into the hole if this gets too hot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Otherwise, initiate the standard distract-and-destroy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The clatter of alien hooves on marble echoed behind a door to their right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans melted into the shadows. The Master Chief crouched behind a crate and unsheathed hiscombat knife.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door opened and four Jackals stood in the door frame; they held active energy shields in front ofthem—warping their already ugly vulture faces. The blue-white glow of the energy shield pulsedthrough the dark chamber.Good, the Master Chief thought.That should play hell with their night vision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Jackals held plasma pistols at the ready in their free hands; the barrels of the guns moved erraticallyas the aliens whispered to one another . . . then steadied as, in careful, slow movements, they moved in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The aliens fanned out into a rough “delta” formation—the lead Jackal a meter ahead of his compatriots.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The group approached the Master Chief’s hiding spot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a slight noise: the clink of glass bottles on the other side of the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Jackals turned . . . and presented their unshielded backs to the Master Chief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He exploded from his hiding place and jammed his blade into the base of the closest Jackal’s back. Hesnapped his right foot out, caught the back of the next Jackal’s head, crushing its skull.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The remaining aliens spun, glistening energy shields interposed between them and him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were three coughs from silenced MA5Bs. Alien blood—black in the harsh blue-white light—spattered across the inner surfaces of the energy shields as the silenced rounds found their marks. TheJackals toppled to the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief policed their plasma pistols and retrieved the shield generators clamped on theirforearms. He had standing orders to collect intact specimens of Covenant technology. The Office ofNaval Intelligence had not been able to replicate the Covenant’s shield technology. But they weregetting close.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the meantime, the Spartans would use these.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief strapped the curved piece of metal to his forearm. He touched one of the two largebuttons on the unit and a scintillating film appeared before him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He handed the other shield devices to his teammates.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He pressed the second button and the shield collapsed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t use these unless you have to,” he said. “The humming and their reflective surfaces might give usaway . . . and we don’t know how long they last.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He got three acknowledgment lights.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly and Fred took up positions on either side of the open door. She gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly took point and the Spartans moved, single file, up a circular stairwell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She paused a full ten seconds at the doorway to the main floor. She waved them ahead and they emergedon the main level of the museum.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The skeleton of a blue whale was suspended over the main foyer. The dead hulk reminded the MasterChief of a Covenant starship. He turned away from the distraction and slowly moved over the blackmarble tiles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oddly, there were no more Jackal patrols. There were a hundred Jackals outside guarding the place . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e but none inside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief didn’t like it. It didn’t feel right . . . and Chief Mendez had told him a thousand timesto trust his instincts. Was it a trap?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans staggered their line and moved cautiously into the east wing. There were displays of thelocal flora and fauna: gigantic flowers and fist-sized beetles. But their motion sensors were cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred halted . . . and then, with a quick hand signal, waved John to move up to his position.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood by a case of pinned butterflies. On the floor, facedown in front of that case, was a Jackal. Itwas dead, crushed flat. There was an imprint of a large boot where the creature’s back had been.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whatever had done this had easily weighed a ton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief spotted a few blood-smeared prints leading away from the Jackal . . . and into the westwing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He flipped on his infrared sensors and took a long look around—no heat sources here or in the nearbyrooms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief followed the footprints and signaled the team to follow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The west wing held scientific displays. There were static electric generators and quantum fieldholograms on the walls, a tapestry of darting arrows and wriggling lines. A cloud chamber sat in thecorner with subatomic tracers zipping through its misty confines—the Master Chief noted it wasunusually active. This place reminded him of Déjà’s classroom on Reach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A branch opened to another wing. The word GEOLOGY was carved on the entry arch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Through that arch there was a strong infrared source, a razor-thin line that shot straight up and out of thebuilding. The Master Chief only caught a glimpse of the thing—a wink and a blink then it was goneagain . . . it was so bright his IR sensors overloaded and automatically shut down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waved James to take the left side of the arch. He had Kelly and Fred drop back to cover their flanks,and the Master Chief edged to the right of the arch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sent a fiber-optic probe ahead, bent it slightly, and poked it around the corner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The room contained display cases of mineral specimens. There were sulfur crystals, raw emeralds, andrubies. There was a monolith of unpolished pink quartz in the center of the room, three meters wide andsix tall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Off to one side, however, were two creatures. The Master Chief hadn’t seen them at first—because theywere so motionless . . . and so massive. He had no doubt that one of them had crushed the Jackal thathad gotten in its way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief got scared all the time. He never showed it, though. He usually mentallyacknowledged the apprehension, put it aside, and continued . . . just as he’d been trained to do. Thistime, however, he couldn’t easily dismiss the feeling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two creatures were vaguely man-shaped. They stood two and a half meters tall. It was difficult tomake out their features; they were covered from head to toe with a dull blue-gray armor, similar to thehull of a Covenant ship. Blue, orange, and yellow highlights were visible on the few patches of exposedskin the creatures sported. They had slits where their eyes should be. The articulation points lookedimpregnable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On their left arms they hefted large shields, thick as starship battleplate. Mounted on their right armswere massive, wide-barreled weapons, so large that the arm beneath seemed to blend into the weapon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They moved with slow deliberation. One took a rock from the display case and set it inside a red metalcase. It bent over the case while the other turned and touched the control panel of a device that lookedlike a small pulse laser turret. The laser pointed straight up—and out through the shattered glass domeoverhead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That had been the source of the infrared radiation. The laser must have intermittently scattered off thedust in the air—flashed enough energy into his sensors to burn them out. Something that powerful couldbeam a message straight out into space.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief made a slow fist—the signal for his team to freeze. Then, with slow, deliberatemovements, he signaled the Spartans to stay alert and get ready.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waved Fred and Kelly forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred crept closer to him. Kelly slid up next to James.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief then held up two fingers and made a sideways cut, motioning them into the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Acknowledgment lights winked on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He went in first, sidestepped to the right, with Fred at his side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James and Kelly took the left flank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They opened fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Armor-piercing rounds pinged off the aliens’ body armor. One of them turned and brought its shield infront of it—covering its partner, the red case, and the laser beacon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartan bullets didn’t even leave a scratch on the armor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The alien raised its arm slightly and pointed at Kelly and James.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A flash of light blinded the Master Chief. There was a deafening explosion and a wave of heat. Heblinked for a full three seconds before he recovered his vision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where Kelly and James had been there was a burning crater that fanned backward . . . nothing butcharcoal and ash remained of the Science Chamber behind them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly had moved in time; she crouched five meters deeper into the room, still firing. James was nowhereto be seen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other massive creature turned to face the Master Chief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He hit the button on the shield generator on his arm and brought it up just in time—the nearest alien’sweapon flashed again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The air in front of the Master Chief shimmered and exploded—he flew backward, crashing through thewall, and skidded for ten meters before slamming into the wall of the next room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Jackal shield generator was white-hot. The Master Chief ripped the melted alien device off andthrew it away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Those plasma bolts were like nothing he had seen before. They seemed almost as powerful as thestationary plasma cannons the Jackals used.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief sprang to his feet and charged back into the chamber.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If the aliens’ weapons were similar to Covenant plasma guns, they would need to be recharged. Hehoped the Spartans had enough time to take those things out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief still felt the fear—it was stronger than it had been before . . . but his team was still inthere. He had to take care of them first before he could indulge in the luxury of feelings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly and Fred circled the creatures, their silenced weapons firing quick bursts. They ran out ofammunition and switched clips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This wasn’t working. They couldn’t take them out. Maybe a Jackhammer missile at point-blank rangewould penetrate their armor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief’s gaze was drawn to the center of the room. He stared for a moment at the monolith ofpink quartz.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Over the COM channel he ordered, “Switch to shredder rounds.” He changed ammunition and thenopened fire—at the floor underneath the enormous creatures’ feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly and Fred changed rounds and fired, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marble tiles shattered and the wood underneath splintered into toothpicks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of the creatures raised its arm again, preparing to fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Keep shooting,” John yelled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The floor creaked, buckled, and then fell away; the two massive aliens plunged into the basement below.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Quick,” the Master Chief said. He slung his rifle and moved to the back of the quartz monolith. “Push!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly and Fred leaned their weight against the stone and grunted with effort. The slab moved a tiny bit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James sprinted forward, slammed into the stone, put his shoulder alongside theirs . . . andpushed . Hisleft arm had been burned away from the elbow down, but he didn’t even whimper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The monolith moved; it inched toward the hole . . . then tilted and went over. It landed with a dull thudand a crunching noise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief peered over the edge. He saw an armored left leg, and on the other side of the stoneslab, an arm struggling underneath. The things were still alive. Their motions slowed, but they didn’tcease.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The red case was balanced precariously on the edge the hole. It teetered—no way to reach it in time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned to Kelly—the fastest Spartan—and yelled: “Grab it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The box fell——and Kelly leaped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a single bound, she caught the rock as the case dropped, she tucked, rolled, and got to her feet, therock safely held in one hand. She handed it to the Master Chief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The rock was a piece of granite and glittered with a few jewel-like inclusions. What was as so specialabout it? He stuffed it into his ammunition sack and then kicked over the Covenant transmission beacon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Outside, the Master Chief heard the clattering and squawking of the army of Jackals and Grunts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Let’s get out of here, Spartans.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He threw his arm around James and helped him along. They ran into the basement, making sure to givethe pinned giants under the stone a wide berth, then jumped through the storm drain and into the sewers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They jogged thought the muck and didn’t stop until they had cleared the drain system and emerged inthe rice paddies on the edge of C.te d’Azur.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred rigged the ground-return relay to the pipes overhead and ran a crude antenna outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief looked back at the city. Banshee fliers circled through the skyscrapers. Spotlights fromthe hovering Covenant transport ships bathed the streets in blue illumination. The Grunts were goingcrazy; their barks and screams rose to an impenetrable din.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans moved toward the coast and followed the tree line south. James collapsed twice along theway and then finally slipped into unconsciousness. The Master Chief slung him over him shoulder andcarried him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They paused and hid when they heard a patrol of a dozen Grunts. The aliens ran past them—they eitherdidn’t see the Spartans, or they didn’t care. The animals sprinted as fast as they could back to the city.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they were a click away from the rendezvous point, the Master Chief opened the COM link.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Green Team Leader, we’re on your perimeter, and coming in. Signaling with blue smoke.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ready and waiting for you, sir,”Linda replied.“Welcome back.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief set off one of his smoke grenades and they marched into the clearing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Pelican was intact. Corporal Harland and his Marines stood post, and the rescued civilians weresafely inside the ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Blue and Red Teams were hidden in the nearby brush and trees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Linda approached them. She motioned for her team to take James and get him onto the Pelican. “Sir,”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e she said. “All civilians on board and ready for liftoff.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief wanted to relax, sit down, and close his eyes. But this was often the most dangerouspart of any mission . . . those last few steps when you might let down your guard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good. Take one more look around the perimeter. Let’s make double sure nothing followed us back.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corporal Harland approached and saluted. “Sir? How did you do it? Those civilians said you got themout of the city—past an army of Covenant, sir.
