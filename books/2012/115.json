Change them at will – it’s only a game in the skull, shaking the bones in the cup to see if something new shows up. Aye, I imagine such games are liberating, and the sense of leaving oneself behind is akin to moving house. A fresh start beckons. A new life, a new host of stories, a new mountain to build stone by stone .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ What makes you happy, Withal? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong stretches of time, Sand, free of alarm .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Nothing else? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, beauty, I suppose. Pleasure to caress the senses .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ You play at being a solid and simple man, Withal, but I think it is all an act. In fact, I think you think too much, about too many things. You’re worse than me. And before long, all that chaos gets so thick it starts looking solid, and simple .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoman, you make my head ache. I’m going for a walk .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing at his bruised hip, he brushed twigs and mud from his clothes, and then carefully made his way up the sinkhole’s side, grasping roots, finding footholds from the blocks of cut stone hiding in the gloom. Pulling himself clear, he resumed his journey down to the Shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty or more paces up from the strand, the forest edge had been transformed. Trees cut down, trenches dug in banked ripples facing the imminent breach in Lightfall. Figures swarming everywhere. Weapons in heaps – swords, spears and pikes – with Shake and Letherii crews busy scrubbing the rust from the ancient iron, rolling new grips from strips of soaked leather. The wood of the hafted weapons seemed to have been unaffected by the passage of time, the black shafts as strong as ever. Hundreds of helms formed vaguely disturbing mounds here and there, awaiting oil and refitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking his way past all this, Withal reached the strand. He paused, searching among the crowds. But he could not find the one he sought. Seeing a familiar face ahead, he called out, ‘Captain Pithy!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where is he?’ Withal asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened from the leather map she’d laid out on the sand, wiped sweat from her face, and then pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal looked in that direction. Saw a lone figure seated atop an old midden, facing Lightfall. With a wave to Pithy, he set off in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan Derryg was taking bites from a lump of cheese, his jaws working steadily as he studied the cascading light. He glanced over as Withal approached, but only briefly. Boots crunching on the ghastly white bone fragments of the beach, and then the slope of the midden, where amidst larger pieces of bone there were husks of some forest nut, more recent gourds and pieces of pottery, Withal reached the prince’s side, whereupon he sat down. ‘I didn’t know we had any cheese left.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan plopped the last bit into his mouth, chewed a moment, swallowed and then said, ‘We don’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal rubbed at his face. ‘I expect to feel the salt, the freshened sea breezes. Instead, the air feels as close as the hold of a ship.’ He nodded to Lightfall. ‘There is no breath from this, none at all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan grunted. ‘There will be soon enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The queen was wondering about that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wondering?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right. Fretting. Well, more like a cornered cat, come to think of it, so not fretting at all. Snarling, all claws out, fear blazing in her eyes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan’s jaws bunched, as if he was still chewing cheese, and then he said, ‘Is that what you wake up to every morning, Withal?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, squinted at Lightfall. ‘Never been married, have you? I can tell.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not much interested.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In any of that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In women.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. Well, among the Meckros, men marry each other all the time. I figure they see how men and women do it, and want that for themselves.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Want what, exactly?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Someone to be the cat, someone to be the dog, I suppose. But all official like.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And here I thought you’d go on about love and commitment, Withal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, it’s all down to who lifts a leg and who squats. And if you’re lucky, that goes back and forth. If you’re unlucky, you end up trapped in one or the other and life’s miserable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your winning description of marriage, Withal, has fallen somewhat short for me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sorry to hear that, Yedan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something to do, I suspect, with the lack of sincerity.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal grinned. ‘Anyway, the queen is eager for reassurance. Do you feel ready? And how … how soon?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-115.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
