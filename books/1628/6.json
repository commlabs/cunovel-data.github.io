Very wossname, comfy. If\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou try and knock me off, demon, you can wossname your ear goodbye. What a turn up for the scrolls, eh? They seemed to be expecting him.“ ”Why do you keep saying wossname?\" said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Limited wossname. Doodah. Thingy. You know. It\u0027s got words in it,” said the parrot. “Dictionary?” said Rincewind. They passengers in the other chariots had got out and were also groveling to Eric, who was beaming like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot considered this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, probably,” it said. “I\u0027ve got to wing it to you,” it went on. “I thought you were a bit of a wossname at the start, but you seem to be delivering the wossname.” “Demon?” said Eric, airily. “Yes?” “What are they saying? Can\u0027t you speak their language?” “Er, no,” said Rincewind. “I can read it, though,” he called out, as Eric turned away. \"If\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou could just sort of make signs for them to write it down...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was around noon. In the jungle behind Rincewind creatures whooped and gibbered. Mosquitoes the size of humming-birds whined around his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” he said, for the tenth time, “They\u0027ve never really got around to inventing paper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stonemason stood bake, handed the latest blunted obsidian chisel to his assistant, and gave Rincewind and expectant look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind stood back and examined the rock critically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s very good,” he said. “I mean, it\u0027s a very good likeness. You\u0027ve got his hairstyle and everything. Of course, he\u0027s not as, er, square as that normally but, yes, very good. And here\u0027s the chariot and there\u0027s the step-pyramids. Yes. Well, it looks as though they want you to go to the city with them,” he said to Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell them yes,” said Eric firmly. Rincewind turned to the headman. “Yes,” he said. “¿[Hunched-figure-in-triple-feathered-headdress-over-three-dots]?” Rincewind sighed. Without saying a word, the stonemason put a fresh stone chisel into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis unresisting fingers and manhandled a new slab of granite into position. One of the problems of being a Tezuman, apart from having a god like Quezovercoatl, is that if you unexpectedly need to order an extra pint of milk tomorrow you should have started writing the note last month. Tezumen are the only people who beat themselves to death with their own suicide notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon by the time the chariot trotted into the slab city around the largest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epyramid, between lines of cheering Tezumen. “This is more like it,” said Eric, graciously acknowledging the cheers. “They\u0027re very pleased to see us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Rincewind, gloomily. “I wonder why?” “Well, because I\u0027m the new ruler, of course.” “Hmm.” Rincewind glanced sidelong at the parrot, who had been unnaturally silent for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome time and was now cowering up against his ear like an elderly spinster in a strip\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclub. It was having serious thoughts about the exquisite feather headdresses. “Wossname bastards,” it croaked. “Any wossname lays a hand on me and that wossname is minus one finger, I\u0027m telling you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s something not right about this,” said Rincewind. “What\u0027s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m telling you, one feather out of place -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind wasn\u0027t used to people being pleased to see him. It was unnatural, and boded no good. These people were not only cheering, they were throwing flowers and hats. The hats were made out of stone, but the thought was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind thought they were rather odd hats. They didn\u0027t have crowns. They were, in fact, mere discs with holes in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe procession trotted up the wide avenues of the city to a cluster of buildings at the foot of the pyramid, where another group of dignitaries was waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were wearing lots of jewelry. It was all basically the same. There are quite a lot of uses to which you can put a stone disc with a hole in the middle, and the Tezumen had explored all but one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore important, though, were the boxes and boxes of treasure stacked in front of them. They were stuffed with jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric\u0027s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The tribute!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind gave up. It was really working. He didn\u0027t know why, but at last it was all going Right. The setting sun glinted off a dozen fortunes. Of course, it belonged to Eric, presumably, but maybe there was enough for him too...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Naturally,” he said weakly. “What else did you expect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was feasting, and long speeches that Rincewind couldn\u0027t understand but which were punctuated with cheers and nods and bows in Eric\u0027s direction. And there were long recitals of Tezuman music, which sounds like someone clearing a particularly difficult nostril.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind left Eric sitting proudly enthroned in the firelight and wandered disconsolately across to the pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was enjoying the wossname,” said the parrot reproachfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t settle down,” said Rincewind. “I\u0027m sorry, but this sort of thing has never happened to me before. All the jewels and things. Everything going as expected. It\u0027s not right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up the monstrous face of the steep pyramid, red and flickering in the firelight. Every huge block was carved with a bas-relief of Tezumen doing terribly inventive things to their enemies. It suggested that the Tezumen, whatever sterling qualities they possessed, were not traditionally inclined to welcome perfect strangers and heap them with jewels. The overall effect of the great heap of carvings was very artistic - it was just the details that were horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile working his way along the wall he came to a huge door, which artistically portrayed a group of prisoners apparently being given a complete medical check-up*. (*From a distance it did, anyway. Close to, no.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt opened into a short, torch-lit tunnel. Rincewind took a few steps along it, telling himself he could always hurry out again, and came out into a lofty space which occupied most of the inside of the pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more torches all around the walls, which illuminated everything quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t really welcome because what they mainly illuminated was a giant-sized statue of Quezovercoatl, the Feathered Boa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you had to be in a room with that statue, you\u0027d prefer it to be pitch black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, then again, perhaps not. A better option would be to put the thing in a darkened room while you had insomnia a thousand miles away, trying to forget what it looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just a statue, Rincewind told himself. It\u0027s not real. They\u0027ve just used their imagination, that\u0027s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the wossname is it?” said the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s their god.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get a way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really. It\u0027s Quezovercoatl. Half man, half chicken, half jaguar, half serpent, half\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escorpion and half mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot\u0027s beak moved as it worked this out. “That makes a wossname total of three homicidal maniacs,” it said. “About right, yes,” said the statue. “On the other hand,” said Rincewind instantly, \"I do think it\u0027s frightfully important for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople to have the right to worship in their own special way, and now I think we\u0027ll just be going, so just -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please don\u0027t leave me here,” said the statue. “Please take me with you.” “Could be tricky, could be tricky,” Rincewind said hurriedly, backing away. “It\u0027s not me, you understand, it\u0027s just that where I come from everyone has this racial prejudice against thirty-foot-high people with fangs and talons and necklaces of skulls all over them. I just think you\u0027ll have trouble fitting in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot tweaked his ear. “It\u0027s coming from behind the statue, you stupid wossname,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit croaked. It turned out to be coming from a hole in the floor. A pale face peered short-sightedly up at Rincewind from the depths of a pit. It was an elderly, good-natured face with a faintly worried expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hallo?” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t know what it means to hear a friendly voice again,” said the face, breaking into a grin. “If you could just sort of help me up...?” “Sorry?” said Rincewind. “You\u0027re a prisoner, are you?” “Alas, this is so.” “I don\u0027t know that I ought to go around rescuing prisoners just like that,” said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind. “I mean, you might have done anything.” “I am entirely innocent of all crimes, I assure you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, well, so you say,” said Rincewind gravely. “But if the Tezumen have judged -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wossname, wossname, wossname!” shrieked the parrot in his ear as it bounced up and down on his shoulder. “Haven\u0027t you got the faintest? Where\u0027ve you been? He\u0027s a prisoner! A prisoner in a temple! You\u0027ve got to rescue prisoners in temples! That\u0027s what they\u0027re bloody there for!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No it isn\u0027t,” snapped Rincewind. “That\u0027s all you know! He\u0027s probably here to be sacrificed! Isn\u0027t that right?” He looked at the prisoner for confirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face nodded. “Indeed, you are correct. Flayed alive in fact.” “There!” said Rincewind to the parrot. “See? You think you know everything! He\u0027s to be flayed alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every inch of skin removed to the accompaniment of exquisite pain,” added the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprisoner, helpfully. Rincewind paused. He thought he knew the meaning of the word “exquisite”, and it didn\u0027t seem to belong anywhere near “pain”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What, every bit?” he said. “This is apparently the case.” “Gosh. What was it you did?” The prisoner sighed. “You\u0027d never believe me...” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon King let the mirror darken and drummed his fingers on his desk for a moment. Then he picked up a speaking tube and blew into it. Eventually a distant voice said: “Yes, guv?” “Yes sir!” snapped the King The distant voice muttered something. “Yes, SIR?” it added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do we have a Quezovercoatl working here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll see, guv.” The voice faded, came back. “Yes, guv.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he a Duke, Earl, Count or Baron?” said the King. “No, guv.” “Well, what is he?” There was a long silence at the other end. “Well?” said the King “He\u0027s no-one much, guv” The King glared at the tube for some time. You try, he thought. You make proper plans,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou try to get organised, you try to help people, and this is what you get. “Send him to see me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the music rose to a crescendo and stopped. The fires crackled. From the distant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejungles a thousand glowing eyes watched the proceedings. The high priest stood up and made a speech. Eric beamed like a pumpkin. A long line of Tezumen brought baskets of jewels which they scattered before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the high priest made a second speech. This one seemed to end in a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” said Eric. “Jolly good. Keep it up.” He scratched his ear and ventured, “You can all have a half holiday.” The high priest repeated the question again, in a slightly impatient tone of voice. “I\u0027m the one, yes,” said Eric, just in case they were unclear. “You\u0027ve got it exactly right.” The high priest spoke again. This time there was no slightly about it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-6.html","bookId":1628,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM"}
