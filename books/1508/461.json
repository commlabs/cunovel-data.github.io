They were both third stage Life Destruction masters. Although he feared Nanyun Wang a bit, it wasn’t excessively so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was said Nanyun Wang was originally a martial artist from the common mortal world and lived a bleak and desolate life. However, he seemed to have encountered some sort of heaven defying chance, and experienced a meteoric rise to glory. Afterwards, he joined a third-grade sect within the South Sea.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of Nanyun Wang’s overwhelming talent, that third-grade sect had placed the utmost importance on him, not sparing any resources in raising him. They hoped that one day in the future, Nanyun Wang would soar into the heavens and lead their sect to becoming a fourth-grade sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever… every so often, a sect’s destiny simply wasn’t equal to the destiny of its geniuses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNanyun Wang had amazing talent. However, as a result of his talent being too high, when Nanyun Wang was at the Xiantian realm, he had provoked a great number of Revolving Core masters, finally bringing a calamity onto his sect. That third-grade sect was completely obliterated, and as for Nanyun Wang, he managed to escape, growing until he became a third stage Life Destruction powerhouse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis Nanyun Wang seemed to incomparably long for an emperor’s life. He build a palace and filled it with a harem of 3000 beautiful concubines. On the body of each of these women, he had placed a restricting spell. Every day, Nanyun Wang would summoned four or five concubines into his palace to serve him. When he travelled, he would have golden guards clearing his way and a bevy of beautiful maids attending to his every need.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, this Nanyun Wang had always been a martial artist of the demonic path who followed his heart. Thus, all of this reckless behavior didn’t affect his heart of martial arts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Since everyone has arrived, let’s open the space channel.” The one speaking was the abbot of the Great Zen Temple. This elderly monk wore a golden-threaded cassock and held a staff in his hands. His two large ears drooped like two big jugs and his white brows hung down to his shoulders. Whether it was waiting or the arrival of Nanyun Wang, this white-browed monk didn’t have any change in expression. He was in meditation with his eyes closed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let us do as master says. For now let us join our strength and open up the space channel. If we delay any further, there might be more troubles that occur.” Xuan Yuqie tenderly smiled. Although she hated these fellows that came to steal all her goods, she didn’t have any good reason to reject them. With just their South Sea Demon Region’s people, it was simply impossible for them to open up the Demon God Imperial Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMore than 30 Revolving Core and Life Destruction Supreme Elders floated down, falling into the central space vortex of South Aurora Island.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe swirling space vortex that was able to instantly rip apart a peak Houtian master was just like a gust of wind against these Revolving Core and Life Destruction masters; it only gently lifted their clothes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter these masters went down, the Five Element Region’s seven sects, Divine Phoenix Island, and the South Sea Demon Region disciples quickly entered into the swirling space vortex. These disciples were the younger heroic elites that had been chosen to come.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis broken world was the ruins of a sixth-grade sect. Naturally, there would be many treasures that were left behind. These things were scattered through the broken world. Thus, the various factions had all reached a tacit understanding that the juniors of these factions would be able to enter to adventure and experience.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery sect had a quota of disciples they could bring based on their power; they could only bring a few, not too many. Divine Phoenix Island had brought around 30 people. Lin Ming and Mu Qianyu were among them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, Yu’er, you two be careful. Don’t separate and remember to take care of each other. In this foray into the ancient battlefield, there will inevitably be life or death battles!” Mu Yuhuang said to them with a true essence sound transmission as she entered into the swirling vortex. She had already said these words to them countless times before, urging them to be safe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Understood, Master.” The one who replied to Mu Yuhuang was a blue-clothed girl with delicate looks that weren’t too spectacular. This was Mu Qianyu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was an appearance changing technique that Lin Ming had passed on to her. These past five days, Lin Ming hadn’t done anything else besides assiduously teaching Mu Qianyu this technique.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Luo’s appearance changing technique had been found within some ancient ruins. Although it was strange, it wasn’t too difficult to learn, much less with Mu Qianyu’s natural talent and astonishing perception. In this few days she had been able to grasp its general concepts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu had a very sensitive status. There were many people from the South Sea Demon region that had her on their mind, wanting to obtain her. It would be easy for her to become a target. After changing her appearance, it would save everyone a great deal of trouble.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, let’s go.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of these young heroic elites of the major sects were like big fish as they dove into the swirling vortex of space. Lin Ming and Mu Qianyu appeared unremarkable among them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua la la –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming reentered the world shard of South Aurora Island, the first sound that he heard was torrential rainfall. It was like a vast waterfall pouring down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe air was filled with thick mist that had a slightly salty and bitter flavor. The vast amount of seawater that the space vortex had sucked up was already dozens of feet high. Between the heavens and earth, this misty world gave an extremely suppressive feeling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is…” As Mu Qianyu saw this scene she was startled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is the seawater that was sucked in by the space vortex.” Lin Ming had already expected this. Looking ahead, he could see many small and large whirlpools in the water, they were like the greedy maws of deadly vicious beasts. Lin Ming knew that under these whirlpools, there were the hidden deathtraps known as space cracks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis small and scattered world was filled with countless space cracks. Some of them had already collapsed onto themselves, sucking in the seawater and forming whirlpools.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was a massive amount of seawater that came in from the main space vortex, which was balanced out by the seawater that left from the space cracks. Otherwise, in these past five or six days, this broken little world would have already long been filled with seawater.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this heavy rain, visibility was very low. But all of the martial artists that came in were geniuses and masters. Their radiating sense of perception was not affected at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAmong the curtains of rain, a dim halo glowed, just like a lamp in a rainy night. Lin Ming placed a symbol paper on himself, and then a golden light completely surrounded him, reaching 50 feet around.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a symbol paper that wasn’t too special or complicated to make. But in this broken world, it was a life-saving treasure. As long as one approached a space crack, the countless glowing lights would be stirred by it, and the user would immediately be able to see the disturbance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter using this symbol paper, as long as they were slow and steady in their movements, they wouldn’t have any accidents.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn front of this crowd of people, the 30 plus top powerhouses led the way. To them, these space cracks weren’t much. As long as these old fellows joined forces, they could even open up channels in space. These trivial space cracks weren’t worth mentioning to them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, since they had to look after the juniors behind them, they couldn’t fly too quickly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe small broken world carved out from the main one wasn’t too large. Even though they were flying very slowly, they managed to reach the edge of the zone in about an hour.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHere, one could see that the vast amount of seawater suddenly vanished, as if it had been cut apart by an immeasurably sharp saber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s here!” Nanyun Wang lazily said. He was lying atop a flying carpet, his arms still grasping onto the bosom of a beautiful woman.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e “According to our position, this shouldn’t be wrong.” Xuan Wuji said. After these old fellows had discussed for the past several days, they had designated this area and route as the best entrance. If they made a space channel here, they would be able to save a great deal of strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Black Flood Dragon Clan Patriarch that had been flying a bit further back suddenly waved his hand. A massive column of water shot into the air, turning into a water-shaped flood dragon that roared and then shot forwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a banging sound, the water dragon smashed into an invisible wall and then immediately collapsed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Everyone, begin!

Yet, they only had this many second stage Life Destruction masters. From this, it could be seen just how difficult and treacherous the gate of death was that lay between the extreme Revolving Core realm and the Divine Sea realm. Every extreme Revolving Core master that came to this path had to be exceptionally cautious in traversing it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe white-browed monk flipped his hands and his monk staff flew out.
