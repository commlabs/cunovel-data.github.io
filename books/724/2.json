We were going to have roast pork for dinner with boiled potatoes and what Andrew calls Vandyke brown gravy. Andrew had driven over to town to get some flour and feed and wouldn\u0027t be back till noontime. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Being a Monday, Mrs. McNally, the washerwoman, had come over to take care of the washing. I remember I was just on my way out to the wood pile for a few sticks of birch when I heard wheels turn in at the gate. There was one of the fattest white horses I ever saw, and a queer wagon, shaped like a van. A funny-looking little man with a red beard leaned forward from the seat and said something. I didn\u0027t hear what it was, I was looking at that preposterous wagon of his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was coloured a pale, robin\u0027s-egg blue, and on the side, in big scarlet letters, was painted:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; R.

The van had a raised skylight on the roof, something like an old-fashioned trolley car; and from one corner went up a stove pipe. At the back was a door with little windows on each side and a flight of steps leading up to it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As I stood looking at this queer turnout, the little reddish man climbed down from in front and stood watching me. His face was a comic mixture of pleasant drollery and a sort of weather-beaten cynicism. He had a neat little russet beard and a shabby Norfolk jacket.

As he spoke he released a hook somewhere, and raised the whole side of his wagon like a flap. Some kind of catch clicked, the flap remained up like a roof, displaying nothing but books—rows and rows of them. The flank of his van was nothing but a big bookcase. Shelves stood above shelves, all of them full of books—both old and new.

Books\u0027ll be the ruin of this farm pretty soon. He\u0027s mooning about over his books like a sitting hen about half the time, when he ought to be mending harness. Lord, if he saw this wagonload of yours he\u0027d be unsettled for a week. I have to stop the postman down the road and take all the publishers\u0027 catalogues out of the mail so that Andrew don\u0027t see \u0027em.

He certainly had a pretty miscellaneous collection. I noticed poetry, essays, novels, cook books, juveniles, school books, Bibles, and what not—all jumbled together.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, see here,\" said the little man—and about this time I noticed that he had the bright eyes of a fanatic—\"I\u0027ve been cruising with this Parnassus going on seven years. I\u0027ve covered the territory from Florida to Maine and I reckon I\u0027ve injected about as much good literature into the countryside as ever old Doc Eliot did with his five-foot shelf. I want to sell out now. I\u0027m going to write a book about \u0027Literature Among the Farmers,\u0027 and want to settle down with my brother in Brooklyn and write it. I\u0027ve got a sackful of notes for it. I guess I\u0027ll just stick around until Mr. McGill gets home and see if he won\u0027t buy me out. I\u0027ll sell the whole concern, horse, wagon, and books, for $400. I\u0027ve read Andrew McGill\u0027s stuff and I reckon the proposition\u0027ll interest him. I\u0027ve had more fun with this Parnassus than a barrel of monkeys. I used to be a school teacher till my health broke down. Then I took this up and I\u0027ve made more than expenses and had the time of my life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Mr. Mifflin,\" I said, \"if you want to stay around I guess I can\u0027t stop you.

Andrew is just as unpractical and fanciful as a young girl, and always dreaming of new adventures and rambles around the country. If he ever saw that travelling Parnassus he\u0027d fall for it like snap. And I knew Mr. Decameron was after him for a new book anyway. (I\u0027d intercepted one of his letters suggesting another \"Happiness and Hayseed\" trip just a few weeks before. Andrew was away when the letter came. I had a suspicion what was in it; so I opened it, read it, and—well, burnt it. Heavens! as though Andrew didn\u0027t have enough to do without mooning down the road like a tinker, just to write a book about it.)\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As I worked around the kitchen I could see Mr. Mifflin making himself at home. He unhitched his horse, tied her up to the fence, sat down by the wood pile, and lit a pipe. I could see I was in for it. By and by I couldn\u0027t stand it any longer. I went out to talk to that bald-headed pedlar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"See here,\" I said. \"You\u0027re a pretty cool fish to make yourself so easy in my yard.

If you move me on from here, of course I\u0027ll go; but I warn you I shall lie in wait for Mr. McGill just down this road. I\u0027m here to sell this caravan of culture, and by the bones of Swinburne I think your brother\u0027s the man to buy it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My blood was up now, and I\u0027ll admit that I said my next without proper calculation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Rather than have Andrew buy your old parcheesi,\" I said, \"I\u0027ll buy it myself.

He didn\u0027t either accept or decline my offer. (I was frightened to death that he\u0027d take me right on the nail and bang would go my three years\u0027 savings for a Ford.)\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come and have another look at her,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I must admit that Mr. Roger Mifflin had fixed up his van mighty comfortably inside. The body of the wagon was built out on each side over the wheels, which gave it an unwieldy appearance but made extra room for the bookshelves. This left an inside space about five feet wide and nine long. On one side he had a little oil stove, a flap table, and a cozy-looking bunk above which was built a kind of chest of drawers—to hold clothes and such things, I suppose; on the other side more bookshelves, a small table, and a little wicker easy chair. Every possible inch of space seemed to be made useful in some way, for a shelf or a hook or a hanging cupboard or something. Above the stove was a neat little row of pots and dishes and cooking usefuls. The raised skylight made it just possible to stand upright in the centre aisle of the van; and a little sliding window opened onto the driver\u0027s seat in front. Altogether it was a very neat affair. The windows in front and back were curtained and a pot of geraniums stood on a diminutive shelf. I was amused to see a sandy Irish terrier curled up on a bright Mexican blanket in the bunk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Miss McGill,\" he said, \"I couldn\u0027t sell Parnassus for less than four hundred.

The whole thing\u0027s yours for $400—including dog, cook stove, and everything—jib, boom, and spanker. There\u0027s a tent in a sling underneath, and an ice box (he pulled up a little trap door under the bunk) and a tank of coal oil and Lord knows what all. She\u0027s as good as a yacht; but I\u0027m tired of her. If you\u0027re so afraid of your brother taking a fancy to her, why don\u0027t you buy her yourself and go off on a lark?
