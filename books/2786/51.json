I chuckle when I realize just how aroused she still is, but abandon teasing her soon after. She doesn\u0027t even glare at me, making it obvious just how much she\u0027s still in her role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027m done, I pick her up and carry her into the bedroom where Jazz is waiting for us, about as tired as Bella but a lot less strung out. He scoots over when I put her down onto the mattress, then pulls her to him and I crawl under the covers to join them. Like the last time we ended up here together, Bella is content to find herself between us, laughing softly when I nibble on the side of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz watches us for awhile before he clears his throat, drawing our attention back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was unexpected, but I can\u0027t say I feel like complaining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good for you!\" Bella huffs, already sounding a lot more like her usual self. It\u0027s funny to watch her use him to pull herself back together, although part of me resents that she feels the need to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll do it again?\" I want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz hesitates but then nods, although a slight frown remains on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you ditch the cane completely next time, okay.\" Bella must have made a face for he backtracks almost immediately, adding a quick, \"When it comes to my ass, I mean, feel free to work her over as much as she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now why does that still sound like you\u0027re trying to convince yourself you\u0027re okay with that?\" I remark dryly, getting a hard look from him in return that somehow amuses me even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m trying, can\u0027t teach a dog new tricks overnight! But I have to admit, watching your face light up with intensity while you were making her scream and writhe was a lot more of a turn-on than I expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t even noticed that he was watching me, but stranger things have happened, and his observation leaves me smiling back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you won\u0027t run the next time if I\u0027m getting out the heavy guns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he\u0027s looking properly cowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, this wasn\u0027t what you consider, ah, heavy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even have to answer; Bella does it for me when she starts to laugh, rocking us both with the motion of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious? Jazz, this wasn\u0027t really that much more than we did last spring in the woods! Okay, this time you were on the receiving side of things, too, but Edward didn\u0027t really hurt me. Sure I might have groaned and grunted a little, and shouted a few times, but that\u0027s nothing. Look at my ass, I don\u0027t even have any real marks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz seems stunned at her revelation, then actually checks her butt, only finding a residual reddening of the skin but not a single welt that survived long enough to still show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy now?\" she asks, still laughing, before she curls into my embrace again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess. It just seemed more vicious while it was happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s part of the game as we play it,\" I admit, amused by how long it takes him to discern reality from acting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although some parts of it were pretty rough. Like when you were trying to shove me right through the floor while you were fucking me. It\u0027s funny that you were all about trying to lend strength to me when Edward went a little enthusiastic with the cane, but you didn\u0027t seem to realize just what problems you were causing with your own body weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz looks downright guilty at hearing that, a clear admission that she\u0027s right in her assessment, but before Bella can drive the point home, I interject to put them both more at ease again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why it was my call to stop it or let you go on. Getting caught up in the moment happens to everyone, but if you let it happen, you better make sure beforehand that you won\u0027t injure your partner for real, or that someone is close by to keep track of what\u0027s going on with you. There\u0027s a reason why you need to learn things from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella nods, a little sheepish at her previous words, then adds, \"Plus, it\u0027s kind of a huge advantage to have someone handy who can drive me crazy with his tongue on my clit so you can beat my ass soundly without having to stop to do that whole pesky jerking me off yourself. Must be so much easier this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think it\u0027s easier to be in control of two people at the same time compared to just one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe huffs, her eyes taking on that playful glint that makes it obvious that she\u0027s up to something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not easier, but it can\u0027t be that hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you try it yourself then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the words leave my lips I realize that must have been her goal from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a great idea, and coming so out of the blue!\" she simpers, then laughs when first I, then Jazz, look quizzically at her. \"What, are you afraid I\u0027m going to take revenge on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thought might have crossed my mind,\" Jazz admitted, making her laugh a little wickedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see. It\u0027s not like a small woman like me can force two hunks like you to do anything against their wills, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, I kiss her, drowning out her laughter. And true enough, my cock isn\u0027t the only part of me already looking forward to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not surprised that once the emotional roller coaster that was our Thanksgiving weekend is over, the days leading up to Christmas seem to zoom by. Maybe it\u0027s also because those days are among the best I\u0027ve had in a very long time, even though at times I feel a little guilty about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I\u0027m not surprised at is how easily Jazz integrates himself into our daily lives again. In hindsight, the full impact of just how much I missed him while he was gone is immense, and seeing Bella act as happy and carefree as I do helps me feel a little less like I\u0027m betraying her. Which I am sure I\u0027m not, but having spent months locked inside my own head thinking about my issues with him has left its mark, and it takes more than a few rounds of fucking and a nasty Scrabble tournament to leave all that behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, the universe hasn\u0027t gotten the memo that we would appreciate it if everything around us were to stop so we could celebrate our reunion in all sorts of ways; the time I actually end up spending with Bella and Jazz is very limited. I secretly lament that fact but try to be a good sport about it every time I slink off to the hospital. I am ecstatic when, only days before Christmas, I head home from my shift at work, and get a text message on the way that is as cryptic as it is promising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cullen, the college library would like to remind you of your 6:30 appoint ment at Ms. Swan\u0027s office. Please be on time and bring your overdue book s with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally arrive home, I find the living room deserted. Taped to my intended microwave lunch-slash-dinner is a small, folded paper, covered in Bella\u0027s hasty scrawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy the pasta! I don\u0027t think I have to remind you to get yourself ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClothes are on the bed. I\u0027m out with Jazz to get some last minute stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove, B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat explains why I\u0027m on my own with just under an hour until the designated starting time of our planned scene, and I feel a little cheated of the chance to share my excitement with the only two people who might really get it on every level. Trying not to dwell on that, though, I eat the spaghetti before I take a long shower, going through the usual prep work with diligence and a significant hard-on already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I dawdle a bit I miss Bella\u0027s return, finding Jazz blocking the door when I want to go downstairs to greet her, still dripping from the shower and wearing only a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, dude, but the missus needs time to get ready herself. Until she gives us a sign, we\u0027re supposed to stay in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huff, but then turn around to head back into the bathroom, only to stop halfway there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t even had a chance to talk about the scene with her yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks and leans against the door, as if to stress that he won\u0027t let me through if he can help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me when I say that she doesn\u0027t need help. You should have seen her today. She\u0027s been bossy since breakfast, and I don\u0027t think she\u0027d appreciate you trying to wrestle her out of her role, as it were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know why his words rub me the wrong way, but do my best to hide my wave of resentment towards Jazz as I return to the bathroom. It takes me another five minutes of rubbing myself down furiously and brushing my teeth to make sense of my own feelings – I\u0027m jealous. Jealous of all the time he gets to spend with her, to be more precise, and the chance to give her the one thing I can\u0027t always provide – attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027ve spent the last three weeks worrying that Bella might possibly be feeling neglected because now she\u0027s no longer the only one in the world that I care about. The fact that my jealousy is completely unrelated to anything sexual only makes me feel all the more ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying hard to get a grip on myself, I dress and leave the bathroom to Jazz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he\u0027s done I\u0027m once again mostly excited, although I can\u0027t shake off my apprehension at heading completely blind into this, even more so as he seems too smug not to be in on some of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly enough, when my phone beeps with a new text message, spelling out only a simple \"I\u0027m ready,\" I don\u0027t really care anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do this, shall we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz grins at my obvious excitement, then holds me back at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, just so you know, Bella wants us to behave like real brats. You know, the whole spoiled rich kid, easy on the eye womanizer kind of guy neither of us was in college, simply because my parents lacked the money and you had too much decency. Or to use her exact words, \u0027Give me a reason to spank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort, the memory of her lolita schoolgirl act from earlier this year still fresh in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t be that hard to pull off, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the spirit!\" he laughs, then steps away to let me exit the room. The door to the playroom is closed. With a nod at Jazz, I wrench it open to stagger inside while I make up some bullshit story about a supposed conquest of mine from last night. What I really do is drink in the image presented to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe playroom is oddly transformed, although technically the only additions to it are the desk and a chair from downstairs; all the other usual equipment is stored away, leaving the focus on the figure currently residing in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed lips, hair up in a severe bun, glasses, dressed conservatively in a crisp, white blouse and a dark gray pencil skirt; I\u0027ve seldom seen Bella look so hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she doesn\u0027t react to our entry as she pretends to scribble notes on some printed forms. When Jazz lets out a cheesy yet incredibly funny catcall whistle, her head jerks up, annoyance in her gaze as she compresses her lips into a thin line. Even though she already has our attention, she still clears her throat, then addresses us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen, if you would be so kind as to lower your voices. This is a hall of learning and needs to be quiet; please take your ruckus elsewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz and I exchange glances, before he pulls out a badly abused note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to, but this letter states that I have to be here, so I\u0027m sorry to disappoint you. But if you give me your number, I\u0027d be happy to make it up to you later, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella straightens in her chair, pretending to be insulted, but for a moment she breaks role, a smile showing through the severe look she\u0027s aiming for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we\u0027re here because we have to meet with the library admin, some old hag named Ms. Swan? But after we\u0027re done charming her knickers off, I\u0027d love to get into yours, if you know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze flickers from Jazz to me, her brows raised in a silent \u0027Seriously?\u0027, but she does a good job of looking unimpressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re looking for Ms. Swan? So you must be Mr. Cullen and Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitlock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the flesh, every glorious inch of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Bella manages not to react, Jazz starts to laugh at the worst line that I\u0027ve probably uttered in my whole life, but her disapproving stare makes him shut up surprisingly fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then I am sure you will be happy to have found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make a show of exchanging glances with Jazz, then beam my most charming smile at Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Ms. Swan? I should have guessed. With your beauty, you outshine all of the ugly ducklings populating these halls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t even smile, which must be hard considering the bullshit I\u0027m making up, but her utter lack of reaction is even more powerful than any biting comment she could have offered. Instead she pointedly looks at our empty hands, then back up to our faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you forget something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Condoms are in the car, darling, if you need any,\" Jazz unhelpfully supplies, before we grin at each other again as if we really think that is a great pickup line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant your books,\" she clarifies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, what I can do to you they don\u0027t teach in any books,\" I drawl, then actually wink at her. She\u0027s obviously not impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen, please correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but you don\u0027t seem to be taking this matter very seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bunch of stupid books,\" Jazz shrugs. \"So what, my dad gives a couple hundred thousand to the university each year. I think they can buy new ones from that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe purses her lips again, then looks down at her forms before she\u0027s back to glaring at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t about the money, and your name won\u0027t help you in this case, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitlock. If you don\u0027t pay the fines and return the books, I will be forced to file an official complaint with the Dean for deliberate destruction of university property, a copy of which will also be added to your permanent student records. If I remember correctly, you both have been warned that any further offenses will lead to your immediate expulsion, as agreed to by your parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying my best at a sleazy leer, I lean closer, now almost touching the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Ms. Swan, I\u0027m sure we can find another way to compensate you for the loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I almost think she\u0027s breaking role when she smiles, but then I realize it\u0027s a humorless grimace. She slides her fingers over her phone, still holding my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, this is Bella Swan from the library. I need to speak to Dean Thomas. Is he in? Why yes, please connect me. I\u0027ll hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wait!\" Jazz hollers, sounding surprisingly concerned, but Bella only cocks one eyebrow without removing the phone from her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to say something, Mr. Whitlock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do this, please! We didn\u0027t mean it like that, you know? We\u0027ll do anything you want, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks over at me until I nod, then elaborates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like, we\u0027ll mow you lawn, paint your house, take out the trash, wash your car, stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll even help in the library, if that\u0027s what it takes,\" I offer, but I can\u0027t hold my brief snicker back. Bella\u0027s eyes flicker from one of us to the other, but her gaze doesn\u0027t lose its hostile, predatory quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, anything!\" we both echo, making her purse her lips yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping up the game, she pretends that her call finally went through, her voice going from hard to buttery soft as she tells the \"dean\" that she has finished updating the lists and found everything in order. I allow myself a pretend contended exhale, but before I can do more than that, Bella ends the call and fixes us both with a somewhat hungry glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to be sure, I will keep these forms until I consider your debt repaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry, boys, I\u0027m sure you\u0027re going to enjoy this just as much as I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe then gets up for the first time and walks around her chair to the supply cabinet. I\u0027m surprised for real when she gets a small handheld camcorder from inside, and after fiddling with the controls, puts it up on one of the side boards. The recorder is focused on the center of her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my own amusement later. I hope you don\u0027t mind,\" she drawls, then puts her hands on her hips and regards us both with a calculating look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz and I exchange glances, and I can tell that whatever advantage his advance knowledge has given him is now gone. I give a hint of a shrug, then a slight nod at him to go on, letting him take the lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t respond at all before when we offered to fuck you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grin is devious, and I feel a little like shying away from her when she comes stalking towards us, her high heels clicking loudly on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because I still don\u0027t want to get fucked by either of you. You said you\u0027d do anything, and yet you balk at the simplest of things. I\u0027m sure the Dean is still in his office; one phone call from me and this whole situation resolves itself. Do you want that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, and even manages to look somewhat chagrined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Then be good little boys and do what I say now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella turns away and walks back to the door, shutting it with an ominous sound before she returns to her desk. She seems a little more relaxed now as she sits with one leg crossed over her knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m waiting. Don\u0027t make me tell you again or the deal\u0027s off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited as I am, I decide not to make a fuss, but Jazz is a lot slower than me to unbutton his shirt and kick off his shoes. I\u0027m already completely naked, my hands folded over my genitals in a pretend attempt at modesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella keeps watching us with a serenity that I never thought her capable of, as if she couldn\u0027t care less about having two naked men standing in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Jazz is completely naked, too, she allows herself a tight-lipped smile as she scrutinizes us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, don\u0027t be so shy. Let me see what you\u0027re so proud of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling my mind already slipping into a more obedient state, I drop my hands to my sides, but Jazz is once again reluctant. From the way his whole body vibrates with tension, I\u0027m not even sure it\u0027s only an act. I have to admit, it\u0027s funny to realize that he has almost no problem submitting to me, but Bella, in full-on Domme mode, makes his hackles rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella seems to come to the same conclusion as she gets up and walks around us once, stopping behind Jasper. She grabs his arms and pulls them to his sides, needing to use some force. In turn, she snorts when she steps to the side and glances at our cocks – mine is already screaming for attention, while Jazz isn\u0027t even semi-erect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she does next also comes as a surprise, and again a mixed pleasure as far as Jazz is concerned – she slaps us both in the face, Jazz only lightly, but me hard enough to make me blink with pain for a second. He grunts and automatically steps away from her while I try not to move a muscle, earning an amused snort from her as she gently strokes my cheek where she has just slapped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you a good little slut? I like that at least one of you has the good sense to behave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth her tone and the way she pats my cheek are condescending as hell, causing an unexpectedly deep blush of humiliation to spread over my cheeks, but I\u0027m certainly not going to complain. Jazz looks less happy but she obviously enjoys his resistance just as much as my compliance. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-51.html","bookId":2786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:01 PM"}
