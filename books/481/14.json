{"id":36921,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV EXTRA!","content":"From the New York Courier, July 27th, 192—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At 3.40 this afternoon Ernest Riever was found dead in a house he occasionally occupied at — East 39th street, this city. He had shot himself through the head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sensational developments in the Counsell case during the past two days were brought to a still more sensational conclusion this afternoon when Ernest Riever was discovered to have killed himself. Ever since yesterday morning it has been an open secret around town that Riever was the unnamed millionaire so often referred to in the new evidence brought forward in Counsell\u0027s defense. It now appears that Riever has been under the surveillance of the police for three days, and this afternoon detective officers were sent to the above address to arrest him. Their ringing at the door elicited no response, and as the men who had been detailed to trail Riever insisted that he was in the house, an entrance was forced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Riever was discovered lying in his dining-room with an automatic pistol in his hand. There was nobody else in the house. He had held the pistol under his chin pointing upward. There was smoke in the room, and the body was warm, indicating that the deed was done as the officers rang the bell. Death was instantaneous. So ends one of the strangest stories that has ever come to light in our courts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Riever\u0027s self-inflicted death renders the acquittal of Counsell merely a matter of form. It is said that the District-Attorney will now make no effort to refute the testimony tending to show that Collis Dongan was shot by an agent acting under Riever\u0027s instructions. The jury is expected to bring in a verdict without leaving their seats.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2143/60610.html","bookId":481,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:32:16 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:32:16 AM"}
