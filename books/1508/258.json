He came from an ordinary family and lived an ordinary life.

They had already been briefed on all of Lin Ming’s information. For a 16 year old to have such a performance in the Total Faction Martial Meeting was rare even in the last 200 years!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, the sun hadn’t risen. Dawn was just around the corner, and yet there were already crowds of people gathered on the square of the Seven Profound Valleys’ Grand Hall.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe various elders of the small sects in the Seven Profound territory, the 16 group leaders of the martial cultivation families, the various Martial House Masters and nobles of the 36 countries, and other great characters were gathered in the square. Any of these characters would be grand figures if placed within a small country; their existence itself would earn the admiration of millions. But here, these people weren’t even allowed to sit in the front row, much less go into the Grand Hall.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This year’s Total Faction Martial Meeting should have the most skilled disciples in nearly the last three centuries!” In the audience, Huoluo Nation’s Martial House Master Luo was sipping some tea. As the Martial House Master of a large country, he had been given preferential treatment. He had a table by his side, some tea to drink, and also some dried fruits to nibble on.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, definitely. Didn’t Divine Phoenix Island send out a messenger? They really are giving face to our Seven Profound Valleys.

The referee of the final tournament was already standing in the center of the martial stage. This person had a cultivation at the middle Xiantian realm, and was also one of the Inner Court elders of the Seven Profound Valleys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I won’t repeat the rules of the competition – they are the same as the group stage qualifiers. There are altogether 30 people in the first tier finals. Everyone will have at least 29 matches. Those with the least points at the end will face a challenge from those in the second tier with the most points. This means that you may or may not still be in the top 30 ranks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Now, let the finals begin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe elder referee’s voice was very loud and clear; the entire mountain valley resounded with his voice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, do your best and try hard to enter the top 10. If you’re up against an opponent you cannot defeat, don’t try to be brave and get yourself hurt.” Qin Ziya repeatedly advised Lin Ming as they headed to the contestant waiting area. Although it was against the rules to kill or disable your opponent, if the strength of the two contestants were similar, then they would have to fight the battle with everything they had. In such a situation it would be very difficult to control one’s strength, and it wasn’t uncommon to be severely injured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I understand.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming moved towards the contestant waiting area and sat patiently in a chair. The first match soon began. A core disciple and a non-seeded player walked on stage. Although this was a fierce competition between two individuals, the audience seemed to be a bit disappointed, they most wanted to watch a match between the direct disciples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the battle on the stage was intensely unfolding, Lin Ming saw an extremely handsome and good looking man walking over to him. This stylish and suave looking man was holding a fan, and had a hint of a disdainful sneer on his face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming furrowed his eyebrows, he didn’t recognize this person.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Are you Lin Ming?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I am Ouyang Zifeng, a core disciple of the Seven Profound Valleys’ Acacia Faction.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t think I know you?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“…It doesn’t matter whether or not you know me, it’s enough that I know you.

He had been dining with Qin Xingxuan when a fight had broken out. In the end, he had used his Samsara martial intent to injure an Acacia Faction disciple whose last name was also Ouyang. So it seems he was this person’s younger brother.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, at that time Lin Ming had actually gone very easy on him. The reason that Ouyang Ziyun had been injured so heavily was because he wasn’t able to control his own ability – the Purple Flame Bone Lance. After his ability was broken, the true essence that he had gathered caused a backlash which resulted in him being injured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFeeling Ouyang Zifeng’s reckless and sharp hostility, Lin Ming coldly said, “The reason that your little brother was injured so miserably was because he tried to use an ability he couldn’t control and got struck by his own backlash. It has nothing to do with me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Nothing to do with you? Humph, if it wasn’t for you attacking him, how could my little brother lose control of his Purple Flame Bone Lance!!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Then what you are saying is that I should extend my neck out and let your little brother attack me however he wants? What if I wasn’t strong enough and couldn’t deal with the Purple Flame Bone Lance? Wouldn’t I be burned to ashes? In Desert Flower Hall, I didn’t even bother him or provoke him, and yet he had to use the Purple Flame Bone Lance which he could not control in order to kill me. If he really killed me, then the most severe punishment would be getting grounded for a month or two. But if I killed him, then I must pay with my life. How arrogant and domineering must you Seven Profound Valleys disciples be!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Zifeng laughed viciously and said, “This world has only been decided by strength! Those who are strong make the rules! I am stronger than you, thus I make the rules!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You think you are stronger than me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You’ll find out soon enough. Our match is the fourth, it will soon start!” Ouyang Zifeng said as he turned and strode away. He had already looked at the competition schedule ahead of time, and knew that he would encounter Lin Ming in the first round.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the time that Ouyang Zifeng left, the match onstage had already come to a conclusion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Second match, Zhang Yanzhao against Yan Yandong!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the referee’s voice fell, the audience members that came from the 16 martial cultivation families let loose ringing cheers. Zhang Yanzhao was the final representative of all 16 martial families. During this Total Faction Martial Meeting, he had already reached the top 20; he had great chances of reaching the top 10!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis opponent Yan Yandong had already lost two matches in the second group stage.

Yan Yandong pulled out a small array flag. As he waved it, a hundred golden symbols flew into the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Demon Locking Array!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe golden symbols flew towards Zhang Yanzhao like a locust swarm.

The surrounding true essence in the air stirred together like a raging storm of destruction, and those golden symbols that flew in the air were like snowflakes that fell into a furnace – they instantly melted away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first saber strike destroyed Yan Yandong’s array, and the second saber strike broke apart Yan Yandong’s bodily true essence protection. The aftermath from that strike was already enough to angrily send Yan Yandong flying backwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYan Yandong’s bodily true essence protection had been cleanly broken apart, but he himself wasn’t injured at all. Obviously, the degree of strength control that Zhang Yanzhao possessed was extremely formidable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe different in their strength was just too great.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Zhang Yanzhao is truly fierce!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I think that our 16 martial families’ Zhang Yanzhao isn’t any worse than the direct disciples of the Seven Factions!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ones who were speaking were the disciples of the 16 martial families. As they spoke up, a Seven Profound Valleys disciple that was sitting at their side contemptuously smiled and said, “That’s only because you haven’t experienced the strength of the direct disciples for yourself. If Zhang Yanzhao met Ouyang Ming or even Jiang Baoyun, then he would be defeated in five moves.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Five moves?

But, in the opinion of the general audience, Lin Ming may be a genius, but the difference between him and one of the seven direct disciples was simply too great. During the qualifying stages, Lin Ming had defeated Jing Chanyu in two moves. However, this didn’t really raise anyone’s opinion of him. After all, Jing Chanyu didn’t have much chances of ending up in the top 20. Thus, defeating Jing Chanyu didn’t mean much.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, the upper echelon of the Seven Profound Valleys was watching this match with rapt attention, eyes glued to the stage. They were especially looking forward to seeing Lin Ming in action. This Lin Ming was just too young!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn particular, the Seven Profound Valleys Valley Master Shi Zongtian had already ordered an investigation into Lin Ming’s entire last three generations of family. After receiving the report back, Shi Zongtian was simply startled out of his mind. Lin Ming had actually come from an extremely ordinary background, and he was a typical common martial artist. It was simply inconceivable that he could have such amazing results!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Ouyang Zifeng walked onstage, many disciples began to immediately cheer, especially those female disciples who didn’t have much talent for martial arts, they screamed until their voices were hoarse and could scream no longer. Because of their limited martial talent, they always vainly dreamed of marrying a core disciple. However, the core disciples of the Sword Faction and Refiner Faction pursued their martial arts path wholeheartedly, and most simply weren’t lured by the pleasures of the flesh. There was just no chance of these girls being able to attract one of them. Thus the disciples of the Acacia Faction were the most sought after.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCompared to Ouyang Zifeng, there were far less cheers for Lin Ming. There just weren’t that many disciples of the 36 countries present.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Zifeng and Lin Ming stood 100 feet apart from each other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Zifeng sneered and said, “I heard that you can control the power of thunder. I advise you not to try and hide any cards in your hand, and to use whatever moves you have when you can. Otherwise, you won’t have the opportunity to.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I never intended to hide any cards.

The sword was inserted into a scabbard that was made from snake skin. It looked simple, but it exuded a very light true essence fluctuation. Obviously, this scabbard was some sort of extraordinary treasure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming faintly smiled. Force you to draw your sword?

He was trying to come to a deeper understanding of his Samsara martial intent. Even if he didn’t expect his Samsara martial intent to defeat his opponent, he would still use it in order to gain some more insights into his martial intent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Zifeng had already expected that Lin Ming would use a soul attack. With a sneer, the scabbard in his hand began to fiercely tremble, and the sound of a wailing ghost cry began to emit outwards. A massive number of green ghosts suddenly emerged from the sword blade and circled around Ouyang Zifeng. These ghosts seemed to be formed of a chilling air, as if they were enough to freeze a person’s soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming’s soul attack struck, it was completely blocked by these ghosts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng peng peng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs a ghost was stuck by the soul attack, it would inflate like a balloon and then burst apart. But as this ghost died, a new one would emerge to take its place. Lin Ming had killed over a dozen ghosts with his first attack, but he still hadn’t been able to harm Ouyang Zifeng.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Humph! Although the power of my soul force is inferior to yours, your soul attacks are useless against me! These ghosts are condensed from the Yin Qi that I’ve refined within my body. Every time you disperse one, they will just re-enter my body.

This flame sprang dozens of feet high, and soon Ouyang Zifeng was completely enveloped within it. What was strange was that this purple flame wasn’t burning hot. Instead, it exuded a bone chilling energy. The tiles underneath Ouyang Zifeng’s feet began to ice over, spreading out with him at the center.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Purple Flame Bone Lance…” Lin Ming easily recognized this ability.

From it, the sounds of wailing ghosts and tormented spirits echoed out. With Ouyang Zifeng’s cultivation, he was able to display the true abilities of the Purple Flame Bone Lance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuuu–!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe bone lance shot out, quick as lightning! Blurred flames followed in its path, creating the afterimage of a trailing tail of burning purple fire! A loud explosive sound pierced the air mixed with the weeping sounds of ghosts, scratching upon the eardrums of those nearby.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSou-!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was directly pierced by the bone lance!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe audience didn’t even have time to respond.

Qin Ziya was even more nervous, both of his hands were clenched together until they were white.
