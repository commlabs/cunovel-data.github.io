Just great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox saw my sideboob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flush. At least he didn’t see nipple. Just pasty-white side-boob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide-boob won’t affect anything. What do I care? I’ve seen his bare ass. His mighty fine bare ass. I wonder what it would feel like. It looks like you could bounce a quarter off it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my mind wanders, Nox opens the door and asks, “Want a shower before breakfast?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to get out of this confined space as quickly as possible, I spray myself with his deodorant before throwing it to him. He sprays himself and throws it back. I respond with, “Nah. Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping on my now clean workout pants, Nox stops me with the stink eye and an, “Uh, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head, he looks down at my ensemble through furrowed brows. “You’re not going out like that, Lily. Put somethin’ else on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not quite sure what the problem is here. “What’s wrong with what I’ve got on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking up to me, he pinches the bottom of the tank between his forefinger and thumb and announces, “This is not appropriate for down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa! I know what this is about now. I chuckle while shaking my head slowly, “Is this because of this morning’s side-boob?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turns confused. “Side- side-” Lifting his hands to his head, he rubs his temples slowly as if he’s getting a headache and mutters, “I’m not sure I wanna know, but what the fuck is side-boob?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling my eyes, I respond, “So you saw the side of my boob. It’s all good. I’ve seen you’re your ass, so we’re even. C’mon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking toward the door, Nox says firmly, “I’m serious, Lily. You’re not goin’ out like that. It’s just askin’ for trouble. Put on a damn bra.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knew Nox was a prude?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot back, “I don’t have a damn bra! If you remember, I didn’t exactly pack for this trip!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisibly calming himself, he breathes deeply and replies on an exhale, “Fine. That’s fine. Then you’ll just have to wear another tee or somethin’, because I can see- see- your- uh- side-boob.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScore one: Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling angelically, I take the tee from his outstretched hand. My fingers brush his and I ask sweetly, “Why didn’t you just say so then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain claps and pulls an impressed face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I just flirt with Nox?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother big breakfast this morning goes down well. This time, I order the tomato and cheese omelet and it’s moist and fluffy. Just heavenly. Chasing that with Nox’s pancakes once again, and a glass of OJ, I watch while he orders yet another platter of sandwiches and flirts with the sweet waitress from the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy doesn’t he flirt with me like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the urge to pout and let him drag me along. My belly’s getting the better of me again, half way there, he has to piggyback me. He says, “Maybe I should just buy you a wheelchair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but laugh and laugh right in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that food, mixed with copious amounts of horny, equals drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to now. Third day in our little love shack. Minus the love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m secretly looking forward to going to bed tonight, just so I can feel those arms around me again. My mood has improved three-hundred percent. Nox’s by about thirty-seven percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a fact. Don’t question my calculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little joking over breakfast has set the speed for the day, and my heart skips a beat when I see him grabbing things from around the place. He puts some bills in his pocket and says, “Don’t go anywhere. Be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut... but… what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” I don’t even try to mask my fallen face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Out. Be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m suddenly fuming. “And what, Nox? I’m just meant to play the willing captive while you’re gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion mars his face and he mutters, “What the f-” Shaking his head, he places a hand on his hip and utters, “Let me put this in a way you’ll understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting on his best bimbo, he bounces on his heel and says, “Like, tryna keep you safe here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my lip to stop myself from laughing, his eyes darken as he strides over to me, trapping me between the door and his chest. He mutters, “Maybe you want that. Maybe you like the idea of being a captive. Being helpless.” Leaning forward, the tip of his nose brushes my earlobe and he whispers, “Does that turn you on, princess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure what’s happening here. My hormones have gone haywire and my brain is drooling again. I manage to whisper back, “Now you’re just being a jerk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body turns rock solid before he sighs, reaches for the handle, and leaves me in our honeymoon suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone and lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsence makes the heart grow fonder\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days have passed and I’m back in the safe house slash safe mansion slash pentagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long after our close and extremely awkward encounter, Nox came back into our room and advised me to pack my shit. I told him I had no shit to pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe responded with, “Great. Then you’re ready to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked, “Go where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding my eyes, he replied softly, “Home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd somehow, I just knew he meant my home away from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn saying that, nine hours later, we were back. And it’s good to be home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it weird that I feel like this is home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I don’t think so. Not when we arrived back and Boo ran over to me, hugging the life out of me for a solid minute, stroking my hair like long lost sisters being reunited. Not when a seriously relieved looking Rock picked me up and swung me around, telling me, “Great to have you back, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox spoke to them both for a moment in whispers and riddles, and I knew better to ask about what happened the day the alarms went off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later and completely Nox free. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a feeling he’s avoiding me. Again. But I’ve been spending most of my time with Boo, and that makes me happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you bitc- Motherfu- Shitballs!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo chuckles, “Oh relax. It isn’t that bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoff, “Yeah, right, you freakin’ harlot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo laughs. I cringe and whimper, “Oh God. You’re actually enjoying this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she stops, she asks, “Your sister never tried this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFisting the sheets, I reply through gritted teeth, “Oh, she tried. I karate chopped her ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says, “I don’t get it.” I open my eyes to find her looking down at me, “The whole you don’t have friends thing. You’re pretty cool, Deedee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath and closing my eyes, I explain, “Well, Dad was always overprotective. Then it got worse. We weren’t allowed to go anywhere without him or Mom. I never really understood it.” Till now, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, what’s the worst that could happen from me going to a sleepover?” I sigh, “Eventually, the little friends I had stopped asking me to come over and drifted away from me. My sister was always there for me, though. She had this way about her. I guess she still does. She’s always been popular, so no one questioned why she wasn’t coming out to parties and stuff. She’d just pass it off with ‘I’ve got a better offer’ or ‘Nah, it’s not really my thing’. Well, Terah got sick of Dad’s rules and started sneaking out and I- I didn’t. I’d stay at home with my book boyfriends and that was fine by me. Ow! Stop that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlucking another stray hair, she pulls back and says, “Done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, I walk over to the mirror and check my newly shaped eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot bad. Not bad at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at her through the mirror and state, “So much pain for this? It doesn’t even look like you plucked anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying back on the bed, she says, “Oh, it’s noticeable, alright. You’re lucky. You’ve been blessed with a great shape. You should see mine when I don’t pluck.” She lifts her head and looks at my reflection in the mirror. “Scary. I’d have a unibrow in the shape of the McDonald’s m.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning around, I lean back on the dresser and ask, “Why do you even bother? You work with men, and I’m sure they don’t care that you pluck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles slyly and bats her lashes, “Oh, but my man would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEeek! Her man! Swoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBouncing over to the bed wearing an annoyingly cheeky smile, I ask in a sing-song voice, “Oh, yeah? Who is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer shocks me so much my mouth gapes. “Rock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, I whisper-hiss, “No way!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, she replies, “Way, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth hangs open and she laughs. I sputter, “B- b- but you guys act like you don’t even like each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, she smiles sadly, “Technically, we aren’t allowed to see each other. It’s...” She actually lifts her hands and does slow quotation mark actions with her fingers, “…fraternizing. Nox knows, but he said he can’t really do anything about it unless it affects our work, which I would never let happen anyways. And what with Rock and Nox being best friends, I think Nox is actually happy to see that Rock’s got something good in this life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused by that last statement, I ask quietly, “What do you mean in this life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo searches my face a while. She looks unsure before answering me quietly, “Babe, we don’t exist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused even more now, my brow furrows as I ask, “Come again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lies back down with her arms resting behind her head. Looking up at the ceiling, she explains, “This thing - what we do - protection and elimination. We don’t work for anyone. We work for ourselves. I guess you could call it a made-up business. We all have titles within our sector, but the sector doesn’t actually exist. We’re all privately employed and we get paid a lot to do what we do. The condition of being employed this way is to be unseen, and our circle to be impenetrable. So everyone you’ve met here, they don’t have any form of real identification. Every document, ID card, and bank account we have is under a false name.” Turning her head to face me, she finishes with, “We don’t exist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit, that’s insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring right back at her, I surmise, “So everyone I’ve met here is going under a fake name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and I ask, “What happened to who you were? You know, who you used to be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling a sad smile, she responds quietly, “She died, babe. We all did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart squeezes as I whisper, “Well, that sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo turns to her side and we look at each other for a moment. We’re having a silent conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth droops and I frown slightly. I’m sorry, boo. That really does suck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs slightly and winks. It’s okay. I’m okay with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaying with my fingertips, I blurt out, “Constance? You chose the name Constance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bursts into laughter and I do, too. We laugh together a short while before her face softens and she replies quietly, “It was my mom’s name. My way of never forgetting her. She was a Connie so it never felt right calling myself that. One day, Rock told me I was quiet as a ghost so he nicknamed me Boo, and I’ve been Boo ever since.” Suddenly sobering, she asks, “Do you have a boyfriend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I tell her, “Not unless he’s the fictional kind. It’s just me and my books.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turns thoughtful, her eyes sad. She murmurs, “Must get lonely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, I say just as quietly, “I could say the same for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles back. “Touché.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both lay back down on the bed with a sigh. I guess my life isn’t so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I’m not dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcusing myself to get something to eat for me and Boo, I run into the kitchen and my sock-covered feet, and slide to a stop only an inch away from Nox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes flash. “Where you goin’ so quick, princess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday is one of the rare days he doesn’t have on a shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes strain as I beg them to remain fixed on his face and not his broad and solid chest, which is deliciously damp with perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just getting something to eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, he says genuinely, “Glad your appetite’s back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding in return, I respond sincerely, “Me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwkward silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loooong awkward silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving around him to the pantry, my brain reminds me that we have something to discuss with him. Just as he moves to leave the huge kitchen, which suddenly feels about as big as a mailbox, I call out, “Actually, I’ve been meaning to ask if you spoke to Mitch about me talking to my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace void of emotion, he leans his hip on the counter. “No. Not yet.” Reaching over the counter, he picks up an apple and plays with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a little pissed at this. He said he would try. My face turns to steel. I walk around the kitchen slamming the pantry shut, and open and close the drawers far too quickly, wanting the noise to convey my mood right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox sees right through me. “Why’re you pissed, now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBombs away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosing my patience, I shout, “Know what would make me happy, Nox? Knowing my sister is okay! I like Boo, no, I love Boo, but she isn’t my sister, and you think I don’t know what you’re doing, and that makes you so much more of a dick! Know what would make me better than happy? Actually speaking to her and hearing for myself that she’s alive and well. Not shoving a substitute under my nose.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/willing-captive/page-12.html","bookId":2800,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM"}
