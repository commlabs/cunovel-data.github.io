My poor darling. Have you been denied any other husbandly rights?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t deny yourself.” Alistair caught her by the elbows and tugged her to her feet. There was a roughness and urgency to his touch that belied the softness of the melody with which he’d mesmerized her. Her nipples beaded tight beneath her bodice in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew, of course. His hands cupped her swelling breasts and kneaded with slightly more pressure than necessary. The edge to him made her hot and wet, eager. She loved all the ways he made love to her, but the times he sought her out while at the end of his control were special. She no longer had to drive him to the precipice. He stood on the cliff and called for her, deliberately bringing her close at the times when he was capable of being most vulnerable. Then, they would make the fall together, as they did everything together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her hands on his hips, tugging herself closer. “I’m too self-indulgent when it comes to you,” she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indulge yourself with me on a honeymoon,” he coaxed in that dark voice of sin. “Weeks on a ship. Months in Jamaica. We have unfinished business there, you and I. Hester is strong enough now to bear the loss of you for a time, and Michael will look after her with as much care as he would look after his own heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you go now? Can you afford the time away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve spoken with Masterson. Now is the time to go, while he is fit and able.” His hands slid up to her face, cupping her cheeks. Tilting his head, he brought his lips to hers, kissing her softly. “I want to swim with you naked. I want to show you the fields burning. I want to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—fuck in the rain,” she whispered, just to feel the tension grip him. “There is no need to seduce me to elicit my acquiescence. I would go with you anywhere, for any reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But this way is much more enjoyable.” Bending his knees, he matched his thick erection to the juncture of her thighs and rolled his hips against her. “With the windows open and our guests outside, you will have to be quiet in your pleasures.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While you do your worst to make me scream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth curved against his lips. “Perhaps you will be the noisy one. Perhaps I will make you groan and curse and beg for mercy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that a challenge, Lady Baybury?” he purred. “You know I cannot resist a challenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess reached behind him and gripped his taut, delicious buttocks. “I know. In fact, I am counting on that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcheron, well versed in the proclivities of his lord and mistress, padded out of the room and found his mat beside the chaise in the adjoining sitting room. Flopping to his side, he fell into a blissful canine slumber, lulled by the sweet sounds of laughter and love that spilled from the bedroom behind him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-years-to-sin-historical-1/page-38.html","bookId":2663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM"}
