The next he\u0027s a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, as he soon learns, is a backwater, just a \"pebble in the sky\", despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it\u0027s the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soilâ€”so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty to conserve resources. Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two. This is the young Isaac Asimov\u0027s first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation series. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:49 AM"}
