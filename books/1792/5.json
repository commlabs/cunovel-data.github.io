An odd reaction, to my way of thinking, when you consider how much thieving her husband does at the gambling tables. The man\u0027s a flagrant cheat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand Jack only robbed the Wellinghams. Is it true he left the guests alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone nodded. \"Yes. The man obviously was in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems to me he\u0027s aching to get caught,\" Lyon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t agree,\" Rhone answered. \"Thus far, he\u0027s only stolen from those who I think needed a good set down. I actually admire the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lyon gave him a puzzling look, Rhone hastened to change the topic. \"The ladies would approach us if you\u0027d smile. Then you might begin to enjoy yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve finally lost your mind. How can you pretend to enjoy this farce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are those who think you\u0027ve lost your mind, Lyon. It\u0027s a fact you\u0027ve been secluded from the ton too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s a fact you\u0027ve endured one too many seasons,\" Lyon answered. \"Your mind has turned to mush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense. My mind turned to mush years ago when we drank sour gin in school together. I really do enjoy myself, though. You would, too, if you\u0027d only remember this is all just a game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t play games,\" Lyon said. \"And war is a better description for this scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone laughed, loud enough to draw curious stares. \"Tell me this, friend. Are we pitted against the ladies, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is their quest? What do they hope to gain if they conquer us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" Rhone replied, dragging out the sound. \"I suppose they use their bodies as their weapons. Is it their battle plan to make us so glazed with lust we\u0027ll offer anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all they have to offer,\" Lyon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord, you are as jaded as everyone says. I worry that your attitude will rub off on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone shuddered as he spoke, but the effect was ruined by his grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t appear to be too concerned,\" Lyon remarked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These ladies are only after marriage, not our lives,\" Rhone said. \"You don\u0027t have to play the game if you don\u0027t want to. Besides, I\u0027m only an insignificant earl. You, on the other hand, must certainly marry again if the line is to continue forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well I\u0027m never going to marry again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon answered. His voice had turned as hard as the marble he was leaning against. \"Drop this subject, Rhone. I\u0027ve no sense of humor when it comes to the issue of marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve no sense of humor at all,\" Rhone pronounced in such a cheerful tone of voice Lyon couldn\u0027t help but grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone was about to continue his list of Lyon\u0027s other faults when a rather attractive redheaded lady happened to catch his concentration. He gave her his full attention until he spotted Lyon\u0027s little sister making her way over to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better get rid of your frown,\" Rhone advised. \"Diana\u0027s coming over. Lord, she just elbowed the Countess Seringham.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon sighed, then forced a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Diana came to an abrupt stop in front of her brother, her short-cropped brown curls continued to float around her cherublike face. Her brown eyes sparkled with excitement. \"Oh, Lyon, I\u0027m so happy to see you smiling. Why, I do believe you\u0027re enjoying yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t wait for her brother to reply to her observation but turned to curtsy in front of Rhone. \"It\u0027s so good to see you again,\" she said, sounding quite breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone inclined his head in greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it remarkable I was able to plead Lyon into coming this evening? He really doesn\u0027t like parties very much, Rhone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t?\" Rhone asked, sounding so disbelieving Lyon actually laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t jest with her,\" Lyon said. \"Are you enjoying yourself, Diana?\" he asked his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Diana answered. \"Mama will be pleased. I do hope she\u0027s still awake when we get home so I can tell her all about tonight. I\u0027ve just learned Princess Christina will be making an appearance, too. I confess I\u0027m most curious to meet her. Why, I\u0027ve heard the most wonderful stories about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Princess Christina?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Rhone who hastened to answer his question. \"You\u0027ve been secluded too long, Lyon, or you surely would have heard of her. Though I haven\u0027t actually met the lady, I\u0027ve been told she\u0027s very beautiful. There\u0027s an air of mystery surrounding her, too. Her father was ruler of some little principality near Austria\u0027s border. He was unseated during a rather nasty revolution,\" Rhone continued. \"Lady Christina, if we use the title she gained from her mother, has traveled all over the world. Brummel met her and was immediately infatuated. He was the first to call her Princess. The woman neither accepted nor rejected that title.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to her mother?\" Diana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked quite spellbound by the story about the princess. Rhone smiled at her eagerness. \"A tragedy, I\u0027m told. The mother was weakheaded, and she—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by weakheaded?\" Diana interrupted to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Insane,\" Rhone explained. \"When the mother learned she was going to have a child, she ran off. Until three months ago, everyone believed both mother and babe were dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to Princess Christina\u0027s father?\" Diana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left England shortly after his wife disappeared. No one has heard of him since. Probably dead by now,\" Rhone ended with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the poor Princess,\" Diana whispered. \"Does she have anyone to call family now, or is she all alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Diana, you don\u0027t even know the woman and you look ready to weep for her,\" Lyon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is such a sad story,\" Diana said, defending herself. She turned back to Rhone and added, \"I remember how unbearable it was for all of us when James died. Mother still hasn\u0027t recovered. She stays hidden in her room pretending all sorts of ills, when it\u0027s truly grief that keeps her there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone took one look at Lyon\u0027s cold expression and immediately hastened to turn the topic around. \"Yes, well, we all miss James,\" he lied, his tone brisk. \"I\u0027m anxious to meet Princess Christina, too, Diana. No one has been able to glean a scrap of information about her past. That does make for a mystery to be solved, now doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rhone gave Diana a wink, she blushed. Lyon\u0027s sister was still such an innocent. She was fetching enough, too, now that Rhone paused to really take a good look at her. Diana had filled out nicely since he\u0027d last seen her. That realization actually irritated Rhone, though for the life of him he couldn\u0027t understand why. \"Brat,\" he suddenly blurted out, \"you do look pretty tonight.\" Rhone grimaced over the roughness he\u0027d heard in his own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana didn\u0027t seem to notice. She smiled over his compliment, affected another curtsy, and said, \"Thank you, Rhone. It is kind of you to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone frowned at Lyon. \"Her gown is cut entirely too low. What could you have been thinking of to allow her in public this way? You\u0027d better keep a close eye on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I keep my eye on you, Diana will be safe enough,\" Lyon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same, I really think…\" The sentence trailed off, for Rhone had just glanced toward the entrance of the salon. He let out a low whistle. Diana quickly turned around to see what held Rhone so enthralled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princess Christina.\" Diana whispered the obvious, her voice filled with awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon was the last to react. When he saw the vision standing across the room, he literally jerked away from the mantel. His body instinctively assumed a battle stance, his muscles tensed, ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was slow to regain control. He realized his hands were actually fisted at his sides and his legs were braced apart for a fight, and he forced himself to relax. The abrupt movement made his knee start throbbing again. Lyon couldn\u0027t do anything about the pain now, or the furious pounding in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no matter how valiantly he tried, he couldn\u0027t seem to take his gaze away from the Princess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really was lovely. She was dressed in silver from head to toe. The color belonged to an angel and highlighted the paler threads of her blond hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a doubt, she was the most beautiful woman he\u0027d ever seen. Her skin appeared to be flawless, and even from the distance separating them Lyon could see the color of her eyes. They were the most startling shade of blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincess Christina neither smiled nor frowned. Her expression showed only mild curiosity. The woman obviously understood her own appeal, Lyon concluded, hoping his cynical nature would save him from heart failure. He wasn\u0027t at all pleased about the way his body continued to respond to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brummel was right,\" Rhone announced. \"The lady is enchanting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I do hope I\u0027ll be able to meet her,\" Diana said. She whispered as though they were in church. \"Just look at everyone, Rhone. They are all taken with her. Do you think the Princess will be agreeable to an introduction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, Diana,\" Rhone said. \"Princess Christina wouldn\u0027t dare ignore you. You seem to forget just who your brother is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana gave Rhone a timid nod. \"Sweetling, straighten your shoulders and quit wringing your hands. You\u0027ll give yourself spots. We\u0027ll find someone to give us a proper introduction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone knew Lyon\u0027s little sister hadn\u0027t heard the last of his remarks. She\u0027d already picked up her skirts and headed for the entrance. \"Now what do we do?\" he asked when Lyon grabbed hold of his arm to stop him from chasing after Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wait and see,\" Lyon advised. His voice sounded with irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sister is too impetuous,\" Rhone muttered, shaking his head. \"She\u0027s ignoring all her lessons in—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s high time Diana learned the lesson of discretion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us hope it isn\u0027t too painful for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon didn\u0027t remark on that hope. He continued to give his attention to the beautiful Princess. An elderly couple approached the woman just as Diana came barreling to a halt a bare inch or so in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana almost knocked Christina to her knees. Rhone let out a long groan. The elderly couple didn\u0027t even try to hide their displeasure when they were so rudely cut off. Both turned away, staring at each other in obvious embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, Diana just cut in front of the Duke and Duchess,\" Rhone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon was infuriated with his sister. He was about to go after her to save her from further humiliation when the Princess took matters into her own hands. Rather nicely, too. She greeted Lyon\u0027s sister with what appeared to be a sincere smile, then took hold of Diana\u0027s hands when she spoke to her. Lyon thought the Princess was deliberately giving the impression to all those watching that she and Diana were close friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the way Christina motioned Diana over to her side so that both could greet the Duke and Duchess of Devenwood. The Princess included Diana in the brief conversation, too, effectively smoothing over the mistake his sister had made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone sighed with relief. \"Well, what do you know? She\u0027s still holding Diana\u0027s hand, too. A clever ploy to keep Diana from accidentally belting her one, I would imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon rested his shoulder against the mantel again, smiling over Rhone\u0027s observation. \"Diana does like to use her hands when she speaks,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Princess has a good heart. God\u0027s truth, I believe I\u0027m in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re always in love,\" Lyon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t able to keep the irritation out of his voice. Odd, but for some reason Rhone\u0027s jest bothered him. He didn\u0027t particularly want Princess Christina added to Rhone\u0027s list of future conquests. It was a ridiculous notion, Lyon realized. Why did he care if his friend chased after the woman or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed when he realized he didn\u0027t have a ready answer. He did care, however. Fiercely so. And that honest admission soured Lyon\u0027s mood all the more. Damn, he was too old and too tired for an infatuation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina didn\u0027t have any idea of the stir she was causing. She patiently waited in the center of the doorway for her Aunt Patricia to finish her conversation with their host. An eager young lady stood beside her, chattering away at such an incredible pace Christina couldn\u0027t quite keep up with her. She pretended interest, smiled when it seemed appropriate, and nodded whenever the lady named Diana paused for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Diana announced she was going to fetch her friends for an introduction. Christina was left alone again. She turned to look at all the people openly gawking at her, a serene smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t think she was ever going to get used to them. The English were such a peculiar lot. Though she\u0027d been living in London for almost three months now, she was still perplexed by the odd rituals these whites seemed so determined to endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were just as foolish as their women. They all looked alike, too, dressed as they were in identical black garb. Their white neck wraps were starched to the point of giving the impression they were being strangled to death, an impression strengthened by their red, ruddy cheeks. No, Christina silently amended, they weren\u0027t called neck wraps… cravats, she told herself. Yes, that was the proper name for a neck wrap. She mustn\u0027t forget again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was so much to remember. Christina had studied diligently since arriving on her Aunt Patricia\u0027s doorstep in Boston a year ago. She already spoke French and English. The missionary Black Wolf had captured years before had taught her very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lessons in Boston centered on the behavior expected of a gentle lady. Christina tried to please her aunt, and to ease some of her fears, too. The sour woman was Christina\u0027s only link with her mother\u0027s family. Later, however, when Christina had conquered the written word well enough to understand the meaning in her mother\u0027s diary, her motives had changed. Dramatically. It was now imperative Christina win a temporary place in this bizarre society. She couldn\u0027t make any mistakes until her promise was carried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready, Christina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was issued by Aunt Patricia. The old woman came to Christina\u0027s side and grabbed hold of her arm in a clawlike grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As ready as I shall ever be,\" Christina answered. She smiled at her guardian, then turned and walked into the throng of strangers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-5.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM"}
