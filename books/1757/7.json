Of course they\u0027ll go alone. There\u0027s nothing and nobody there, and they know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Care to join us?\" asked Bigman. \"If you leave your big mouth behind you can fit into a suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t crowd one even with yours,\" snarled Urteil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Gardoma said again, \"There\u0027s no point in going alone if... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A preliminary investigation,\" said Lucky, \"will do no harm. Actually, Urteil may be right. There may be no one there. At the worst, we\u0027ll keep in touch with you at the Dome and hope that we can handle any Sirians we meet. Bigman and I are used to handling tight situations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides which,\" added Bigman, his gnomish face puckering into a grin, \"Lucky and I like tight situations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky smiled and rose to his feet. \"If we may be excused... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrteil at once rose, turned, and stamped away. Lucky\u0027s eyes followed him thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky stopped Hartley Cook as the latter passed Mm. He touched his elbow gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook looked up, his eyes all concern. \"Yes. What is it, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said quietly, \"May I see you in our quarters as soon as possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there in fifteen minutes. Is that all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook was very little later than that. He stepped into their quarters softly, wearing the look of concern that seemed a constant part of him. He was a man in his late forties with an angular face and light brown hair that was beginning to be touched with gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I had forgotten to tell you where our quarters were. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook looked surprised. \"I knew where you were assigned,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good. Thank you for coming at our request.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Cook paused. Then he said hurriedly, \"Glad to. Glad to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"There\u0027s a small matter of the insulation suits in this room. The ones intended for use on the Sun-side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The inso-suits? We didn\u0027t forget the instruction film, did we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I viewed that. It\u0027s quite another thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook said, \"Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something wrong?\" crowed Bigman. \"Look for yourself.\" He spread the arms in order to display the slashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook looked blank, then flushed slowly and grew round-eyed with horror. \"I don\u0027t see... It\u0027s impos sible... Here at the Dome!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"The main thing is to get it replaced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But who would do such a thing? We must find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No use disturbing Dr. Peverale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" said Cook, at once, as though he had not thought of it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find out the details in due time. Meanwhile I would like to get it replaced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. I\u0027ll attend to it promptly. No wonder you wanted to see me. Great Space-- -\" He got to his feet in a kind of speechlessness and made as though to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lucky stopped him. \"Wait, this is a minor thing. There are other things we must discuss. By the way, before we get to that-I take it you did not agree with Dr. Peverale\u0027s views on the Sirians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook frowned. \"I\u0027d rather not discuss that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watched you as he was speaking. You disapproved, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook seat down again. His bony fingers clutched one another in a tight clasp and he said, \"He\u0027s an old man. He\u0027s been all mixed up about the Sirians for years. Psychopathic, almost. He sees them under his bed. He blames them for everything. If our plates are overexposed, he blames them. Since he\u0027s been back from Skius he\u0027s worse than ever, because of what he claims he went through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it he went through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing terrible, I suppose. But they quarantined him. They assigned him a separate building. They were too polite sometimes. They were too rude other times. There was no way of suiting him, I suppose. Then they forced a positronic robot on him to take care of personal services.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he object to that too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He claims it was because they wouldn\u0027t come near him themselves. That\u0027s what I mean. He took everything as an insult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook shook his head. \"Sirius would only accept one man, and he\u0027s senior. I ought to have gone. He\u0027s too old, really-too old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook was talking in a brooding sort of way. He looked up suddenly. \"This is all confidential, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Completely,\" Lucky assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your friend?\" said Cook uncertainly. \"I mean, I know he\u0027s honorable, but he\u0027s a little, uh, hotheaded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" began Bigman, stiffening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s affectionate hand came down on the little fellow\u0027s head and brushed his hair down on his forehead. \"He\u0027s hotheaded, all right,\" he said, \"as you saw at the banquet table. I can\u0027t always stop him in time and sometimes, when he\u0027s riled, he uses his tongue and his fist instead of his head. That\u0027s something I always have to keep in mind. Still, when I ask him specifically to keep quiet about something, he is quiet, and that\u0027s all there is to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky went on. \"To get back to my original question: Do you agree with Dr. Peverale concerning the Sirians in this present case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t. How would they know about Project Light, and why should they care? I don\u0027t see them sending ships and men and risking trouble with the Solar System just so they can break a few cables. Of course, I tell you this, Dr. Peverale has been feeling hurt for quite a while now... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Mindes and his group were established here while he was at Sirius. He came back and found them here. He knew they were coming eventually. It\u0027s been planned for years. Still, coming back and actually finding them here was a shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he tried to get rid of Mindes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no, nothing like that. He\u0027s even been friendly. It\u0027s just that it makes him feel that someday he\u0027ll be replaced altogether, maybe someday soon, and I suppose he hates the thought. So it\u0027s pleasant for him to take charge and start a big affair about Sirians. That\u0027s his baby, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded, then said, \"Tell me, have you ever been on Ceres?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook looked surprised at the change in subject but said, \"Occasionally. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With Dr. Peverale? Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With him, usually. He goes more frequently than I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky grinned. \"Were you there at the time the pirates made their raid on Ceres last year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook smiled too. \"No, but the old man was. We\u0027ve heard the story several times. He was very angry about it. He\u0027s practically never sick, and this one time he was just completely out. He missed everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s the way it goes... And, now, I think we\u0027d better get to the main business. I didn\u0027t like to bother Dr. Peverale. As you say, he\u0027s an old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re his second and quite a bit younger... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. What can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about the mines. I assume that somewhere at the Dome there are records, maps, charts, something which will tell us the arrangements of the main shafts and so on. Obviously, we can\u0027t wander at random.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure there are,\" agreed Cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can get them and perhaps go over them with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now as far as you know, Dr. Cook, the mines are in good shape, I hope. I mean, there\u0027s no danger of collapse or anything like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s nothing of the sort possible. We\u0027re built right over some of the shafts, and we had to look into the engineering when the Observatory was first being set up. The shafts are well-buttressed and completely safe, particularly in Mercury\u0027s gravity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come,\" asked Bigman, \"the mines were shut down, if they\u0027re in such good shape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A good question,\" said Cook, and a small smile broke through his expression of settled melancholy. \"Do you want the true explanation or the interesting one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both,\" said Bigman at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook offered smokes to the others which were refused, then lit a cigarette after tamping it on the back of one hand in an abstracted manner. \"The truth is this. Mercury is quite dense, and there were hopes that it would be a rich source of the heavy metals: lead, silver, mercury, platinum. It was, too; not as rich as might be, perhaps, but rich enough. Unfortunately, it was uneconomic. Supporting the mines here and transporting the ore back to Earth or even the Moon for processing raised the price too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the interesting explanation, that\u0027s another thing completely. When the Observatory was first set up fifty years ago, the mines were still a going concern, though they were already closing down some of the shafts. The original astronomers heard stories from the miners and passed it on to the newcomers. It\u0027s part of the Mercurian legendry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the stories?\" asked Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems miners died in the shafts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sands of Mars!\" cried Bigman testily. \"They die anywhere. You think anybody lives forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These were frozen to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a mysterious free/ing. The shafts were fairly well heated in those days, and their suit power units were in operation. The stories accumulate embroidery, you know, and, eventually miners wouldn\u0027t go into the main shafts in anything but gangs, wouldn\u0027t go into the side shafts at all, and the mines shut down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded. He said, \"You\u0027ll get the plans for the mines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right off. And replacements for that inso-suit too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreparations proceeded as though for a major expedition. A new inso-suit, replacing the one that had been slashed, was brought and tested, then laid to one side. After all, it would be ordinary space-suits for the dark-side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charts were brought and studied. Together with Cook, Lucky sketched out a possible route of exploration, following the main shafts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky left Bigman to take care of packing the adjunct-units with homogenized food and with water (which could be swallowed while still in the suit), make sure of the charge of the power units and the pressure on the oxygen tanks, inspect the working efficiency of the waste disposal unit and the moisture recirculator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe himself made a short trip to their ship, the Shooting Starr. He made the trip via the surface, carrying a field pack, the contents of which he did not discuss with Bigman. He returned without it but carrying two small objects that looked like thick belt buckles, slightly curved, in dull-steel finish and centered by a rectangle in glassy red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" asked Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Microergometers,\" said Lucky. \"Experimental. You know, like the ergometers on board ship except that those are bolted to the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can these things detect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing at a couple of hundred thousand miles like a ship\u0027s ergometer, but it can detect atomic power sources at ten miles, maybe. Look, Bigman, you activate it here. See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s thumbnail exerted pressure against a small slit in one side of the mechanism. A sliver of metal moved in, then out, and instantly the red patch on the surface glowed brightly. Lucky turned the small ergometer in this direction and that. In one particular position, the red patch glowed with the energy of a nova.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" said Lucky, \"is probably the direction of the Dome\u0027s power plant. We can adjust the mechanism to zero that out. It\u0027s a little tricky.\" He worked painstakingly on the adjustment of two small controls so smoothly inset as nearly to be invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled as he worked, his engagingly youthful face lighting with pleasure. \"You know, Bigman, there isn\u0027t a time I visit Uncle Hector but that he doesn\u0027t load me up with the Council\u0027s latest gadgets. He claims that with the chances you and I are always taking (you know the way he talks) we need them. Sometimes, though, I think he just wants us to act as field-testers for the gadgets. This one, though, may be useful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How, Lucky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For one thing, Bigman, if there are Sirians in the mines, they\u0027ll have a small atomic power plant. They\u0027ll have to. They\u0027ll need power for heat, for electrolyzing water, and so on. This ergometer should detect that at ample distance. And for another thing-- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell silent, and Bigman\u0027s lips compressed in chagrin. He knew what that silence meant. Lucky had thoughts which later he would claim had been too vague to talk about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is one of the ergometers for me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet,\" said Lucky, tossing one of the ergometers toward him. Bigman snatched it out of the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanley Cook was waiting for them when they stepped out of their quarters, wearing their suits but with headpieces tucked under their arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I thought I\u0027d lead you as far as the nearest entrance to the shafts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the tail end of the sleeping period in the Dome. Human beings always established an Earth-like alternation of waking and sleeping, even where there was no day and night to guide them. Lucky had chosen this time on purpose, since he did not want to enter the mines at the head of a curious procession. In this Dr. Peverale had co-operated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridors of the Dome were empty. The lighting was dimmed. And as they walked, a heavy silence seemed to fall about them while the clank of their footsteps sounded even louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook stopped. \"This is Entry Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded. \"All right. I hope we\u0027ll be seeing one another again soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook operated the lock with his usual gloomy gravity, while Lucky and Bigman put on their headpieces, clamping them firmly along the paramagnetic seams. Lucky took his first breath of canned air with what was almost pleasure, he was so accustomed to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky first, then Bigman, stepped into the air lock. The wall closed behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Ready, Bigman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet, Lucky.\" His words rang in Lucky\u0027s radio receiver, and his small form was a shadow in the extremely dim light of the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the opposing wall opened. They could feel the puff of air escaping into vacuum, and they stepped forward through the opening once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA touch at the outer controls and the wall closed behind them again. This time, light was shut off altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in absolute darkness, they found themselves inside the silent and empty mines of Mercury. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-big-sun-of-mercury-lucky-starr-4/page-7.html","bookId":1757,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM"}
