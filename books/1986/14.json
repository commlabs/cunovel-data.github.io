I was a little late but I had a hard time leaving Will ow at work after the way I\u0027d found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn she\u0027d been upset. I hadn\u0027t even met this sister and I really disliked her. If it wasn\u0027t for the fact she was Larissa\u0027s mom I\u0027d hate her. I wanted to tell her I knew how screwed up family relationships could be but dropping my crap on her seemed unfair. Will ow was sensitive. She\u0027d only worry over me and I wanted her happy. Giving her more to stress over wouldn\u0027t do either of us any good. Besides I wasn\u0027t alone in this. I had Amanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the front door I walked in without knocking. It was family dinner night. Next week I intended to bring Will ow with me. I wanted her to meet my Mom. I\u0027d just need to find out her work schedule and we\u0027d make sure to have family dinner on a night Will ow was available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well it\u0027s about time you drug your love sick tail in here,\" Amanda teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. No use in denying it. I wasn\u0027t in love yet. But I could easily see it going there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovesick?\" Mom asked stepping out of the kitchen with her stark white apron on with the lace stuff around the bottom and a glass of white wine in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes lovesick. You should see him with her mom. He\u0027s all sweet and possessive. It\u0027s adorable and slightly nauseating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom\u0027s face brightened at Amanda\u0027s description. She\u0027d been worried about me this summer after the Sadie fiasco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why didn\u0027t you bring her tonight? I want to see this nauseating scene myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over and hugged my mom because I knew she needed the affection and I was just so glad to see her smile again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will next week. She\u0027s working tonight. When I find out her off nights next week I\u0027ll let you know and we can pick a night she\u0027s available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom kissed one cheek and patted my other one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" she replied then turned and walked back into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cage know yet?\" Amanda asked in a low voice as she sidled up beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I moved her out of his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda\u0027s eyes flew open as wide as they\u0027d go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he didn\u0027t kick you out?\" She sounded shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And take Low with me? No. He\u0027d never do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, didn\u0027t think about that. Smart move bro.\" I shrugged, \"I\u0027m pretty dang brilliant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlapping me on the back of my head she walked around me and led the way to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we had all the food on the table and the three of us were seated, Mom cleared her throat, \"Okay there is something I wanted to tell you both. Since our last little chat I\u0027ve made some decisions.\" The look of apprehension on her face worried me. That couldn\u0027t be good. Taking a long swig of my sweet tea I waited for her to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve spoken with your father this week. Several times. I did bring up the possibility of a divorce. I told him that if he wanted out then fine. I\u0027d let him go,\" she paused and twisted the napkin in her hands nervously. Also not a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t want a divorce. We both believe he has been going through a midlife crisis,\" she held up her hand when I opened my mouth very close to yelling \"bull shit\" at my mother\u0027s dinner table. \"Don\u0027t Marcus. Let me finish,\" she pleaded. I couldn\u0027t look back at Amanda. This was just going to give her hope. I hated to see the relief on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing it would only hurt her even more when Dad screwed up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t been our age or lived our life. These things happen. A midlife crisis is very common. I understand it even if I don\u0027t like it. Your father is letting the girl go. She won\u0027t be working with him any longer. He\u0027s coming home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to work on mending what has been broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I need both of you to stand behind me, us. Having you angry at your father won\u0027t help me,\" she swallowed hard and I saw the tears glistening in her blue eyes. \"I want him to remember how good this family can be together. I want him to want us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there unable to make eye contact with my sister. I knew she was behind this one hundred percent. I also knew my mom wanted this to work. Dad had given her hope. My getting angry and pointing out the multiple issues with this set up would only upset them. It wouldn\u0027t change their minds. Nothing I said would change their minds. They wanted him that much. So I did the only thing I could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay Mama. Whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething had upset Marcus. He\u0027d been his usual attentive, thoughtful self since he\u0027d picked me up but I could feel his anger under the surface. It had to do with his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had dinner with them tonight. That much I knew. But I couldn\u0027t ask him, not when I wasn\u0027t willing to open up to him about my family problems. If he wanted to tell me, he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts shifted to Larissa. I stared up at the ceiling knowing sleep probably wouldn\u0027t happen for me tonight. As tired as I was my mind wouldn\u0027t shut down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened slowly startling me and I sat up in bed expecting to see Marcus. It was Cage. Frowning I pulled the sheet up over Marcus\u0027s t-shirt I was sleeping in. The last thing I needed was for him to have an angry fit in Marcus\u0027s bedroom while he was no doubt drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cage,\" I hissed quietly, \"wrong room.\" He didn\u0027t listen to me and closed the door behind him before walking over to the bed and sitting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not that drunk. I know whose room this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and let out a sigh, \"I missed you and going into my empty bedroom and getting in my empty bed sucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well you can\u0027t sleep in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned and I reached out and squeezed his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Just wanted to see you. I thought you\u0027d be asleep. I figured if I watched you a little bit I could go to my room and go to sleep with that image in my head.\" He could be so dang sweet. Cage didn\u0027t do well with change. He never had. This was a change that was going to be really hard on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry but he makes me happy Cage.\" His frown deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? That list could be endless. But I knew the one answer that would shut Cage down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m enough for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage dropped his head into his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I so screwed up Low? Why can\u0027t I be like him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck is wrong with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart broke a little. Memories of the bruises covering his body and gashes on his forehead and cheek all gifts from his step-father flashed in my mind. He and I both had issues. Mine were just different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our life hasn\u0027t been easy,\" I replied reaching out to run my hand over his head of black silky hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his hands down enough so that I could see his eyes, \"But you don\u0027t have issues with commitment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No and no one beat me either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were abandoned. By a man who was too stupid to know what an awesome daughter he had and even though your mom was there she wasn\u0027t, not really.\" Larissa\u0027s little face today as she cried because I was leaving her came back to me and a tear rolled down my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he reached out and caught my tear, \"What\u0027s this? I didn\u0027t mean to make you cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and grabbed his wrist. \"No, you didn\u0027t. It\u0027s I shook my head and grabbed his wrist. \"No, you didn\u0027t. It\u0027s Larissa,\" I stopped myself. I needed to tell someone. I needed to talk about this. And Cage knew. He knew what I\u0027d lived through. He\u0027d understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met her father today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage\u0027s eyes opened wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep, and he\u0027s married and old. Says he\u0027s leaving his wife and going to come take Larissa and Tawny away from it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage didn\u0027t ask me what was wrong with this. He didn\u0027t have to. He\u0027d held me when I\u0027d found out my father had skipped town with his real family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, damn,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he will Low. Maybe he won\u0027t do to her what your dad did to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No, don\u0027t you see. If he leaves his wife then Tawny has broken up a marriage. Someone else is heartbroken. He\u0027ll hurt someone either way. He\u0027s married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s already promised God he\u0027d cherish his wife. Now he has not one but two families. One of those families will suffer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage blew out a long breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence for a few minutes. I looked past him toward the door and thought of Marcus sleeping out on the couch. I didn\u0027t want him to catch Cage in here. He still didn\u0027t understand the relationship Cage and I had. This would upset him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for listening to me. But,\" I nodded toward the door hating to tell him to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a sad smile and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I need to get out of here before lover boy catches me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and blew me a kiss before leaving the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay back down and closed my eyes this time. Saying my fears out loud had helped. Sleep slowly found me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFluttery kisses trailed down my face and I turned to the warmth beside me. When Marcus\u0027s clean scent reached my nose I opened my eyes. He wasn\u0027t under the covers with me. That was my first observation. He had on a t-shirt. That was my second observation. His breath smelled minty fresh and with that observation I tucked my head against his shoulder so he couldn\u0027t smell my morning breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chuckle sent shivers through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027re you hiding,\" his fresh breath tickled my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t brushed my teeth,\" I mumbled He laughed out loud this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure your morning breath is just as sweet as you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, no, trust me it stinks like the rest of the world\u0027s,\" I assured him refusing to tilt my face back and look up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay fine hide your face from me but I\u0027ll tell you I don\u0027t like missing out on your sleepy look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sleepy look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your sleepy look. When you first open your eyes in the morning you have the sexiest expression. Your eyelids don\u0027t open all the way and those long eyelashes of yours brush your cheeks and your bottom lip is all swol en from nibbling on it in your sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. Okay I was completely turned on. And I had stinky breath. Fabulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned against his chest. \"That just makes me want to flip you over and climb on top of you and kiss you senseless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please by all means be my guest. I won\u0027t stop you.\" Laughing I slapped his chest and sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay put and let me go do a little morning freshen up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t move,\" I pointed at him to emphasize my demand before sprinting toward the bathroom and brushing my teeth. Then my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning back into the bedroom I had to stop and sigh from happiness at the sight he made leaning against the head board. He had on a t-shirt but he was in boxers and his long tanned legs were crossed. And Marcus Hardy\u0027s bare feet were downright sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my gaze back up to his face and he was smirking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I meet your approval?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing I continued over to the bed but my early threat to jump on top of him seemed a little too extreme. Instead, I curled up beside him and tilted my head up at him this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? No crawling on top of me and having your wild wicked way with me?\" The teasing in his voice made my stomach flutter. Feeling slightly brave now he\u0027d brought it up, I threw a leg over his lap and straddled him. His smile disappeared and his eyes flashed with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see I believe the next step is this,\" I whispered taking his face in my hands and then leaning down and kissing him with small quick pecks all over his lips. Both corners and even the tip of his nose. His hands slid up my outer thighs and underneath my t-shirt to grab my waist. Finding my way back down to his lips I took a small lap at his bottom lip then pulled it into my mouth and sucked. A groan erupted from his chest and his mouth opened and immediately he took over. His tongue tangled with mine while we explored each other. He sucked on my tongue surprising me and I leaned in closer pressing down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gasped at the same time as the heat that had been pooling between my legs made contact with his obvious arousal. As if my body knew what to do on instinct I rocked against the pressure that was causing wild jolts of pleasure to course through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus began breathing hard and his kissing became more intense. His mouth left mine and I cried out as he began kissing down my neck and stopping to nibble and lick at sensitive skin along the way. Something was happening inside of me that scared me but was so exciting I couldn\u0027t stop. I continued rocking and Marcus grip on my waist tightened as he pressed me down even closer to the wonderful pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"AGH, God baby,\" his head fell back against the headboard and I paused panting and achy but worried I\u0027d hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What,\" I managed to ask in a strangled whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and both his hands left my waist and grabbed my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You. Are. Driving. Me. Crazy.\" He took short breaths after each word before claiming my mouth again. I took that as a good thing and rocked against him one more time and then my world fell apart. It was as if someone had lit a bottle rocket between my legs. The scream I knew was mine sounded like it belonged to someone else as I held onto Marcus afraid I\u0027d fall if I let go. What had I done? And could I do it again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my heart began to slow down and breathing was once again possible I realized I was wrapped tightly in Marcus\u0027s arms and my head was tucked into the curve of his neck and shoulder. Holy. Cow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still had a death grip on Marcus\u0027s arms and I slowly peeled my hands away hoping I hadn\u0027t left fingernail cuts on his skin although I don\u0027t see how I could have kept from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had I done? How could I look at him? What was I supposed to say? Did he think I was insane? I was pretty sure I\u0027d just screamed like a banshee. It was a miracle Cage hadn\u0027t come bursting in. Marcus stroked my hair as if comforting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low,\" his voice was husky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I replied keeping my face safely buried in his neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAw crap. Slowly I pulled back immediately missing the warmth of my little safe haven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my eyes to meet his and a slow sexy smile instantly eased my mind. His eyes were hooded as if he\u0027d just woken up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked holding my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt heat rush to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... I uh,\" what did I say? I\u0027m sorry for going crazy in your lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low,\" he reached out and ran his hand through my hair then rested it on my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that your first orgasm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell no freaking wonder. I completely understood the fascination with those things now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding I knew my face flushed even brighter. His grin grew to a full one hundred watt smile. He was obviously very pleased with this. Well, that was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you enjoy it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a small burst of laughter. He did not just ask me that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say the fact I completely acted like a crazy person tells you that I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled and leaned forward and kissed me once on the lips then leaned back. The friction made me gasp. Oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still... hard. Weren\u0027t they supposed to not be hard anymore once a guy got off... which meant he hadn\u0027t. Oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You uh,\" I glanced down praying he didn\u0027t move again because for some reason I was really sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay.
