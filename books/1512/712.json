After all, they had a psyche force user, and they at least wouldn’t be ambushed while moving. They also had mental and physical preparation before combat. In such a battle, if there wasn’t too much of a disparity in strength, the side without a psyche force user would almost surely lose, especially when it was a two on one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHowever, this was if there wasn’t too much of a disparity in power...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eYingkong’s walking speed wasn’t too fast. She looked incomparably relaxed, going at a trot and her hands making the posture of holding a sword. When the distance between team East Sea and her was one corridor, she suddenly waved her hands, and the invisible heavy sword in her hands slashed towards the side of the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThere was a soft tearing sound. The transparent heavy sword ripped through metal like it was paper, a horizontal slash actually cleaving apart the walls of the passageway. It directly crossed the wall, chopping towards the two outside the passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eBefore Koinu Maosu could respond, Miyata Kuraki’s expression abruptly changed greatly. He suddenly pushed Koinu Maosu down, while his unsheathed his katana, moving it upwards. The sound of metal colliding rang out and the katana nearly shattered. However the force still sent him and Koinu Maosu sliding several metres back, only stopping after they slammed into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“So strong…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eMiyata Kuraki jumped up from the ground. He grasped his katana tightly, reciting something under his breath. Then, he anxiously said mentally, “Koinu Maosu! Transform quickly! This is an extremely powerful person! This is the moment our life and death will be decided…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eAs his words fell, the delicate figure of a girl emerged from the side of the passageway. Her footsteps were light, her hands seemingly weaponless. However, her hands grasped the air, seeming to be holding some kind of special weapon. She didn\u0027t look particularly intimidating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eKoinu Maosu had originally been anxious, but he immediately jumped up from the ground upon seeing the current situation. “Kuraki, this is the so strong you spoke of? What a joke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Fool…” Miyata Kuraki didn\u0027t even dare look at Koinu Maosu. He merely mumbled, “Her killing intent are like vast waves, and it’s the first time I’ve seen one so dense. Can you not sense a single thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eObviously, Koinu Maosu indeed couldn\u0027t sense it. The disparity was so utterly vast that he couldn\u0027t even sense Yingkong’s level of strength. However, he could still be considered to be obedient to Miyata Kuraki’s words. He howled when he heard the order, the muscles all over his body swelling up as if they were alive, until his entire self swelled up by fifty percent, actually reaching two metres in height. He looked like a small giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“HAH!” The muscles on Koinu Maosu’s body had finished swelling up. He pounced at Yingkong with a roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eYingkong wasn’t flustered, charging forward to welcome the two. She raised Excalibur aloft, chopping downwards. She easily cut the muscles on Koinu Maosu’s body. Unexpectedly, the heavy sword only dug three tenths into his muscles. The muscles were as tough as steel, and Koinu Maosu closed in in the instant he was injured. The heavy sword was stuck in place, and Koinu Maosu had already crashed into her with a howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eKoinu Maosu’s enhancement should be similar to that man from team India in the past, or even the same. The Yingkong then wouldn\u0027t necessarily have been able to dodge this level of attack, and would have suffered some light injuries even if she had dodged. However, she had still entered God’s Realm for a long time after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHer strength had risen by a large amount, especially with the resurgence of her main personality. In the instant Koinu Maosu crashed into her, the little girl placed her palm on the front of his body, and leapt up with a step. She passed over his head like he was a wall and jumped behind him. In the same moment she passed over, her two legs went in opposite directions and hooked his throat. It seemed that she wanted to use the momentum from passing over to snap his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHowever, it wasn\u0027t just Koinu Maosu present. Miyata Kuraki followed after hot on his heels. He wordlessly used the katana in his hand to slash as Yingkong’s neck like lightning. The strike was completely traceless, and as Miyata Kuraki’s swords arts had already reached a certain standard, even Yingkong had to abandon the attack on Koinu Maosu. She could only raise Excalibur to forcibly block this strike. With another clang, Yingkong used the force to retreat several metres away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(Not good, the gap from her is still so large…) Yingkong sighed slightly internally. If it had been her main personality just now, Koinu Maosu would surely have become a corpse lying there with its head snapped. The difference in strength was so large, the disparity remaining as wide as before even with her great improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Again!” Yingkong shouted lovably. She charged forward once more, holding Excalibur. The first to be attacked was Koinu Maosu. The baldie had been frightened just now and was sweating buckets. His neck had been wrenched slightly, and was still secretly very painful. When Yingkong charged forward again, his right fist shot out with a loud howl. It came crashing towards Yingkong with enormous force, but just as the fist shot out halfway, Yingkong unexpectedly didn’t use her word to slash at him, but instead used her hands to grab his wrist. She went along with his momentum and jerked backwards, and the wrist was directed downwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eKoinu Maosu immediately howled miserably and subconsciously kicked at Yingkong. However, it let her push against it with a palm, allowing her to narrowly avoid an incoming slash. It was a close call, with the katana practically brushing against her hair as it passed. Only when she had retreated several metres did her hair slowly drift down. This time, even Yingkong was breaking out in cold sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(It’s too difficult. The other me’s strength has gone through an unknown amount of tempering, and has the fourth stage infinitesimal control to help. Only then can she handle difficult battles with ease and be peerless in close combat. My strength is still too inferior compared to her in the end…) Yingkong complained internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eShe still had a stubborn disposition and wasn\u0027t the kind to give up. She shouted lovable again, “Again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eFinished speaking, she charged at the two again. Looking at her, it was as if she felt she had suffered some grievances. However, the two before her were quaking with terror. In actuality, her mentality wasn\u0027t much different from Zheng’s. She was using the two to test her techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Maosu! Go all-out! This girl is incredibly skilled. We’ll die sooner or later if she holds us up here!” Miyata Kuraki shouted mentally at Koinu Maosu. At the same time, he made a backhand cut on his arm. He then unexpectedly began using his blood to rub all over his body. The odd runes all over his skin and face began to gradually emit a black light when the blood was rubbed over, and Miyata Kuraki’s entire body was shrouded within a layer of faint black light within a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Team China’s combatant.

He was intimately familiar with these gunshots. They were the gunshots of Gauss pistols, and his heart instantly jumped. His foot stepped down and he rushed over to Xuan’s room.

He was prepared to enter a battle with a stranger, only to see everyone sitting there safe and sound. There was only the addition of a corpse of a slender and tall man with an astonished expression lying there.

The entire destroyer even trembled, then several more booms resounded. Zheng couldn’t say anything in time, and brilliance abruptly shone around his body. He borrowed this force to speed towards the place the booms came from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eZheng’s speed was incredible, and he had crossed several passageway in the blink of an eye. Footprints were left behind in his wake, and the passageway the booms had come from had caved in by the time he reached. A current of warm air rushed towards him, and much metal had already melted. However, there wasn’t a soul left in the passageway. Zheng didn’t hesitate to turn and leave for the ship’s hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThis back and forth didn’t even take ten seconds. When he rushed there, he saw three men and the unconscious Yingkong. They were currently riding on a giant eagle of length ten metre with its wings extended. The giant eagle extended its wings and brought the four flying away with an unordinary speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eZheng’s Soru could naturally catch up to the three. However, when he saw that Yingkong wasn\u0027t hurt, merely unconscious, he finally slowed down and came to a halt on the deck. The three looked back, with a muscular baldie especially laughing hard. His hand grabbed Yingkong’s neck and lifted her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“... Want to die?” Zheng’s eyes turned grim. He howled, a sound that the three naturally caught. They saw Zheng pull the railing next to him over, and snap off a metal rod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eWithout making any stance, he simply exerted force and threw it at the three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eBefore the three could recover from their shock, the metal rod had already embedded itself in the arm the muscular baldie was using to hold Yingkong. The force directly ripped his arm off, and the giant eagle was already several hundred metres away from the destroyer at this point. Gradually, the three and the giant eagle disappeared into the endless night...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://wiki.dfo-world.com/view/Male_Slayer\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003eGhost Knight\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003e, alternatively named Male Slayer, is a class from the MMO,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Fighter_Online\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003eDungeon Fighter Online\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://wiki.dfo-world.com/view/Ghost_Slash\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003eGhost Slash\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_1\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;is an Active Skill of this class.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_2\"\u003e[2]\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://yuyuhakusho.wikia.com/wiki/Younger_Toguro\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_2\"\u003eYounger Toguro\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_2\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;is a character from Yu Yu Hakusho.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-22-chapter-9-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-22-chapter-10-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-22-chapter-9-2","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
