French Landing, Wisconsin. A comfortable, solid middle-American town inhabited by comfortable, solid middle-Americans! and a serial killer. Three children have been lost -- taken by a monster with a taste for child\u0027s flesh nicknamed \u0027The Fisherman\u0027 after a legendary murderer. It\u0027s all way beyond the experience of the local police, whose only hope lies with ex-detective Jack Sawyer, the man who cracked their last case for them. But, plagued by visions of another world, Jack has retired to this rural retreat precisely to avoid such horrors -- and, having recognized the touch of madness on this case, he\u0027s keeping well away. Soon, he\u0027ll have no choice. Young Tyler Marshall, left behind one afternoon by his bullying friends, pedals past the local old folks\u0027 home and is accosted by a crow. \u0027Gorg,\u0027 it caws, and \u0027Ty.\u0027 What ten-year-old could resist a bird that speaks his name? Not Ty, that\u0027s for sure. And as he follows the mysterious crow, he\u0027s grabbed by the neck and dragged into a hedge. The Fisherman has made another catch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/black-house-the-talisman-2.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/black-house-the-talisman-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:09:17 PM"}
