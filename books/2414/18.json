She salvaged the old, stored them in the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou just never knew, to her mind, when you might need an old door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d opted for mahogany-damn the budget-in an elegantly simple Craftman style. The three-over-three seeded glass panes on the entrance door would let in the light, and still afford some privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucker fit, she thought with pleasure after one of the laborers helped her haul it into position. Fit like a fricking dream. She waited until she was alone to stroke her hands over the wood and purr, \"Hello, gorgeous. You\u0027re all mine now.\" Humming under her breath, she went to work on the lock set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d gone with the oil-rubbed bronze she\u0027d chosen for other areas of the house and, as she began the install on the lock set, decided she\u0027d made the perfect choice. The dark tones of the bronze showed off well against the subtle red hues in the mahogany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nice-looking door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over her shoulder to see her father stepping out of his car. Cilla was so used to seeing him in what she thought of as his teacher clothes, it took her a minute to adjust her brain to the jeans, T-shirt and ball cap he wore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curb appeal,\" she called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certainly getting that.\" He paused to look over the front lawns. The grass had been neatly mowed, with its bare patches resowed and the tender new shoots protected by a thin layer of straw. The plantings had begun there, too, with young azaleas and rhododendrons, a clutch of hydrangeas already heading up, a slim red maple with its leaves glowing in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still got some work, and I won\u0027t put in the flower beds until next spring, unless I manage to put in some fall stuff. But it\u0027s coming along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done an amazing job so far.\" He joined her on the veranda, close enough she caught a whiff of what she thought might be Irish Spring. He studied the door, the lock set. \"That looks sturdy. I\u0027m glad to see it. What about the security system? Word gets around,\" he added when she raised her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping that word would. It might be as much of a deterrent as the system itself. Which went in yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hazel eyes tracked to hers, solemnly. \"I wish you\u0027d called me, Cilla, about the vandalism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing you could\u0027ve done about it. Give me a second here, I\u0027m nearly done.\" She whirled the last screws in place, then set aside the cordless screwdriver before admiring the result. \"Yeah, it looks good. I almost went with a plate style, but thought it would look too heavy. This is better. \" She opened and closed the door a couple of times. \"Good. I\u0027m using the same style on the back entry, but decided to go with an atrium on... sorry. You couldn\u0027t possibly be interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I\u0027m interested in what you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little surprised by the hurt in his tone, she turned to give him her full attention. \"I just meant the odd details-knob or lever style, sliding, swinging, luminary. Do you want to come in?\" She opened the door again. \"It\u0027s noisy, but it\u0027s cooler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla, what can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... Look, I\u0027m sorry.\" God, she was lousy at this father-daughter thing. How could she be otherwise? \"I didn\u0027t mean to imply you don\u0027t care what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla.\" Gavin closed the door again to block off the noise from inside. \"What can I do to help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt guilty, and a little panicked, as her mind went blank. \"Help me with what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a sigh, shoved his hands into his pockets. \"I\u0027m not a do-it-yourselfer, but I can hammer a nail or put in a screw. I can fetch and carry. I can make iced tea or go pick up sandwiches. I can use a broom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You... want to work on the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"School\u0027s out for the summer, and I didn\u0027t take on any summer classes. I have some time to help, and I\u0027d like to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m aware you have plenty of people, people who know what they\u0027re doing, that you\u0027re paying to do it. But, I\u0027ve never done anything for you. I sent child support. I was legally obligated to. I hope you know, or can believe, I\u0027d have sent it without that obligation. I didn\u0027t teach you to ride a bike, or to drive a car. I never put toys together for you on Christmas Eve or your birthday-or the few times I did you were too young to possibly remember. I never helped you with your homework or lay in bed waiting for you to come home from a date so I could sleep. I never did any of those things for you, or hundreds more. So I\u0027d like to do something for you now. Something tangible. If you\u0027ll let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart fluttered, the oddest combination of pleasure and distress. It seemed vital she think of something, the right something, and her mind went on a desperate scavenger hunt. \"Ah. Ever done any painting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the tension in his face melt into a delighted smile. \"As a matter of fact, I\u0027m an excellent painter. Do you want references?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back at him. \"I\u0027ll give you a trial run. Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led him in and through to the living room. She hadn\u0027t scheduled painting this area quite yet, but there was no reason against it. \"The plasterwork\u0027s done, and I\u0027ve removed the trim. Had to. Some of it needed to be stripped, and that\u0027s done. I\u0027m still working on making what I need to replicate and replace damaged areas, then I\u0027ll stain and seal. Anyway, you won\u0027t have to tape or cut in around trim. Oh, and don\u0027t worry about the brick on the fireplace, either. I\u0027m going to cover that with granite. Or marble. There\u0027s no work going on in this area right now, so you won\u0027t be in anyone\u0027s way, and they shouldn\u0027t be in yours. We can drop-cloth the floors and the supplies stored here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her fists on her hips. \"Got your stepladder, your pans, rollers, brushes right over there. Primer\u0027s in those ten-gallon cans, and marked. Finish paint\u0027s labeled with the L.R. for living room. I hit a sale on Duron, so I bought it in advance. You won\u0027t get past starting the primer anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran through her mental checklist. \"So... do you want me to help you set up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Listen, it\u0027s a big job, so knock off anytime you get tired of it. I\u0027m going to be working on the back door if you need anything meanwhile. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Ah... I\u0027ll check in after I\u0027m done with the kitchen door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away twice during the process of replacing the door-once for the sheer pleasure of walking up and down her newly completed outside stairs. They required staining, sealing, and the doorway cut into what would be her office suite would be blocked with plywood until she installed that door. But the stairs themselves delighted her so much she executed an impromptu dance number on the way down, to the applause and whistles of the crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father and the painting slipped her mind for over three hours. With twin pangs of guilt and concern, she hurried into the living room, fully expecting to see a weekend DIYer\u0027s amateurish mess. Instead, she saw a competently dropped area, a primed ceiling and two primed walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her father, whistling a cheery tune, as he rolled primer on the next wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hired,\" she said from behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the roller, chuckled, turned. \"Will work for lemonade.\" He picked up a tall glass. \"I got some out of the kitchen. And caught your act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Ginger Rogers down the stairs. Outside. You looked so happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. The pitch, the landings, the switchbacks. An engineering feat, brought to you by Cilla McGowan and Matt Brewster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot you could dance like that. I haven\u0027t seen you dance since... You were still a teenager when I came to your concert in D.C. I remember coming backstage before curtain. You were white as a sheet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stage fright. I hated that concert series. I hated performing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perform? No, there\u0027s performing and there\u0027s playing around. That was playing around. Which you\u0027re obviously not, here. This is a really good job. And you?\" She walked over for a closer inspection-and damn if she couldn\u0027t still smell the soap on him. \"You barely have a dot of paint on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years of experience, between painting sets at school and Patty\u0027s redecorating habit. It looks so different in here,\" he added. \"With the doorway there widened, the way it changes the shape of the room and opens it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, honey. Homes are meant to change, to reflect the people who live in them. And I think you\u0027ll understand what I mean when I say she\u0027s still here. Janet\u0027s still here.\" He touched her shoulder, then just left his hand there, connecting them. \"So are my grandparents, my father. Even me, a little. What I see here is a revival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to see where the stairs lead? My garret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got a kick out of showing him around, seeing his interest in her design and plans for her office. It surprised her to realize his approval brought her such satisfaction. In the way, she supposed, it was satisfying to show off to someone ready to be impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll keep working on houses,\" he said as they started down the unfinished attic steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the plan. Rehabbing either for myself to flip, or for clients. Remodeling. Possibly doing some consulting. It hinges on getting my contractor\u0027s license. I can do a lot without it, but with it, I can do more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you go about getting a license?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take the test for it tomorrow.\" She held up both hands, fingers crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow? Why aren\u0027t you studying? says the teacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, I have. Studied my brains out, took the sample test on-line. Twice.\" She paused by the guest bath. \"This room\u0027s finished-for the second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is one that was vandalized?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You\u0027d never know it,\" she said, crouching down to run her fingers over the newly laid tile. \"I guess that\u0027s what counts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What counts is you weren\u0027t hurt. When I think about what happened to Steve...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing good. I talked to him yesterday. His physical therapy\u0027s going well, which may in part be due to the fact that the therapist is a babe. Do you think Hennessy could have done it?\" she asked on impulse. \"Is he capable, physically, character-wise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to think so, when it comes to his character. But the fact is, he\u0027s never stopped hating.\"After a pause, Gavin let out a sigh. \"I\u0027d have to say he hates more now than he did when it happened. Physically? Well, he\u0027s a tough old bird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk to him, get a sense. I just haven\u0027t decided how to approach it. On the other hand, if it was him, I\u0027m not sure that wouldn\u0027t get him even more riled up. I haven\u0027t had any problems for nearly two weeks now. I\u0027d like to keep it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been out of town for a few days. He and his wife are visiting her sister. Up in Vermont, I think it is. My neighbor\u0027s boy mows their lawn,\" Gavin explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConvenient, she thought as her father went back to painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd since the living area was getting painted, she decided to set up her tools outside and get to work on the trim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN THE MORNING, Cilla decided she\u0027d been foolish and shortsighted to bar Ford from the house the night before. She hadn\u0027t wanted any distractions while she reviewed her test manual, and had planned on an early night and a solid eight hours\u0027 sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead she\u0027d obsessed about the test, pacing the house, second-guessing herself. When she slept, she tossed and turned with anxiety dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result she woke tense, edgy and half sick with nerves. She forced herself to eat half a bagel, then wished she hadn\u0027t as even that churned uneasily in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked the contents of her bag three times to make absolutely certain it held everything she could possibly need, then left the house a full thirty minutes early, just in case she ran into traffic or got lost. Couldn\u0027t find a parking place, she added as she locked the front door. Was abducted by aliens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knock it off, knock it off,\" she mumbled as she strode to her pickup. It wasn\u0027t as if the fate of the damn world rested on her test score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust hers, she thought. Just her entire future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could wait. She could take the test down the road, wait just a little longer. After she\u0027d finished the house. After she\u0027d settled in. After...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStage fright, she thought with a sigh. Performance anxiety and fear of failure all wrapped up in a slippery ribbon. With her stomach knotted, she opened the truck door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a sound that was part laugh, part awww.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sketch lay on the seat, where, she supposed, Ford had put it sometime the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in work boots, a tool belt slung from her hips like a holster. As if she\u0027d drawn them from it, she held a nail gun in one hand, a measuring tape in the other. Around her were stacks of lumber, coils of wire, piles of brick. Safety goggles dangled from a strap around her neck, and work gloves peeked out of the pocket of her carpenter pants. Her face carried a determined, almost arrogant expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow her feet, the caption read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE AMAZING, THE INCREDIBLE CONTRACTOR GIRL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t miss a trick, do you?\" she said aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked across the road, blew a kiss to where she imagined he lay sleeping. When she climbed into the truck and turned on the engine, all the knots had unraveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the sketch riding on the seat beside her, Cilla turned on the music and drove toward her future, singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORD SETTLED on his front veranda with his laptop, his sketchbook, a pitcher of iced tea and a bag of Doritos to share with Spock. He couldn\u0027t be sure when Cilla might make it back. The drive to and from Richmond was a bitch even without rush hour factored in. Added to it, he couldn\u0027t be sure how long the exam ran, or what she might do after to wind down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo around two in the afternoon, he stationed himself where he couldn\u0027t miss her return and kept himself busy. He sent and answered e-mail, checked in with the blogs and boards he usually frequented. He did a little updating on his own website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d neglected his Internet community for the last week or two, being preoccupied with a certain lanky blonde. Hooking back in entertained him for a solid two hours before he noticed at least some of the crew across the road were knocking off for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt pulled out, swung to Ford\u0027s side of the road, then leaned out the window. \"Checking the porn sites?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Day and night. How\u0027s it going over there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going. Finished insulating the attic today. Fucking miserable job. Yeah, hey, Spock, how\u0027s it going,\" he added when the dog gave a single, deep-throated, how-about-me bark. \"I\u0027m going home and diving into a cold beer. You coming by for burgers and dogs on the Fourth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t miss it. I\u0027ll be bringing your boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that\u0027s how it was. Nice work, dog. Not you,\" he added, pointing at Spock. \"Don\u0027t know what she sees in you, but I guess she settled since she knows I\u0027m married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that was it. She had to channel her sexual frustration somewhere. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can thank me later.\" With a grin and a toot of the horn, Matt pulled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord poured another glass of tea and traded his laptop for his sketch pad. He wasn\u0027t yet satisfied with his image of his villain. He\u0027d based Devon/ Devino predominantly on his tenth-grade algebra teacher, but turns in his original story line made him think he wanted something slightly more... elegant. Cold, dignified evil played better. He played around with various face types hoping one jumped out and said: Pick me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen none did, he considered a cold beer. Then forgot the work and the beer when Cilla\u0027s truck pulled into his drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew before she got out of the truck. It didn\u0027t matter that her eyes were shielded by sunglasses. The grin said it all. He headed down, several paces behind a happy Spock, as she got out of the truck, then braced himself as she took a running leap into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to take a wild guess. You passed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed!\" Laughing, she bowed back recklessly so he had to shift, brace his legs, or drop her on her head. \"For the first time in my life, I kicked exam ass. I kicked its ass down the street, across county lines and out of the goddamn state. Woo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her arms into the air, then around his neck. \"I am Contractor Girl! Thank you.\" She kissed him hard enough to vibrate his teeth. \"Thank you. Thank you. I was a nervous, quivering mess until I saw that sketch. It just gave me such a high. It really did.\" She kissed him again. \"I\u0027m going to have it framed. It\u0027s the first thing I\u0027m going to hang in my office. My licensed-contractor\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations.\" He thought he\u0027d known just how much the license meant to her. And realized he hadn\u0027t even been close. \"We have to celebrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got that covered. I bought stuff.\" She jumped down, then scooped a thrilled Spock into her arms and covered his big head with kisses. Setting him down, she ran back to her truck. \"French bread, caviar, a roasted chicken with trimmings, stuff, stuff, stuff, complete with little strawberry shortcakes and champagne. It\u0027s all on ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to muscle out a cooler, before he nudged her aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, the traffic was a bitch. I thought I\u0027d never get here. Let\u0027s have a picnic. Let\u0027s have a celebration picnic out back and dance naked on the grass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stuff she\u0027d bought had to weigh a good fifty pounds, he thought, but looking at the way she just shone made it seem weightless. \"It\u0027s like you read my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE DUG UP a blanket and lit a trio of bamboo torcheres to add atmosphere, and discourage bugs. By the time Cilla spread out the feast, half the blanket was covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpock and his bear contented themselves with a ratty towel and a bowl of dog food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caviar, goat cheese, champagne.\" Ford sat on the blanket. \"My usual picnic involves a bucket of chicken, a tub of potato salad and beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take the girl out of Hollywood.\" She began to gather a selection for a plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a blini, for the caviar. A dollop of creme fraiche, a layer of beluga, and... You\u0027ve never had this before?\" she said when she read his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fear is a strong word. I have concerns. Doesn\u0027t caviar come from-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think about it, just eat.\" She held the loaded blini to his lips. \"Open up, you coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced a little but bit in. The combination of flavors-salty, smooth, mildly sweet-hit his taste buds. \"Okay, better than I expected. Where\u0027s yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and fixed another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you plan to set up?\" he asked as they ate. \"Your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\" She washed down caviar with champagne. \"The Little Farm\u0027s a springboard. It gets attention, just because of what it is. The better job I do there, the more chance people see I know what I\u0027m doing. And the subs I\u0027ve hired talk about it, and about me. I need to build on word of mouth. I\u0027ll have to advertise, make it known I\u0027m in business. Use connections. Brian to Brian\u0027s father, for instance. God, this chicken is great. There are two houses within twelve miles up for sale. Serious fixer-uppers that I think are a little overpriced for the area and their conditions. I\u0027m keeping my eye on them. I may make a lowball offer on one of them, see where it goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you finish here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Figure, even if I came to terms with the seller straight off, there\u0027d be thirty to ninety days for settlement. I\u0027d push for the ninety. That\u0027d put me into the fall before I have to start outlaying any cash. And that\u0027s seven, eight months into the Little Farm. I juggle the jobs, and the subs, work out a realistic time frame and budget. Flip the house in, we\u0027ll say, twelve weeks, keeping the price realistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loaded another blini for both of them. \"Greed and not knowing your market\u0027s what can kill a flip just as quick as finding out too late the foundation\u0027s cracked or the house is sitting in a sinkhole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much would you look to make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the house I\u0027m looking at? With the price I\u0027d be willing to pay, the budget I\u0027d project, the resale projection in this market?\" She bit into the blini while she calculated. \"After expenses, I\u0027d look for about forty thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows shot up. \"Forty thousand, in three months?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d hope for forty-five, but thirty-five would do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice.\" She was right about the chicken, too. \"What if I bought the other one? Hired you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Jesus, Ford, you haven\u0027t even seen it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have. And you know what you\u0027re doing-about houses and picnics. I could use an investment, and this has the advantage of a fun factor. Plus, I could be your first client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to at least look at the property, calculate how much you\u0027re willing to invest, how long you can let that investment ride.\" She lifted her champagne glass, gestured with it like a warning. \"And how much you can afford to lose, because real estate and flipping are risks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\u0027s the stock market. Can you handle both houses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a drink. \"Yeah, I could, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try this. Figure out a time when you can go through it with me, and we\u0027ll talk about the potential, the possibilities, your fee and other practical matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Okay. As long as we both understand that once you\u0027ve seen the property and we\u0027ve gone over those projections, and you tell me you\u0027d rather buy a fistful of lottery tickets than that dump, no harm, no foul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood and agreed. Now, with the business portion of tonight\u0027s program out of the way.\" He leaned over to kiss her. \"Do you have any plans for the Fourth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fourth what? Blini?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Cilla. Of July. You know, hot dogs, apple pie, fireworks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. No.\" My God, she thought. It was nearly July. \"Where do people go to watch fireworks around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are a few options. But this is the great state of Virginia. We set off our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ve seen the signs. You all are crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be that as it may, Matt\u0027s having a cookout. It\u0027s a short walk from his place to the park where the Roritan band plays Sousa marches, there\u0027s the world-famous pie-eating contest, won four years running by Big John Porter, and other various slices of Americana before the fireworks display. Wanna be my date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would.\" She leaned over the picnic debris, linked her arms around his neck. \"Ford?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I eat another bite of anything, I\u0027m going to be sick. So...\" She leaped up, grabbed his hands. \"Let\u0027s dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About that. My plans were to lie here like a dissipated Roman soldier and watch you dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t. Up, up, up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just one problem. I don\u0027t dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody dances. Even Spock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Well, yes, he does,\" Ford admitted as Spock got up to demonstrate. \"I don\u0027t. Did you ever catch Seinfeld? The TV deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see the one where Elaine\u0027s at this office party, and to get people up to dance, she starts it off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah.\" The scene popped straight into her mind, made her laugh. \"That was bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I make Elaine look like Jennifer Lopez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be that bad. I refuse to believe it. Come on, show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose gold-rimmed eyes showed actual pain. \"If I show you, you\u0027ll never have sex with me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely false. Show me your moves, Sawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no moves in this arena.\" But with a heavy sigh, he rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little boogie,\" she suggested. She moved her hips, her shoulders, her feet. Obviously, to Ford\u0027s mind, to some well-oiled internal engine. Clutching the bear between his paws, Spock gurgled his approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked for it,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved, and could swear he heard rusty gears with mismatched teeth grind and shriek. He looked like the Tin Man of Oz, before the oil can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s not... Okay, that\u0027s really bad.\" She struggled to swallow a snort of laughter, but didn\u0027t quite succeed. The disgusted look he shot her had her holding up her hands and stepping quickly to him. \"Wait, wait. Sorry. I can teach you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Spock snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others have tried; all have failed. I have no rhythm. I am rhythmically impaired. I\u0027ve learned to live with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bull. Anyone who has your kind of moves horizontally can have them vertically. Here.\" She took his hands, set them on her hips, then put hers on his. \"It starts here. This isn\u0027t a structured sort of thing, like a waltz or quickstep. It\u0027s just moving. A little hip action. No, unlock your knees, it\u0027s not a goose step, either. Just left, right, left. Shift your weight to the left, not just your hip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look and feel like a spastic robot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t.\" She shot Spock a warning glance, and the dog turned his head away. \"Relax. Now, keep the hips going, but put your hands on my shoulders. That\u0027s it. Feel my shoulders, just a little up and down. Feel that, let that go up your arms, into your shoulders. Just up and down. Don\u0027t stiffen up, keep those knees loose. There you go, there you are. You\u0027re dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\" She put her hands on his shoulders, then slid them down his arms until they held hands. \"And now you\u0027re dancing with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m standing like an idiot in one spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll worry about the feet later. We\u0027re starting slow, and smooth. It would even be sexy if you took that pained expression off your face. Don\u0027t stop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did a quick inward spin so her back pressed into him, and lifted an arm to stroke it down his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, if this is dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, she spun back again so they were front to front. \"Sway. A little more.\" She wrapped her arms around his neck, lifted her lips to a breath from his. \"Nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the distance, sliding slowly into the kiss while his hands ran down her back to her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feels like dancing to me,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe surfaced to see he was facing in the opposite direction, and several feet away from where they\u0027d started. \"How\u0027d that happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let it happen. You stopped thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I can dance, as long as it\u0027s with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one more thing.\" She danced back with a provocative rock of hips, and began unbuttoning her shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe the celebration called for naked dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced in the direction of his closest neighbors. Dusk had fallen, but torches tossed out light. He glanced down at his dog, who sat, head cocked, obviously fascinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should move that event inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, and her blouse slid down with the movement of her shoulders. \"In the grass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Mrs. Berkowitz-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t spy on her neighbor, even if she could see through that big black walnut tree.\" Cilla unhooked her pants, kicked off her shoes, which Spock retrieved and carried territorially to his ratty towel. \"And when we\u0027ve finished dancing naked, there\u0027s something else I\u0027m going to do on the grass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to give you the ride of your life.\" She stepped out of her pants, continued to sway, turn as she ran her hands over her own body, marginally covered now in two tiny white swatches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord forgot the dog, the shoes, the neighbors. He watched, all of the blood draining out of his head as she flicked open the front hook, opened her bra inch by delicious inch. The torchlight glimmered gold over her skin, danced in her eyes like sun on a pure blue sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bra floated to the ground, she ran a fingertip under, just under the low-riding waist of her panties. \"You\u0027re still dressed. Don\u0027t you want to dance with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Oh yeah. Can I just say something first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed her fingers down her breasts, smiled at him. \"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two things, actually. Oh Christ,\" he managed when she lifted her hair, let it fall over those glowing shoulders. \"You\u0027re the most beautiful thing I\u0027ve ever seen. And at this moment? I\u0027m the luckiest man in the known universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re about to get luckier.\" Tossing her hair back, she started toward him. She pressed her naked body to his. \"Now, dance with me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-18.html","bookId":2414,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM"}
