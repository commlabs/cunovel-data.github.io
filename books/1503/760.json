(1)","content":"\u003cp\u003eThis thirty-seventh vortex slowly rose up from Zhou Weiqing’s DanTian, almost like it was floating up through the air.\u0026nbsp;This was very slow, and it was only rising because Zhou Weiqing’s body had accumulated an even more massive amount of Astral Saint Energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the other vortexes within Zhou Weiqing’s body began to transform as well.\u0026nbsp;They originally had been spinning at a very fast pace.\u0026nbsp;Now, not only did they begin to absorb energies more slowly, the rotation speed itself became slower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing himself could sense as though his body was filled with quicksilver, dense and highly sticky quicksilver, which was slowly spinning.\u0026nbsp;Even if he wanted to stop, he wouldn’t be able to.\u0026nbsp;His body was like a statue that had become completely solidified inside.\u0026nbsp;His blood flow had already slowed down to an incredibly low rate.\u0026nbsp;If Shangguan Bing’er put her fingers beneath his nose, she would find to her amazement that Zhou Weiqing had completely stopped breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u0026nbsp;He wasn’t breathing, but this didn’t mean Zhou Weiqing was dead.\u0026nbsp;He was in a very marvelous state which was filled with opportunity and danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to it only be possible to train to the thirty-sixth stage of the Immortal Deity Technique, Zhou Weiqing hadn’t had any suitable cultivation techniques for him to train in after he entered the nine-Jeweled stage.\u0026nbsp;As a result, he was constantly improving his own Saint Energy.\u0026nbsp;What was happening right now was something he had never even heard of.\u0026nbsp;He had no idea what was going on, and could only continue according to his imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, even if he wanted to stop he couldn’t.\u0026nbsp;A Saint Core.\u0026nbsp;Was he really about to consolidate a Saint Core Nucleus?\u0026nbsp;Although Zhou Weiqing wasn’t able to move his body, his head was blazing with flames.\u0026nbsp;Six days ago, his Saint Energy had already broken through to the thirty-ninth stage.\u0026nbsp;He had spent five days devouring energy, resulting in his Saint Energy being fully converted into Astral Saint Energy, which also took a full day.\u0026nbsp;After that, he hadn’t seemed to make any further breakthroughs at all.\u0026nbsp;He had no idea how his Saint Core Nucleus would be consolidated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be remembered that he had Devoured the full Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly God-level Heavenly Beast!\u0026nbsp;However, he still wasn’t able to break through to become a Heavenly King.\u0026nbsp;One could imagine how harder the breakthrough requirements were for Saint Energy than any other Attributes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to what the great dragon Hui Yao believed, this time Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill should’ve at least allowed him to rise to the early Heavenly Emperor level.\u0026nbsp;However, it now looked as though it would be good if he could even rise to the Heavenly King level.\u0026nbsp;The only thing remaining of that Terror Sea Dragon was its final core essence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the energy within the core essence was the purest of all, there just wasn’t enough of it.\u0026nbsp;It was hard to say if it would be enough to help Zhou Weiqing break through to the Heavenly King stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body continued to climb upwards.\u0026nbsp;Although the process was slow, it was still agonizing to his body, as his meridians were full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bones and his meridians were all straining in pain due to being completely full.\u0026nbsp;As for the thirty-seventh vortex, it had already risen to his chest as well.\u0026nbsp;As it did so, it halted its rise and began to continue spinning once more.\u0026nbsp;This time, however, it didn’t seem to be interested in drawing in anything else.\u0026nbsp;And yet, Zhou Weiqing had a very special feeling about it as it continued to slowly spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an unclear, unspeakable level.\u0026nbsp;When the vortex in front of his chest began to spin, he vaguely gained insight into a certain something.\u0026nbsp;In that instant, everything around him seemed to undergo an utterly earth-shattering transformation.\u0026nbsp;It was as though he wasn’t even in the Boundless Mainland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sensory world of his mind had become completely dark, but within the darkness there were countless specks of light.\u0026nbsp;These specks of light slowly began to gather around him, spinning and forming a vortex around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore and more of the light appeared, slowly coming together into a series of long ribbons.\u0026nbsp;As for Zhou Weiqing himself, his light around his consciousness began to grow stronger and stronger, as though transforming into a giant astral cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had never studied astronomy before, and he had no clue what this state was.\u0026nbsp;He just had the vague feeling that aside from the atmospheric energies, there was another sort of energy that came from an incomparably distant world which was pouring into his body.\u0026nbsp;What was this energy?\u0026nbsp;It seemed to come from the skies.\u0026nbsp;This was the energy of the Big Dipper constellation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s emotions were currently quite stable.\u0026nbsp;Although he didn’t know what was going on, upon entering this marvelous state all of his earlier pain vanished.\u0026nbsp;The only thing left in his heart was enlightenment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs more of those light ribbons accumulated, the entire astral cloud continued to spin at a pace which was neither fast nor slow.\u0026nbsp;The astral cloud itself didn’t rise upwards; in fact, it actually began to shrink inwards.\u0026nbsp;During this process, the ribbons of light began to gather around the larger cloud of astral light, causing it to grow brighter and brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing didn’t know that when he had entered this state, the people outside were terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost the very first thing he had done was to fully absorb all the final core essence of the Terror Sea Dragon.\u0026nbsp;Then, his body suddenly unleashed an incomparably dazzling silver light.\u0026nbsp;When this light appeared, an enormous gray image actually descended from the heavens and entered Zhou Weiqing’s body.\u0026nbsp;But, even as it merged it wasn’t able to change the silver light which was glowing across his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if the Terror Sea Dragon didn’t have Heavenly Energy, its body remained at the Heavenly God level.\u0026nbsp;However, just as Zhou Weiqing’s body began to emanate a strong aura of starlight, the dragon’s great corpse began to tremble nonstop.\u0026nbsp;It was as though its flesh and blood had also transformed into energy and had been swallowed away by Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;In the next instant, the two great dragons latched onto the Terror Sea Dragon and instantly reduced the body to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, the specks of light around Zhou Weiqing’s body suddenly became incomparably tough.\u0026nbsp;They began to rotate rapidly, exploding with a terrifying aura was simply indescribable.\u0026nbsp;Hui Yao’s first reaction was to draw Shangguan Bing’er into its own body, while its wife fled far away from Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t incapable of resisting this energy, but if it tried to resist by force it could end up hurting Zhou Weiqing. \u003cem\u003eWhat type of energy is this?\u003c/em\u003e A sense of indescribable awe appeared within Hui Yao and Duo Si’s minds. They had no idea what level Zhou Weiqing had just reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next instant, something even more stunning occurred.\u0026nbsp;Originally, the two great dragons had completely controlled the weather in this area, ensuring that nothing disturbed Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation.\u0026nbsp;However, the heavens suddenly changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright day suddenly transformed into night, while the skies became incomparably translucent.\u0026nbsp;Not a single cloud could be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were able to clearly see that every single star within the skies was shining with radiant light.\u0026nbsp;As for Zhou Weiqing, he floated there like the stars above the waters.\u0026nbsp;The lustrous light emanating from him actually resonated with the astral light in the skies, and a few dim strands of astral light actually gathered within his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even the long-lived dragons held any memories of such a strange phenomenon, despite their ancient histories.\u0026nbsp;That sense of pressure vanished, but the two great dragons could no longer sense Zhou Weiqing either.\u0026nbsp;It was as though he had completely fused into the stars of the night sky and was no longer a mere human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er had been covering her lips this entire time, shocked.\u0026nbsp;She was a human, and her senses were different from those of the two great dragons.\u0026nbsp;In this instant, she suddenly felt as though her Little Fatty was no longer on the same level of existence as her.\u0026nbsp;This wasn’t something which came from a disparity of power, it came from an indescribable intrinsic quality he now possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe astral light emanating from Zhou Weiqing grew even denser and thicker, and it coiled around him faster and faster.\u0026nbsp;The ribbons of light sped up to an inconceivable amount, with all of the light suddenly vanishing within Zhou Weiqing’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next instant, a burst of terrifyingly bright light which couldn’t be stared at blasted out from Zhou Weiqing’s body.\u0026nbsp;This light stretched out for thousands of kilometers, and in that instant all of the stars in the skies turned dim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mighty light didn’t have a powerful aura to it, but even so, the two great dragons simultaneously could sense a spiritual pressure pushing them down into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eW-what type of power is this?!\u003c/em\u003e The two great dragons were completely stunned. They had no idea what Zhou Weiqing was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, not even Zhou Weiqing himself knew what he was doing.\u0026nbsp;He had the feeling that all of the astral light had merged into his body, which seemed to have immediately exploded.\u0026nbsp;His thoughts and senses sped up to an incredible rate, but the only thing he could sense was that boundless astral light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t sense any energy, but Zhou Weiqing realized that almost everything in the starry skies seemed willing to follow his lead.\u0026nbsp;This was an extremely strange feeling.\u0026nbsp;In that instant, Zhou Weiqing discovered to his astonishment that his Saint Energy had completely disappeared.\u0026nbsp;Right.\u0026nbsp;All of the Astral Saint Energy had completely vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he noticed this, he finally sensed that his thoughts had returned to his own body.\u0026nbsp;The Astral Saint Energy had vanished, but something else had appeared within his body.\u0026nbsp;It was a faint golden pearl that was perfectly smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis pearl hovered within his chest, and the strangest thing about it was that it was actually surrounded by slender little ribbons of light that circulated around it.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing scanned himself and instantly realized that he seemed to have undergone an earthshaking change.\u0026nbsp;His body no longer seemed to exist, while everything within the world was available for him to command, including the endless starry night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI-is this my Saint Core Nucleus?\u003c/em\u003e Zhou Weiqing felt incomparably stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside his body, the night sky finally turned back into day.\u0026nbsp;Everything quickly went back to normal… but the great dragon Hui Yao couldn’t help but let out an astonished cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could cause a Heavenly God-level great dragon, especially one who was a progeny of the Dragon Emperors, call out in shock?\u0026nbsp;One could imagine how truly stunning this scene was!\u0026nbsp;“Forty-nine days?\u0026nbsp;It was actually forty-nine days?!”\u0026nbsp;Hui Yao stared dazed as it mumbled to itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled, Duo Si asked, “What do you mean, forty-nine days?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-257-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-258-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-258-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
