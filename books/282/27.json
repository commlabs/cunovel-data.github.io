{"id":8616,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. SERVING A TYRANT.","content":"\u0026nbsp;If Paul was prejudiced against the book-keeper thus early, Mr. Manson was not prepossessed in his favor. He would have been prejudiced against any boy who was selected to fill the place he designed for his nephew, but besides this there was an indefinable something in Paul\u0027s air and manner that led him to anticipate difficulty in maintaining his authority. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall have trouble with that boy, I\u0027m thinking,\" he said to himself, with a vicious stab of the pen in the unoffending paper before him. \"Well, that will be bad for him, I reckon. He looks like a mighty independent young vagabond. I shall have to take him in training.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The duties of Paul\u0027s new place were not difficult to learn. He didn\u0027t need to be shown the way to the post-office, or bank, and he was as well acquainted with the streets and localities of Chicago as any boy had occasion to be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So when the day was over, he bade a friendly good-night to John Graves with the remark:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 199]\"I guess I can get along by myself now, John, but I hope to see you sometimes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-night, Paul. I hope you will get along with the book-keeper.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will try to,\" answered Paul. \"That is, I will do all I can reasonably be expected to, but I shall not allow him to run over me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027ll make the attempt, you may be sure of that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way, John, do you mind telling me how much pay you have received—how much a week, I mean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Four dollars a week for the first six months. Then I was promoted to five, though the book-keeper tried hard to prevent it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you had been his nephew it would have been different.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, he would have given Julius five dollars, perhaps six, to start with.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very likely.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul was glad John did not ask him how much he was to receive, as it would have been difficult to explain why he should be so favored. In fact, John supposed no bargain had been made, and that Paul had questioned him in order to ascertain what he was himself likely to be paid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul presented himself the next morning at the[Pg 200] office at the usual hour, which he had been told was eight o\u0027clock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-morning, sir!\" he said to the book-keeper, who had just arrived.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Humph, you\u0027re late!\" said Manson, sourly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then a public clock struck eight, and the strokes were audible to both.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not by that clock, Mr. Manson,\" said Paul, significantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Humph! that clock\u0027s always slow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul did not think it necessary to answer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, go to work! Don\u0027t stand idling there!\" said Manson, sharply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir, if you will let me know what to do,\" said Paul, not in the least nervous.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dust off my desk, and be quick about it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul did as he was directed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now go to the post-office. Wait, here is the key to our box.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul went and returned immediately, making unusually good time, but it is easy for an unreasonable man to find fault, if he has fully made up his mind to do so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What made you so long?\" demanded the book-keeper, irascibly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul was provoked, and had no hesitation in showing his sense of the book-keeper\u0027s unreasonableness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 201]\"Because I haven\u0027t wings, or seven league boots,\" he answered, coolly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do you dare speak thus to me?\" demanded Manson, in a rage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because, sir, neither you nor any one else can make better time without running.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As Paul said this, he looked Mr. Manson in the eye, and Manson saw that the boy did not mean to be imposed upon. But he did not propose to relinquish his habit of finding fault readily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s gammon!\" he said; \"I know what boys are like. They all waste time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t,\" answered Paul, briefly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t be impudent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, sir, don\u0027t be unreasonable.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have a good mind to discharge you on the spot,\" said the book-keeper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As you please, sir. If Mr. Bradford sustains you, I shall make no request to remain.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Manson felt that he had not come out of the controversy best. Paul exhibited a coolness and composure that surprised and annoyed him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He won\u0027t stay here long, if I can help it,\" he said to himself. \"Why, he actually defies me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless, Paul\u0027s quiet resolution made him more wary in his dealings with Paul, as he did not like to run the risk of defeat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 202]\"You can take this note to Mr. Bradford,\" he said, an hour later.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He would have preferred to send some one else, for he did not care that Paul should have an opportunity of getting into the good graces of his employer; but he had no choice. This was the boy\u0027s duty, and no one else could be spared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The note related to business on which Mr. Bradford would expect to be consulted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Take that,\" he said, \"and come back some time to-day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall come back as soon as Mr. Bradford releases me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Take care you do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All this was very annoying, and, indeed, insulting, but Paul was judicious, and, while resisting aggression and injustice, knew that he could not make Mr. Manson civil or polite.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Arrived at the house of Mr. Bradford, Paul was shown into the presence of the manufacturer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-morning, Paul!\" said Mr. Bradford, pleasantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-morning, sir. I have come with a note from Mr. Manson.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Bradford took it and read it quickly. He took out a pencil and wrote at the bottom a couple of lines.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 203]\"That is my answer,\" he said, returning it to Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do you like Mr. Manson?\" asked the manufacturer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not very well, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose he does not appear to like you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir; it is very clear he does not.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul stopped there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you any complaints to make?\" asked Mr. Bradford.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir; I don\u0027t care to say anything; but I would like to ask you a favor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it, Paul?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If Mr. Manson makes any complaints against me, will you give me an opportunity to defend myself?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly I will. Do you apprehend that he will complain of you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am pretty sure he will.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He seems determined to find fault with me. However, I shall not be the first to complain. I propose to do my duty faithfully, and will bear his scolding as well as I can. If I suit you, sir, I shall be satisfied. I don\u0027t expect to suit Mr. Manson.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well said, Paul. I won\u0027t inquire into your relations with the book-keeper, but if he complains of[Pg 204] you, you may rest assured that I will give you a chance to defend yourself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, sir; that is all I ask.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul returned to the office, and when, as he expected, Mr. Manson charged him with loitering on the way, he heard him with a cool contempt, which angered the book-keeper more than spoken words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really, this is the most impertinent boy we ever had in the office. He does not seem to mind me any more than if I was a porter.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Accustomed to have boys quail before him, he was provoked at the coolness with which Paul bore his taunts and reproaches, and he felt all the more resolved either to get him dismissed, or to make him anxious to resign.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among other things, he was accustomed to employ the office-boy to run on his private errands, though, of course, wholly unauthorized to do so, and he expected to employ Paul in the same manner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n About three o\u0027clock he summoned Paul, and said to him:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may go to my room, No. 47 H—— street, and ask my landlady to give you a bundle of dirty clothes, which you will carry to the laundry, No. 18 M—— street.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul looked at him in astonishment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are the clothes Mr. Bradford\u0027s?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 205]\"No, you little fool, they are mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, sir, I must decline to take them. I am in Mr. Bradford\u0027s employ, not yours.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you decline to do as I bid you?\" gasped Manson, at white heat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir. I am not employed to do any such work.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll repent this!\" exclaimed the book-keeper, mortified and incensed. \"It seems you defy my authority.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir; I shall do whatever you have a right to demand of me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll have you out of this office before the end of the week. See if I don\u0027t.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul walked away, not appearing in the least terrified by this threat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83098.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:39 AM"}
