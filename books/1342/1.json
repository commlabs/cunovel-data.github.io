There was a youth behind the Foxenby posts with a muddy mark on the side of his face, and he at least knew no goal had been scored.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The first shot of the match had flashed by the upright—on the wrong side of it for St. Cuthbert\u0027s, on the right side of it for Foxenby, whose sigh of heart-felt relief was audible when their rivals\u0027 untimely cheers had died down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A narrow squeak, old man!\" said Dick Forge, the captain of the Foxenby team, to Broome, the inside-left, selected from Holbeck\u0027s House.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Rather!\" answered Broome. \"It quite turned my heart over.

By calling \"heads\" as the referee span a coin in the air, when it would have been much nicer had he said \"tails \", he had passed the luck of the toss to the rival captain, who thankfully grabbed the chance of placing a spanking sea-breeze at the back of his team.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hard lines indeed, you Foxenby fellows, to lose the toss in a wind like this, and on such a very important day. For you have worked your way through to the final tie of the County Schools\u0027 Cup against teams of stronger build, only to meet, in the last match, eleven sturdy youths who outweigh you almost man for man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forge and Lyon alone can be said to be up to the average bulk of your opponents. Ennis, your trusty goalkeeper, is certainly tall, but see how thin he looks! Almost like a third goalpost, you might say.

They can\u0027t even cross the half-way line,\" snorted the champion of St. Cuthbert\u0027s, contemptuously. \"See how we\u0027re peppering your goalie all the time. Play up, Saints! Bang \u0027em in, boys! Oo—ooo, a goal—no, hang it, only a corner!

Already there were many ominous smudges of mud on the newly-whitewashed goalposts and crossbar, and a series of finely-placed corner-kicks had only been hustled away by what seemed to be desperate scrimmages of the Rugby order, with the luck on Foxenby\u0027s side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The impartial crowd of Walsbridge townspeople, on whose ground the final tie was being played, had read wonderful accounts of the Cuthbertians\u0027 rock-like defence—it delighted them to see that these hefty youths knew also the straight route to an opponent\u0027s goal. Therefore, they began by wishing Ennis, the goalkeeper of the \"Foxes\", good luck, and plenty of hard work!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They flocked behind his goal, cheering him again and again as he flung himself backwards and forwards to fist away corking shots, some of which he probably knew very little about, though it just happened that his long body was always in the way. The better the goal-keeper, the more good fortune he enjoys as a rule. Forwards seem somehow magnetized into shooting where he is.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How about that hatful of goals your team were going to score?\" Robin Arkness wanted to know, after twenty minutes of this sort of thing. \"Rather overlooked the fact that our side had a goalkeeper, didn\u0027t you, Cuthbert kid?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He kept that last one out by a sheer fluke,\" grumbled the young Cuthbertian. \"See, there he goes again, bobbing the ball away with his eyes shut.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How unkind of him!\" said Robin, in mock indignation. \"Ennis, you\u0027re a cad, you know, not letting the nice little Saints add to their twenty-three goals. Stand aside, you naughty man, while they drive holes through the net!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But older heads than Robin\u0027s were being shaken over the sore straits in which Foxenby found themselves so early in the game. Luke Harwood, the prefect of Holbeck\u0027s House, and editor of the school magazine, seemed so concerned about it that he voiced his fears to Roger Cayton, prefect of Rooke\u0027s House, whose close personal friendship with the captain of the team made him doubly anxious about the way things were going.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ennis is marvellous,\" said Luke, \"but one-man shows don\u0027t win football matches. Our halves and forwards can\u0027t even raise a gallop.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s no surprise, seeing that you and I have to hold our caps on in the breeze.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Granted, Cayton. Still, I wouldn\u0027t leave all the donkey-work to Ennis and Lyon if I were captain. I\u0027d fall back and help.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you were captain, yes. But Forge has different ideas. Let\u0027s give him credit for knowing more about football than a spectator can.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a sting in this comment, which Luke Harwood did not fail to observe. As editor of the Foxonian he was unapproachably the school\u0027s best pupil, and so obviously the Head\u0027s favourite boy that he was known throughout both houses as \"Old Wykeham\u0027s Pet Fox\". But as a footballer he was \"only middling\", and to-day the selection committee had quietly passed him over. The pill was a bitter one, and Roger\u0027s comment made it still harder to swallow, but all he did was to whistle softly and smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like to know the name of the artist who decked Fluffy Jim, the village idiot, in those stripes of coloured paper,\" continued Roger Cayton. \"Club colours, of course, blue and white stripes. Still, football enthusiasm may be carried too far, and such tomfoolery makes me sick. What goats the St. Cuthbert\u0027s fellows will think us!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pray don\u0027t take our little joke too seriously, Cayton,\" said Luke, with a pleasant laugh. \"Where\u0027s the big league club that doesn\u0027t cart its mascot around with it on cup days? Fluffy Jim may bring us luck and some second-half goals.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, to be sure,\" snapped Roger. \"Particularly as St. Cuthbert\u0027s have come through to the final with a clean goal-sheet. They\u0027re the sort of chaps who would be scared out of their form by a guy in coloured paper, no doubt.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harwood gave a resigned shrug of his shoulders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Funny, isn\u0027t it, how the best-laid schemes \u0027gang aft agley\u0027?\" he commented. \"Some of us thought that the sight of a mascot in gala garb would serve to keep the footballing Foxes in good-humour throughout the game.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s cheap and nasty,\" said Roger Cayton, not without pluck, considering that Luke Harwood could have made a broken reed of him in physical combat. \"Weakness of intellect is a sorry enough thing in itself. A coloured advertisement of it is worse.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Composed in manner always, seldom without an engaging smile, Harwood did not let this half-challenge pass unnoticed. There was a gleam in his eyes which even short-sighted Roger saw.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Between these two quick-witted boys existed an unspoken feud, founded on Harwood\u0027s refusal to print in the Foxonian the contributions which Roger persisted in sending. Doubtless Harwood felt that there was scarcely room in the school magazine for two such literary stars as he and Roger to shine at the same time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Harwood, calmly, \"sorry if my cronies and I have given offence. Our consolation must be that Fluffy Jim is having the happiest day of his life. And you fellows may yet come to hail him as a luck-bringer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Superstitious piffle, Harwood,\" Roger grunted, He and Luke then drifted casually, apart. Neither desired to spoil a good football match by bearing each other company any longer. Oil and vinegar, these two!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have a rotten grain of suspicion in my nature, doubtless,\" thought Roger. \"Still, Forge is captain of the football team and captain of the school—Luke Harwood would like to be both, and is neither. He knows Dick is strung on wires, and how small a thing upsets him on big occasions. This fool idea, then, of dressing the village idiot like a circus clown—is there method in his madness? Is there a secret hope that it will put Dick off his game?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Left to himself, the half-witted youth known as \"Fluffy Jim\" was as quiet as an old sheep. Now, inspired by someone behind the goal, he used his booming voice to shout out repeatedly, in the dialect of the district:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Coom back an\u0027 keep \u0027em oot—coom back, coom back, afo?r they sco?ar!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Others—and some who should have known better—took up the cry; but Fluffy Jim\u0027s voice rose above the rest, just as his paper costume was the most conspicuous thing on the field.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mascot, indeed!\" thought Dick Forge bitterly. \"His ridiculous rig-out gets on my nerves, and now his voice is doing ditto. Some kind friend in Holbeck\u0027s House is pulling the strings, I suspect.

In imagination they saw Ennis beaten by every fresh shot which the determined St. Cuthbert\u0027s team fired at the goal, and it certainly seemed impossible that the tall, thin youth, who had already done wonders, could hold the fort much longer. But Dick Forge refused to be \"rattled\".\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t get the wind up, chaps,\" he urged. \"If I\u0027m injured and carried off the field, you can pack the goal then.

How very much easier it would have been to beat the lanky Ennis with an uninterrupted shot, than when Lyon was circling round him like an eagle defending its nest!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lyon was too bad—Lyon had handled purposely, and he ought to have owned up to it, said the mortified Cuthbertians.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Lyon the Silent set his teeth and said nothing.

Each \"potted\" Ennis from every angle, allowing him no rest. The cross-bar rattled and creaked like the swinging sign-board of a tavern, and corner-kicks seemed almost as plentiful as roadside blackberries. But between the posts that aggravating ball simply would not go.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Three more minutes, Foxenby—kick away, kick away!\" yelled Robin Arkness and his frenzied chums.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s positively sickening,\" said the young Cuthbertian, working his shoulders about in sheer agony of suspense. \"Your chaps have had chunks of luck thrown at \u0027em.

Hey, hooray! Forge is on the ball—Forge is tivying off to the other end! Oh, bother! The wind\u0027s beaten him—the ball\u0027s in touch. Never mind—we\u0027re across the half-way line.

Small wonder that the Foxenby team left the playing pitch with easier minds, and that the Junior Foxes grabbed one another frantically and waltzed and pirouetted round and round the ropes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76159.html","bookId":1342,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:29:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:29:09 AM"}
