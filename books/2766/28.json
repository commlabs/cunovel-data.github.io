{"id":85880,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\u003cp\u003eMy heart is racing wildly, because I know it\u0027s just a matter of time until they realize I\u0027ve got boobs and not muscular pecs. While my boyfriend is slinking around the other side in his undies, with black paint on his body (my artwork, thanks to the small container of face paint he had in his vest) and his own paintball gun, I\u0027m the decoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi gave me specific instructions to surrender so I don\u0027t get hit. They won\u0027t fire unless fired upon. Although I know and they know that Avi would never go down without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run from one rock to another just like Avi told me to. (Imagine one of those ducks going back and forth in a carnival shooting game.) I\u0027m still a bit shocked he agreed to my plan, but it just goes to show that a great leader like Avi knows how to listen as well as lead. I admit it took a little coaxing from me. At first he wasn\u0027t into letting me become the target. But when I assured him I\u0027d be okay, and that we were in this together, he finally relented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to count to ten and then hold my hands over my head to surrender. But as two of the opposing team members move closer to me, cornering me on both sides, I start to panic. They\u0027re too far away to make out that it\u0027s me, but I desperately want Avi to have time to rescue the hostages from his squad and fix this botched exercise. I have to help him, even if it means opening fire to kill the enemy. I wouldn\u0027t shoot anyone in real life, because even after all of this training, I\u0027m still totally for peace and happiness and rainbows and sushi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is paintball. And I\u0027m taking no prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my gun on auto and shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop! Pop! Pop! Pop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle paint balls are flying ferociously out of my gun. Since it\u0027s dark, I have no clue what I\u0027m shooting, and hope I\u0027m hitting at least some part of the enemy squad. I\u0027m Rambo and GI Jane all wrapped into one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hard whacks my back and thigh. \"Ouch!\" I scream. \"That hurt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at my thigh and realize I\u0027ve been hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy a paintball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m officially dead. I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone should try living in the gray areas of life at least once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll have you know I took down two guys before I was paintballed to death. My idea actually worked. During the shootout, Avi was able to rescue Udi and Ori. They captured the last guy on the other team and we were victorious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news (besides the paintball-sized welts I have on my thigh and stomach) is that I\u0027m waiting in a large military tent, with Avi sitting on the chair next to me, about to be debriefed on how I got into the war games in the first place. At least they let us change back into our own clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who\u0027s in charge of the war games isn\u0027t Sergeant B-S. It\u0027s this other guy, with a bunch of stripes on the side of his sleeve, who happens to be sitting at a table opposite us in the tent. He\u0027s dark-skinned, bald, and does not look happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know his rank, but he\u0027s high up there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering I\u0027m zero rank, I can\u0027t be demoted. But Avi can. And even though he personally had nothing to do with me wandering into the war games, he ended up being an accomplice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Sergeant B-S files into the tent, his stern eyes focus on me. This is not good. It\u0027s the same look my dad gave me when he found out I\u0027d taken his credit card and signed him up for an online Jewish dating service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get here?\" he asks me. The bald guy with the high rank stands next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and will myself to stay strong and positive. With Avi beside me, I get an inner strength. \"I kind of wandered away from our campsite to find a place to relieve myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that telling them the entire truth--that I also wanted to say goodbye to Avi--wouldn\u0027t go over too well. I decide to play the confused American girl. I know, I know, I\u0027m not doing my country any favors by playing dumb. But my friend Kayleigh from Georgia totally uses her southern accent to get what she wants. And this girl Renee at my school--she\u0027s super-smart and super-blond-- plays the dumb blond so that guys give her attention and come to her rescue even if she doesn\u0027t need rescuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho says I can\u0027t play the game for my and Avi\u0027s benefit? They don\u0027t call it war games for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got lost,\" I lie. \"So I followed noises, hoping it would lead me back to the campsite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant B-S huffs at my explanation and definitely looks skeptical. \"Gefen,\" he says, staring solidly at Avi. \"Why did she have a paintball gun in her possession?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi quickly glances at me, then looks at the sergeant and the bald guy. \"After I found her wandering on the rocks, and realized I couldn\u0027t take her back without revealing my location to the enemy when we were already down by two men, I recruited her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recruited her? Instead of protected her? She\u0027s a civilian. That was bad judgment, Gefen,\" the bald guy pipes in. \"What right did you have to recruit her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was team leader. I made the decision based on my professional opinion of her abilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bald guy crosses his arms over his chest. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my hand tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he barks at me, just as the rest of Avi\u0027s squad enters the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, I might not be Israeli, but my father is. He was a commando. And my boyfriend is a Sayeret Tzefa trainee. I\u0027m trained in Krav Maga and I\u0027ve just spent time in boot camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a good soldier,\" Nimrod says from behind Sergeant B-S. \"If it weren\u0027t for her being a decoy, our squad would have lost. Avi made the right decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea Ze nachon--it\u0027s true,\" Ori says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimrod shrugs. \"It was quick thinking on Avi\u0027s part. And Amy\u0027s, too. Protecting someone unarmed would have put him at a further disadvantage, so he gave her the means to protect herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant B-S turns to Avis current superior. \"Commander, what\u0027s your assessment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bald commander stares at Avi and me. \"I think Gefen should be reprimanded for not following procedure. And commended for his quick thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that mean he\u0027s not in trouble?\" I ask hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That means he gets the pleasure of running extra kilometers every day for the next week,\" the commander says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think you\u0027re free and clear of this mess, Ms. Nelson-Barak,\" Sergeant B-S tells me. \"I\u0027m thinking of assigning you permanent kitchen duty until you leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh. Not again. Picking bees out of jam, brushing ants off bread. Amy, look on the bright side, I tell myself. Well, at least I\u0027m not going to be eating any more Loof. Next to Loof, the food back on base is an absolute delicacy. How\u0027s that for positivity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move out, everyone,\" Sergeant B-S calls out. \"You\u0027ve got a few hours to sleep before wakeup.\" He then tells me that Liron is waiting for us in a military jeep to drive us back to the campsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at Avi, and a wave of sadness washes over me. What if I don\u0027t see him for another year?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you five minutes, Gefen.\" Sergeant B-S points to Nimrod. \"Stay here as chaperone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimrod nods, then when everyone leaves the tent besides the three of us, Nimrod turns around and gives us what little privacy he can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi takes me in his arms and holds me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lump forms in my throat and tears well in my eyes. I can\u0027t keep the first tear from falling. Avi holds my face in his hands and swipes the tear away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her you love her already,\" Nimrod says, his back still to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She already knows I do,\" Avi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girls like to be told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you know?\" Avi shoots back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimrod shrugs. \"I don\u0027t. I\u0027m guessing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi leans down and kisses me, his lips warm and gentle. I pull him closer, not wanting to let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nimrod coughs out a one-minute warning, Avi pulls back. We\u0027re both breathless. \"Be good and stay out of trouble,\" he tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me you\u0027re talking to, Avi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles. \"Yeah, I know. Forget what I said. Be spontaneous. It\u0027s what makes you special. I love that about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a new motto in life. Wanna know what it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything in the end is going to be sababa. You and me, my mom\u0027s new baby, my dad and Maria... even Jessica and Tarik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to know my new motto, Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gefen, I hate to break up this sababa party,\" Nimrod says. \"But time\u0027s up. Your girlfriend\u0027s got to go.\" He puts his hands up in mock surrender. \"Sergeant\u0027s orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go,\" Avi whispers in my ear. \"Before I\u0027m tempted to go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I say, as Sergeant B-S bellows my name and orders me out of the tent. \"What\u0027s your motto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi winks at me. \"Look in your pockets when you get back tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hop in the back of the jeep Liron is driving. Sergeant B-S is sitting in the front seat next to her. I\u0027m frantically searching for whatever Avi left for me in one of my pockets. I reach in and pull out a piece of crumpled paper. When I open it, Avi\u0027s Sayeret Tzefa medallion drops into my hand. I remember the words he said were etched on it: Respect, Strength, and Honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the campground, I take my headlight under my sleeping bag and examine the medallion. The paper the medallion was wrapped in has handwritten words on it: it\u0027s a note from Avi. Tears come to my eyes as I read the words over and over...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll always hold a part of me, Amy, whether we\u0027re together or not. Love, Avi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I fall asleep that night, with the medallion in one hand and George II in the other, I know that even if Avi and I aren\u0027t together physically, nothing can keep us apart ever again. Well, except my dad... especially after he finds out Avi and I stayed at a hotel alone. Dodging that bullet will prove harder than dodging those paintballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis adventure called my life is never dull, that\u0027s for sure! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-28.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
