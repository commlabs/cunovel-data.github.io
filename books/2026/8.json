I could see their dark ruby eyes glinting with desire, lusting for the kill. Their lips pulled back over their sharp, wet teeth - some to snarl, some to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the child behind me whimper, but I couldn\u0027t turn to look at him. Though I was desperate to be sure that he was safe, I could not afford any lapse in focus now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ghosted closer, their black robes billowing slightly with the movement. I saw their hands curl into bone-colored claws. They started to drift apart, angling to come at us from all sides. We were surrounded. We were going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, like a burst of light from a flash, the whole scene was different. Yet nothing changed - the Volturi still stalked toward us, poised to kill. All that really changed was how the picture looked to me. Suddenly, I was hungry for it. I tvanfec/them to charge. The panic changed to bloodlust as I crouched forward, a smile on my face, and a growl ripped through my bared teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jolted upright, shocked out of the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was black. It was also steamy hot. Sweat matted my hair at the temples and rolled down my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groped the warm sheets and found them empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, my fingers encountered something smooth and flat and stiff. One sheet of paper, folded in half. I took the note with me and felt my way across the room to the light switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outside of the note was addressed to Mrs. Cullen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m hoping you won\u0027t wake and notice my absence, but, if you should, I\u0027ll be back very soon. I\u0027ve just gone to the mainland to hunt Go back to sleep and I\u0027ll be here when you wake again. I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. We\u0027d been here about two weeks now, so I should have been expecting that he would have to leave, but I hadn\u0027t been thinking about time. We seemed to exist outside of time here, just drifting along in a perfect state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped the sweat off my forehead. I felt absolutely wide awake, though the clock on the dresser said it was after one. I knew i would never be able to sleep as hot and sticky as I felt. Not to mention the fact that if I shut off the light and closed my eyes, I was sure to see those prowling black figures in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and wandered aimlessly through the dark house, flipping on lights. It felt so big and empty without Edward there. Different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up in the kitchen and decided that maybe comfort food was what I needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poked around in the fridge until I found all the ingredients for fried chicken. The popping and sizzling of the chicken in the pan was a nice, homey sound; I felt less nervous while it filled the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt smelled so good that I started eating it right out of the pan, burning my tongue in the process. By the fifth or sixth bite, though, it had cooled enough for me to taste it. My chewing slowed. Was there something off about the flavor? I checked the meat, and it was white all the way through, but I wondered if it was completely done. I took another experimental bite; I chewed twice. Ugh - definitely bad. I jumped up to spit it into the sink. Suddenly, the chicken-and-oil smell was revolting. I took the whole plate and shook it into the garbage, then opened the windows to chase away the scent. A coolish breeze had picked up outside. It felt good on my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was abruptly exhausted, but i didn\u0027t want to go back to the hot room. So I opened more windows in the TV room and lay on the couch right beneath them. I turned on the same movie we\u0027d watched the other day and quickly fell asleep to the bright opening song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes again, the sun was halfway up the sky, but it was not the light that woke me. Cool arms were around me, pulling me against him. At the same time, a sudden pain twisted in my stomach, almost like the aftershock of catching a punch in the gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTm sorry,\" Edward was murmuring as he wiped a wintry hand across my clammy forehead. \"So much for thoroughness. I didn\u0027t think about how hot you would be with me gone. I\u0027ll have an air conditioner installed before I leave again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t concentrate on what he was saying. \"Excuse me!\" I gasped, struggling to get free of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his hold automatically. \"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI streaked for the bathroom with my hand clamped over my mouth. I felt so horrible that I didn\u0027t even care - at first - that he was with me while I crouched over the toilet and was violently sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella? What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t answer yet. He held me anxiously, keeping my hair out of my face, waiting till I could breathe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn rancid chicken,\" I moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" His voice was strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I panted. \"It\u0027s just food poisoning. You don\u0027t need to see this. Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely,Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away,\" I moaned again, struggling to get up so I could rinse my mouth out. He helped me gently, ignoring the weak shoves I aimed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my mouth was clean, he carried me to the bed and sat me down carefully, supporting me with his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Food poisoning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I croaked. \"I made some chicken last night. It tasted off, so I threw it out. But I ate a few bites first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a cold hand on my forehead. It felt nice. \"How do you feel now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that for a moment. The nausea had passed as suddenly as it had come, and I felt like I did any other morning. \"Pretty normal. A little hungry, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made me wait an hour and keep down a big glass of water before he fried me some eggs. I felt perfectly normal, just a little tired from being up in the middle of the night. He put onCNN - we\u0027d been so out of touch, world war three could have broken out and we wouldn\u0027t have known - and I lounged drowsily across his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got bored with the news and twisted around to kiss him. Just like this morning, a sharp pain hit my stomach when I moved. I lurched away from him, my hand tight over my mouth. I knew I\u0027d never make it to the bathroom this time, so I ran to the kitchen sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my hair again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should go back to Rio, see a doctor,\" he suggested anxiously when I was rinsing my mouth afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and edged toward the hallway. Doctors meant needles. \"I\u0027ll be fine right after I brush my teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my mouth tasted better, I searched through my suitcase for the little first-aid kit Alice had packed for me, full of human things like bandages and painkillers and - my object now - Pepto-Bismol. Maybe I could settle my stomach and calm Edward down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before I found the Pepto, I happened across something else that Alice had packed for me. I picked up the small blue box and stared at it in my hand for a long moment, forgetting everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I started counting in my head. Once. Twice. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheknock startled me; the little box fell back into the suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well?\" Edward asked through the door. \"Did you get sick again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes and no,\" I said, but my voice sounded strangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella? Can I please come in?\" Worriedly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O... kay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came in and appraised my position, sitting cross-legged on the floor by the suitcase, and my expression, blank and staring. He sat next to me, his hand going to my forehead at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many days has it been since the wedding?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen,\" he answered automatically. \"Bella, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was counting again. I held up a finger, cautioning him to wait, and mouthed the numbers to myself. I\u0027d been wrong about the days before. We\u0027d been here longer than I\u0027d thought. I started over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella!\" he whispered urgently. \"I\u0027m losing my mind over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to swallow. It didn\u0027t work. So I reached into the suitcase and fumbled around until I found the little blue box of tampons again. I held them up silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me in confusion. \"What? Are you trying to pass this illness off as PMS?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I managed to choke out. \"No, Edward. I\u0027m trying to tell you that my period is five days late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis facial expression didn\u0027t change. It was like I hadn\u0027t spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I have food poisoning,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t respond. He had turned into a sculpture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dreams,\" I mumbled to myself in a flat voice. \"Sleeping so much. The crying. All that food. Oh. Oh. Oh\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s stare seemed glassy, as if he couldn\u0027t see me anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReflexively, almost involuntarily, my hand dropped to my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" I squeaked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lurched to my feet, slipping out of Edward\u0027s unmoving hands. I\u0027d never changed out of the little silk shorts and camisole I\u0027d worn to bed. I yanked the blue fabric out of the way and stared at my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had absolutely no experience with pregnancy or babies or any part of that world, but I wasn\u0027t an idiot. I\u0027d seen enough movies and TV shows to know that this wasn\u0027t how it worked. I was only five days late. If I was pregnant, my body wouldn\u0027t even have registered that fact. I would not have morning sickness. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould not have changed my eating or sleeping habits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I most definitely would not have a small but defined bump sticking out between my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted my torso back and forth, examining it from every angle, as if it would disappear in exactly the right light. I ran my fingers over the subtle bulge, surprised by how rock hard it felt under my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible,\" I said again, because, bulge or no bulge, period or no period (and there was definitely no period, though I\u0027d never been late a day in my life), there was no way I could be pregnant The only person I\u0027d ever had sex with was a vampire, for crying out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vampire who was still frozen on the floor with no sign of ever moving again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there had to be some other explanation, then. Something wrong with me. A strange South American disease with all the signs of pregnancy, only accelerated...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I remembered something - a morning of internet research that seemed a lifetime ago now. Sitting at the old desk in my room at Charlie\u0027s house with gray light glowing dully through the window, staring at my ancient, wheezing computer, reading avidly through a web-site called \"Vampires A-Z.\" It had been less than twenty-four hours since Jacob Black, trying to entertain me with the Quileute legends he didn\u0027t believe in yet, had told me that Edward was a vampire. I\u0027d scanned anxiously through the first entries on the site, which was dedicated to vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emyths around the world. The Filipino Danag, the Hebrew Estrie, the Romanian Varacolaci, the Italian Stregoni benefici (a legend actually based on my new father-in-law\u0027s early exploits with the Volturi, not that I\u0027d known anything about that at the time)... I\u0027d paid less and less attention as the stories had grown more and more implausible. I only remembered vague bits of the later entries. They mostly seemed like excuses dreamed up to explain things like infant mortality rates - and infidelity. No, honey, I\u0027m not having an affair! That sexy woman you saw sneaking out of the house was an evil succubus. I\u0027m lucky I escaped with my life! (Of course, with what I knew now about Tanya and her sisters, I suspected that some of those excuses had been nothing but fact.) There had been one for the ladies, too. How can you accuse me of cheating on you - just because you\u0027ve come home from a two-year sea voyage and I\u0027m pregnant? It was the incubus. He hypnotized me with his mystical vampire powers....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been part of the definition of the incubus - the ability to father children with his hapless prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, dazed. But...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Esme and especially Rosalie. Vampires couldn\u0027t have children. If it were possible, Rosalie would have found a way by now. The incubus myth was nothing but a fable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that... well, there was a difference. Of course Rosalie could not conceive a child, because she was frozen in the state in which she passed from human to inhuman. Totally unchanging. And human women\u0027s bodies had to change to bear children. The constant change of a monthly cycle for one thing, and then the bigger changes needed to accommodate a growing child. Rosalie\u0027s body couldn\u0027t change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut mine could. Mine did. I touched the bump on my stomach that had not been there yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd human men - well, they pretty much stayed the same from puberty to death. I remembered a random bit of trivia, gleaned from who knows where: Charlie Chaplin was in his seventies when he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efathered his youngest child. Men had no such thing as child-bearing years or cycles of fertility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, how would anyone know if vampire men could father children, when their partners were not able? What vampire on earth would have the restraint necessary to test the theory with a human woman? Or the inclination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could think of only one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of my head was sorting through fact and memory and speculation, while the other half - the part that controlled the ability to move even the smallest muscles - was stunned beyond the capacity for normal operations. I couldn\u0027t move my lips to speak, though I wanted to ask Edward to please explain to me what was going on. I needed to go back to where he sat, to touch him, but my body wouldn\u0027t follow instructions. I could only stare at my shocked eyes in the mirror, my fingers gingerly pressed against the swelling on my torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, like in my vivid nightmare last night, the scene abruptly transformed. Everything I saw in the mirror looked completely different, though nothing actually was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to change everything was that a soft little nudge bumped my hand - from inside my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same moment, Edward\u0027s phone rang, shrill and demanding. Neither of us moved. It rang again and again. I tried to tune it out while I pressed my fingers to my stomach, waiting. In the mirror my expression was no longer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebewildered - it was wondering now. I barely noticed when the strange, silent tears started streaming down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone kept ringing. I wished Edward would answer it - I was having a moment. Possibly the biggest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRing! Ring! Ring!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the annoyance broke through everything else. I got down on my knees next to Edward - I found myself moving more carefully, a thousand times more aware of the way each motion felt - and patted his pockets until I found the phone. I half-expected him to thaw out and answer it himself, but he was perfectly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized the number, and I could easily guess why she was calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Alice,\" I said. My voice wasn\u0027t much better than before. I cleared my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella? Bella, areyou okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Urn. Is Carlisle there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is. What\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not... one hundred percent... sure___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Edward all right?\" she asked warily. She called Carlisle\u0027s name away from the phone and then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edemanded, \"Why didn\u0027t he pick up the phone?\" before I could answer her first question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,what\u0027s going on? I just saw - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. \"Here\u0027s Carlisle,\" she finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like ice water had been injected in my veins. If Alice had seen a vision of me with a green-eyed, angel-faced child in my arms, she would have answered me, wouldn\u0027t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I waited through the split second it took for Carlisle to speak, the vision I\u0027d imagined for Alice danced behind my lids. A tiny, beautiful little baby, even more beautiful than the boy in my dream - a tiny Edward in my arms. Warmth shot through my veins, chasing the ice away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, it\u0027s Carlisle. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - \" I wasn\u0027t sure how to answer. Would he laugh at my conclusions, tell me I was crazy? Was I just having another colorful dream? \"I\u0027m a little worried about Edward.... Can vampires go into shock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he been harmed?\" Carlisle\u0027s voice was suddenly urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I assured him. \"Just... taken by surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think... well, I think that... maybe... I might be ...\" I took a deep breath. \"Pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to back me up, there was another tiny nudge in my abdomen. My hand flew to my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long pause, Carlisle\u0027s medical training kicked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was the first day of your last menstrual cycle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen days before the wedding.\" I\u0027d done the mental math thoroughly enough just before to be able to answer with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weird,\" I told him, and my voice broke. Another trickle of tears dribbled down my cheeks. \"This is going to sound crazy - look, I know it\u0027s way too early for any of this. Maybe I am crazy. But I\u0027m having bizarre dreams and eating all the time and crying and throwing up and... and... I swear something moved inside me just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s head snapped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward held his hand out for the phone, his face white and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Urn, I think Edward wants to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put him on,\" Carlisle said in a strained voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot entirely sure that Edward could talk, I put the phone in his outstretched hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed it to his ear. \"Is it possible?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened for a long time, staring blankly at nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Bella?\" he asked. His arm wrapped around me as he spoke, pulling me close into his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened for what seemed like a long time and then said, \"Yes. Yes, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the phone away from his ear and pressed the \"end\" button. Right away, he dialed a new number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Carlisle say?\" I asked impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward answered in a lifeless voice. \"He thinks you\u0027re pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words sent a warm shiver down my spine. The little nudger fluttered inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you calling now?\" I asked as he put the phone back to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The airport. We\u0027re going home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was on the phone for more than an hour without a break. I guessed that he was arranging our flight home, but I couldn\u0027t be sure because he wasn\u0027t speaking English. It sounded like he was arguing; he spoke through his teeth a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he argued, he packed. He whirled around the room like an angry tornado, leaving order rather than destruction in his path. He threw a set of my clothes on the bed without looking at them, so I assumed it was time for me to get dressed. He continued with his argument while I changed, gesturing with sudden, agitated movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I could no longer bear the violent energy radiating out of him, I quietly left the room. His manic concentration made me sick to my stomach - not like the morning sickness, just uncomfortable. I would wait somewhere else for his mood to pass. I couldn\u0027t talk to this icy, focused Edward who honestly frightened me a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, I ended up in the kitchen. There was a bag of pretzels in the cupboard. I started chewing on them absently, staring out the window at the sand and rocks and trees and ocean, everything glittering in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone nudged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t want to go, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared out the window for a moment, but the nudger didn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" i whispered. \"What is wrong here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprising, absolutely. Astonishing, even. But wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why was Edward so furious? He was the one who had actually wished out loud for a shotgun wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to reason through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it wasn\u0027t so confusing that Edward wanted us to go home right away. He\u0027d want Carlisle to check me out, make sure my assumption was right - though there was absolutely no doubt in my head at this point. Probably they\u0027d want to figure out why I was already so pregnant, with the bump and the nudging and all of that. That wasn\u0027t normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I thought of this, I was sure I had it. He must be so worried about the baby. I hadn\u0027t gotten around to freaking out yet. My brain worked slower than his - it was still stuck marveling over the picture it had conjured up before: the tiny child with Edward\u0027s eyes - green, as his had been when he was human - lying fair and beautiful in my arms. I hoped he would have Edward\u0027s face exactly, with no interference from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was funny how abruptly and entirely necessary this vision had become. From that first little touch, the whole world had shifted. Where before there was just one thing i could not live without, now there were two. There was no division - my love was not split between them now; it wasn\u0027t like that. It was more like my heart had grown, swollen up to twice its size in that moment. All that extra space, already filled. The increase was almost dizzying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never really understood Rosalie\u0027s pain and resentment before. I\u0027d never imagined myself a mother, never wanted that. It had been a piece of cake to promise Edward that I didn\u0027t care about giving up children for him, because I truly didn\u0027t. Children, in the abstract, had never appealed to me. They seemed to be loud creatures, often dripping some form of goo. I\u0027d never had much to do with them. When I\u0027d dreamed of Renee providing me with a brother, I\u0027d always imagined an older brother. Someone to take care of me, rather than the other way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis child, Edward\u0027s child, was a whole different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted him like I wanted air to breathe. Not a choice - a necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I just had a really bad imagination. Maybe that was why I\u0027d been unable to imagine that I would like being married until after I already was - unable to see that I would want a baby until after one was already coming....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I put my hand on my stomach, waiting for the next nudge, tears streaked down my cheeks again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, made wary by the tone of his voice. It was too cold, too careful. His face matched his voice, empty and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he saw that I was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella!\" Hecrossed the room in a flash and put his hands on my face. \"Are you in pain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me against his chest. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. We\u0027ll be home in sixteen hours. You\u0027ll be fine. Carlisle will be ready when we get there. We\u0027ll take care of this, and you\u0027ll be fine, you\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of this? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned away and looked me in the eye. \"We\u0027re going to get that thing out before it can hurt any part of you. Don\u0027t be scared. I wont let it hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That thing?\" Igasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked sharply away from me, toward the front door. \"Dammit! I forgot Gustavo was due today. HI get rid of him and be right back.\" He darted out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutched the counter for support. My knees were wobbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had just called my little nudger a thing. He said Carlisle would get it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d gotten it wrong before. He didn\u0027t care about the baby atall. He wanted to hurt him. The beautiful picture in my head shifted abruptly, changed into something dark. My pretty baby crying, my weak arms not enough to protect him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could I do? Would I be able to reason with them? What if I couldn\u0027t? Did this explain Alice\u0027s strange silence on the phone? Is that what she\u0027d seen? Edward and Carlisle killing that pale, perfect child before he could live?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whispered again, my voice stronger. That could not be. I would not allow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Edward speaking Portuguese again. Arguing again. His voice got closer, and I heard him grunt in exasperation. Then I heard another voice, low and timid. A woman\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came into the kitchen ahead of her and went straight to me. He wiped the tears from my cheeks and murmured in my ear through the thin, hard line of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s insisting on leaving the food she brought - she made us dinner.\" If he had been less tense, less furious, I knew he would have rolled his eyes. \"It\u0027s an excuse - she wants to make sure I haven\u0027t killed you yet.\" His voice went ice cold at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaure edged nervously around the corner with a covered dish in her hands. I wished I could speak Portuguese, or that my Spanish was less rudimentary, so that I could try to thank this woman who had dared to anger a vampire just to check on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flickered between the two of us. I saw her measuring thecolor in my face, the moisture in my eyes. Mumbling something I didn\u0027t understand, she put the dish on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward snapped something at her; I\u0027d never heard him be so impolite before. She turned to go, and the whirling motion of her long skirt wafted the smell of the food into my face. It was strong - onions and fish. I gagged and whirled for the sink. I felt Edward\u0027s hands on my forehead and heard his soothing murmur through the roaring in my ears. His hands disappeared for a second, and I heard the refrigerator slam shut. Mercifully, the smell disappeared with the sound, and Edward\u0027s hands were cooling my clammy face again. It was over quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rinsed my mouth in the tap while he caressed the side of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tentative little nudge in my womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s okay. We\u0027re okay,I thought toward the bump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward turned me around, pulling me into his arms. I rested my head on his shoulder. My hands, instinctively, folded over my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a little gasp and I looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was still there, hesitating in the doorway with her hands half-outstretched as if she had been looking for some way to help. Her eyes were locked on my hands, popping wide with shock. Her mouth hung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Edward gasped, too, and he suddenly turned to face the woman, pushing me slightly behind his body. His arm wrapped across my torso, like he was holding me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Kaure was shouting at him - loudly, furiously, her unintelligible words flying across the room like knives. She raised her tiny fist in the air and took two steps forward, shaking it at him. Despite her ferocity, it was easy to see the terror in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stepped toward her, too, and I clutched at his arm, frightened for the woman. But when he interrupted her tirade, his voice took me by surprise, especially considering how sharp he\u0027d been with her when she wasn\u0027t screeching at him. It was low now; it was pleading. Not only that, but the sound was different, more guttural, the cadence off. I didn\u0027t think he was speaking Portuguese anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, the woman stared at him in wonder, and then her eyes narrowed as she barked out a long question in the same alien tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as his face grew sad and serious, and he nodded once. She took a quick step back and crossed herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out to her, gesturing toward me and then resting his hand against my cheek. She replied angrily again, waving her hands accusingly toward him, and then gestured to him. When she finished, he pleaded again with the same low, urgent voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression changed - she stared at him with doubt plain on her face as he spoke, her eyes repeatedly flashing to my confused face. He stopped speaking, and she seemed to be deliberating something. She looked back and forth between the two of us, and then, unconsciously it seemed, took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a motion with her hands, miming a shape like a balloon jutting out from her stomach. I started\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- did her legends of the predatory blood-drinker include this? Could she possibly know something about what was growing inside me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked a few steps forward deliberately this time and asked a few brief questions, which he responded to tensely. Then he became the questioner - one quick query. She hesitated and then slowly shook her head. When he spoke again, his voice was so agonized that I looked up at him in shock. His face was drawn with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, she walked slowly forward until she was close enough to lay her small hand on top of mine, over my stomach. She spoke one word in Portuguese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morte,\"she sighed quietly. Then she turned, her shoulders bent as if the conversation had aged her, and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew enough Spanish for that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was frozen again, staring after her with the tortured expression fixed on his face. A few moments later, I heard a boat\u0027s engine putter to life and then fade into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward did not move until I started for the bathroom. Then his hand caught my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" His voice was a whisper of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To brush my teeth again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about what she said. It\u0027s nothing but legends, old lies for the sake of entertainment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t understand anything,\" I told him, though it wasn\u0027t entirely true. As if I could discount something because it was a legend. My life was circled by legend on every side. They were all true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I packed your toothbrush. I\u0027ll get it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked ahead of me to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we leaving soon?\" I called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as you\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for my toothbrush to repack it, pacing silently around the bedroom. I handed it to him when I was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get the bags into the boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, trying to think of some way to get a few seconds alone. \"Could you... pack some of the food? You know, in case I get hungry again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" he said, his eyes suddenly soft. \"Don\u0027t worry about anything. We\u0027ll get to Carlisle in just a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efew hours, really. This will all be over soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, not trusting my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and left the room, one big suitcase in each hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whirled and scooped up the phone he\u0027d left on the counter. It was very unlike him to forget things - to forget that Gustavo was coming, to leave his phone lying here. He was so stressed he was barely himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped it open and scrolled through the preprogrammed numbers. I was glad he had the sound turned off, afraid that he would catch me. Would he be at the boat now? Or back already? Would he hear me from the kitchen if I whispered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the number I wanted, one I had never called before in my life. I pressed the \"send\" button and crossed my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" the voice like golden wind chimes answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie?\" I whispered. \"It\u0027s Bella. Please. You have to help me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-8.html","bookId":2026,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM"}
