How do you know him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I met him during the war. He’s a handy man to know if you want a gun that can’t be traced.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a criminal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What exactly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess you could say he walks a fine line. No one who ever crossed him lived to brag about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any more questions?” Rane asked, a hint of a smile in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBending down, Rane kissed her on the forehead. “I’m going to rest for a few hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” She placed the gun on the table, then watched him leave the room. He was going to sleep in Mara’s lair. Like a dragon. No doubt about it, Savanah mused. Her life just kept getting more and more bizarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRane woke shortly after sunset. He remained where he was for a time, his arms folded under his head as his gaze roamed Mara’s lair. The room was a reflection of the woman—ancient and beautiful. The king-size bed was hung with white gauze curtains. Wrought-iron sconces held fat beeswax candles. A thick white carpet covered the floor, expensive paintings adorned the walls, several pieces of rare Egyptian art were scattered around the room. A golden tiara set with precious stones lay in a careless pile amid dozens of other pieces of jewelry on the top of an antique dresser. Each one was likely worth a small fortune. An arched doorway opened onto a large bathroom done in black and gold. The sunken tub and oval sink had gold faucets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara. She had the grace and bearing of a queen. Looking at her, no one would guess she had existed for thousands of years. What was it like for her to see nations rise and fall while she stayed forever the same? He had been a Vampire for almost a hundred years. Did he have the staying power to endure for centuries? Not many Vampires did. Mortals dreamed of living forever, but he wondered how many would accept it if they knew how long forever could be. It wasn’t easy being a Vampire, watching the world change, watching those you loved age and die. Some Vampires kept to themselves, refusing to mingle with the mortal world, refusing to form attachments, preferring to endure in solitude rather than face the pain of losing those they loved over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, he left Mara’s lair and headed for the upstairs bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah looked up from the book she was reading when she heard the shower come on. Rane was awake. Naked. In the shower upstairs. The thought sent a shaft of heat spiraling through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting the book on the table, she hurried up the stairs to see if Rane needed someone to wash his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused in the doorway a moment, admiring his broad back, the spread of his shoulders, his tight buns and long, long legs. He really was a beautiful creature, she thought, and felt herself blush when said beautiful creature turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows went up when he saw her standing on the other side of the shower door, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” Savanah said. “I just came to see if you, ah, needed someone to wash your back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone as in…you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see anyone else standing here, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a soul,” he said with a roguish grin, and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerves thrumming with anticipation, she undressed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was hoping for another striptease,” Rane remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe next time.” She was about to step into the shower when he shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get rid of that first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking down, Savanah saw the silver cross resting between her breasts. Wearing it had become such a habit, she hardly thought about it anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, sorry.” Removing the crucifix, she placed it on the sink top before stepping into the shower, and into Rane’s waiting arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can shower with me anytime,” Rane murmured as he drew her closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm water sluiced over the two of them. Savanah rubbed her breasts against his chest, wanting to be closer, loving the slick wetness of his skin against her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We seem to spend a lot of time in water,” Savanah remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked a drop from the tip of her nose. “Are you complaining?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no, just making an observation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering his head, he dropped kisses along the length of her neck, along the edge of her collarbone, in the hollow of her throat where her pulse beat hot and quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A taste?” he asked, his voice low and husky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You haven’t fed yet, have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” His voice was almost a growl now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore under his breath, but didn’t argue. Putting her away from him, he picked up the soap, worked up a lather in his hands, and starting at her shoulders, worked his way down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he reached her belly, she was having trouble breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he reached her thighs, she was a quivering mass of need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A taste, Savanah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s blackmail,” she accused, but at the moment, she didn’t really care. She wanted him, wanted all of him, now, inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his fingertips over her belly. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one taste?” she asked. “You promise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, wondering if she could trust him when he was looking at her like that, when his eyes were glowing with hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingertips caressed the outer curve of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just do it,” she said, and turned her head to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth was incredibly hot against her skin, the pleasure beyond words. He backed her up against the glass, then lifted her so that she was straddling his waist, his mouth still at her throat as his body melded with hers, and she didn’t care if he took one taste or twenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn’t care if he took it all…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Savanah? Dammit, Savanah, can you hear me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of his voice, she opened her eyes and smiled. “I hear you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was warm against her cheek as he muttered a string of curses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you so angry?” she asked. “Wasn’t it good for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought…Dammit, I was afraid I’d taken too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrying her out of the shower, he quickly dried her off, then carried her into the bedroom and placed her gently on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you’re all right?” he asked, drawing the quilt over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you do,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not supposed to growl at me afterward,” she complained. “You’re supposed to hug me and tell me you love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of his head, he pulled her into his arms, quilt and all. “I do love you. That’s the trouble. Next time I promise to take just one taste, don’t believe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much did you take?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. More than I should have.” He hadn’t meant to, but one taste had only served to whet his appetite for more. He had been hungry for her, and she was so sweet…for a moment, he had lost himself in the sheer pleasure of feeding. He swore softly. It couldn’t happen again. “Stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To get you something to eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t realized she was hungry until he mentioned food. “I can do it.” She started to get up, only to fall back on the bed when the room began to spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay here,” he said again, and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, he thawed a steak in the microwave and quickly fried it up, his nose wrinkling at the stink of cooking meat. When it was done, he filled a glass with orange juice, plucked a gold-plated knife and fork from the drawer and carried everything upstairs. On the way back to the bedroom, he made a detour into the bathroom. Using the fork, he scooped up Savanah’s crucifix, then went into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the edge of the bed, he offered her the cross. “Put it on, and don’t take it off again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, she slid the chain over her head. The silver felt cool against her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRane’s expression was grim as he cut the steak and fed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too rare,” she protested. “I like it cooked a little more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried not to notice the juices that oozed from the meat. “It’s better for you this way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe insisted she eat all of it and drink the orange juice, then he tucked her into bed. “Get some sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing the worry in his voice, she said, “I’m all right. Honest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, though he wasn’t convinced. He had brought her here to protect her but he couldn’t help wondering if she wouldn’t be safer without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed by her side until she fell asleep, then continued to sit there, staring out the window, his thoughts turned toward his brother. Why couldn’t he have been more like Rafe? Things had always come easy for his brother. Rafe had been the popular one in school, easygoing, affable, always at home in a crowd, while Rane had always held back a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Savanah, wondering where their relationship would end. It had been an odd twist of fate that had brought a Vampire and a future Vampire hunter together. No matter which way he looked at it, he couldn’t see a happy ending. But even knowing that, he couldn’t let her go. As long as those books existed, her life was in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted softly. He could destroy the books, but it wouldn’t do much good. He didn’t know who wanted them. Even if he put out the word that the books had been destroyed, he had no guarantee that whoever was looking for them would hear of it, or believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, he went downstairs and out to his car where he retrieved both volumes. Carrying them inside, he locked the door, then sat down in the living room, opened the black book, and began to read. It gave him a strange feeling, seeing the long list of names of the Undead. Many of them were familiar to him even though he had never met them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting the black book aside, he picked up the brown one. He wondered how long it had taken Savanah’s mother to compile her facts and if she’d had help. There were numerous books about Vampires, but he had never seen one that was so comprehensive or so accurate. She had it all: how to locate Vampires, how to destroy them, the various Supernatural powers they possessed. There was even a short section on Werewolves. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-pleasure-children-of-the-night-4/page-33.html","bookId":2302,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}
