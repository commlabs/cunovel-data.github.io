The six Heavenly Core Nucleus of the Heavenly Kings he had just slain flew in from different directions. The Dark Demon God Lightning had blown up the three Heavenly Kings, but their Heavenly Core Nucleus still remained. Six Heavenly Core Nucleus, warping into six rays of light, shooting into the skies towards the light, as if six stars rising into the heavens.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs the six stars soared up, from up above, six rays of faint gold astral light shone down upon Zhou Weiqing, staining his body, still wearing the dark gold ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, with a brilliant gold astral light.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing bathed in this astral light, in the distance, Long Shiya could sense the energies within his body growing rapidly.

It was the Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui’s Heavenly Core Nucleus. This time, the speed of the gold light rising was far faster than the previous six lights. It was almost as if in a gold flash, it had reached the heavens, and the corresponding astral light shone upon the Zhou Weiqing in the next instant.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis time, the gold light almost formed a pillar, with a half metre radius.

This was not as simple as humans creating something, but the greatest Power of Creation in the world. The entire world was constructed by this most purest and original of energies, and the stars in the skies were also formed from this.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat Zhou Weiqing had said was indeed true. Every Heavenly Core Nucleus had the potential to become a star in the skies, however this required a incomparably long process of evolution and development. These Heavenly King and Heavenly Emperors’ Heavenly Core Nucleus were naturally not real stars, but they held the same attributes and auras as stars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Core Nucleus was consolidated and formed from this core origin Saint Energy. The words Astral Core was not named for nothing. A Heavenly Core Nucleus was only the embryonic form of a star, but his Astral Core Nucleus was truly the core of the stars. Any true star had its own astral core!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs such, Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Core Nucleus was at a far higher level than even any Heavenly God’s Heavenly Core Nucleus.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOf course, with his current cultivation, he was far from being able to wield the full power of the Astral Saint Core Nucleus. Limited by his own cultivation, the Astral Saint Core Nucleus would be limited in terms of its evolving for now.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, that would not stop him from borrowing the power of the Astral Saint Core Nucleus. What he had just done earlier was to use his Astral Saint Core Nucleus to activate the astral power of the stars in the skies, causing echo and resonance to feedback back into itself. After that, when he released the energy of the six Heavenly Kings and one Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Core Nucleus, it was tantamount to sending this purest Astral energies into the skies, before gaining the resonant Astral power in return.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePerhaps the total power of this Astral power was far below that of the seven Heavenly Core Nucleus, but it was the purest Astral power without any impurities, able to be used directly and infused into his Astral Saint Core Nucleus. Added on to the fact that Zhou Weiqing had already Devoured such a large amount of Heavenly Energy just now, the two factors had combined to push him from the Mid Level Heavenly King stage to the High Level Heavenly King Stage. If the Devour Skill could be considered the top method of increasing one’s cultivation in the human realm, then this Resonance Method of the Astral powers could be considered the top method in the realm of gods, one that defied the heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Zhou Weiqing had first consolidated his Astral Saint Core Nucleus, he had gained some of this understand. However, at that time it had not been too deep and profound. However, after this entire process, he was slowly beginning to grasp the true meaning and understand of the Astral powers and the Resonance method.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe final ending of the Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui could be said to be fully under Zhou Weiqing’s calculations. With the Possession of the Demon God, Zhou Weiqing had sealed Meng Gui’s senses towards the outside world. At that time, Long Shiya could actually clearly sense the atmospheric energies all around having a strange reverberation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing had continued speaking with Meng Gui, and that was all to delay for time. For the current him to use the Astral powers, it actually required a rather long build up time. It was thus extremely difficult to use while in actual combat. Originally, when he had consolidated the tenth set of Heavenly Jewels, his tenth Elemental Jewel was already filled with Astral powers. In this case, it was similar to the seventh Jewel, unable to Store any other Skills. However, it was the source of him being able to activate the Astral Resonance Method.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe final result had proved that Zhou Weiqing had succeeded. When the Astral powers were really activated by him, let alone the already injured Meng Gui; in such a situation, an uninjured Heavenly Emperor would not be able to withstand the power of the Astral powers, and even a Heavenly God might have to escape instead of taking it head on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe greatest weakness of the Astral power was its extremely long build up time. Of course, that was also because of Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation, and at least currently it wasn’t pragmatic in function.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Master, please move back a little.” Zhou Weiqing said respectfully to Long Shiya.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, Long Shiya still felt as if this was all a dream.

A young lady of absolute beauty, in a white dress, rose up into the air to hover by his side.

After that, he had entered the Heavenly Bow Unit, and then to the Fei Li Royal Family Military Academy. When he had led the Fei Li Battle Team to win the Heavenly Jewel Tournament championship, his first grand achievement in his life, he had suddenly learnt of the bad news of his homeland falling.

It was filled with despair, vexation, anger, killing intent, bloodlust… all sorts of negative emotions, even fear and terror. It was no wonder that even a Darkness Attribute Heavenly Emperor like Meng Gui did not dare to easily try to break down the Seal. Once he attempted doing so, these negative emotions would swell up and counterattack him at once. Even if he could withstand it, it would leave a mark on his soul, possibly causing future harm to his cultivation.
