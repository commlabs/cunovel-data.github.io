He was grinning from ear to ear, from nose to chin, from here to there, and back again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, D.J.,\" Todd shouted, \"glad to see you.\" Todd was a pushover for smiling faces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls heard him. She began to write Todd\u0027s name on the board under DISCIPLINE, but when she saw D.J.\u0027s smile, she put down the chalk. \"Good morning, D.J.,\" she said. \"What are you so happy about?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e DJ. grinned and shrugged his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e 65Dameon looked at the smile on Mrs. Jewls\u0027s face, then at Todd\u0027s, and finally at D.J.\u0027s. Then Dameon smiled, too. His smile was almost as big as D.J.\u0027s. They were best friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e Once they saw the two of them smiling, the rest of the class couldn\u0027t help but smile. Rondi had a very cute one, due to her two missing front teeth. Nobody had an ugly smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason came to school late. He was very upset. But the first thing he saw was Dameon\u0027s smile, and he felt a little bit better. Then he saw Rondi\u0027s toothless grin, and he even began to smile a little himself. But when he saw the piano on D.J.\u0027s face, he fell, laughing, onto the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody started to laugh, even Kathy, and she hardly ever laughed except when someone hurt himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The whole room seemed to be laughing, not just the people in it. The blackboard chuckled. The ceiling snickered. The desks were jumping up and down, and the chairs were slapping one another on the back. The floor was very ticklish. It laughed until the walls turned purple. The wastepaper basket started to sing, and all the pencils stood up and danced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Finally things began to settle down. Mrs. Jewls wiped her eyes and said, \"D.J., why don\u0027t you tell the class why you are so happy? At least let us know what we are laughing about.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But D.J. just kept on smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aw, come on, D.J.,\" said Deedee. \"Tell us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. didn\u0027t say a word. He couldn\u0027t. His mouth was stretched out of shape.\n\u003cbr\u003e 66\"Let us guess,\" said Ron. \"If we guess right, will you tell us?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. nodded his head. His smile began to hurt his ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone took one guess.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you been swimming?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it your birthday?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you in love?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you get a green ball?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody guessed right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At recess D.J. was still smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis, the yard teacher, called, \"Hey, D.J. Come here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They walked to the far corner of the playground, where they were alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s up, D.J.?\" Louis asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. just smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come on, D.J. You can tell me. Why are you so happy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. looked up at him. He said, \"You need a reason to be sad.
