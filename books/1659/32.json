They had escaped their problems for a few hours, but now reality settled over her again, burying her with worries of this shelter, with its dwindling supplies and combustible politics. The world outside, with its fires and storms. No matter how much she tried to push them away, the problems wouldn’t leave her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you might like this piece of metal more than I do,” Perry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.” She realized she’d been toying with the Blood Lord chain at his neck. “I didn’t mean to keep you awake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t. I can’t sleep either. We should try talking. . . . We’re getting so good at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave his ribs a gentle nudge for his sarcasm, but accepted the suggestion. “We need to figure out our next move, Perry. We’re stuck here. The only way that’s going to change is if . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is if . . . ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We go back to Sable. He has the Hovers we need.” She instantly wanted to take the words back. The thought of going back to Sable couldn’t have repelled her more, but what other choice was there? If they didn’t try something, they were no better than Caleb and Rune, resigned to waiting out their last days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right about the Hovers,” Perry said. “I’ve been thinking the same thing. But we won’t have to chase Sable. He’ll come to us. I was going to tell you that earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill rippled down her back. “Why do you think so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cinder.” After a pause, he added, “And it’s what I’d do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say that, Perry. You’re nothing like him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He told me I was, in the Komodo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say anything for a long moment. Then he kissed the top of her head. “Try to sleep. Tomorrow’s coming, whether we worry about it or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreamed of a fleet of Hovers, perched along the bluff and crowded along the cove’s beach, their iridescent exteriors catching the light of the Aether. And of Sable, a dark figure against the pale sand and the foaming waves, only the jewels at his neck sparkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, that was exactly what she saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEREGRINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants to talk to you alone, Peregrine,” Reef said. “No weapons. No one else. He said he’d clear the cove or meet you on neutral footing of your choice. There’s one other thing. He wanted me to tell you that he gave his people orders to storm the cave if you kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry rubbed the back of his neck and found it damp with sweat. The Tides stood around him in the central cavern, murmurs of agitation rising from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry had expected Sable to come, but he wasn’t sure if he was capable of negotiating with the Horns’ Blood Lord. The last time they’d been together, he had sworn to rip Sable apart with his bare hands. He wanted that more than ever, but he was cornered. He had no other options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone spoke at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Six, cursing loudly and protesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinder, yelling, “You can’t go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar, stepping forward. “Let me go with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s eyes went to Aria, quiet amid the chaos. Marron stood beside her. They watched him with worry in their eyes. They understood. Talking with Sable was his only move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than ten minutes later, he walked outside, weaponless as requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable stood by the water, his stance relaxed as he waited. His territory was in the mountains—jagged peaks, topped year-round with snow—but he looked comfortable with his shoes sinking into wet sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Perry neared, Sable lifted his eyebrows, amusement flashing over his face. “You know, I did say alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry followed his gaze. Flea padded silently over the sand a few steps behind him. Perry shook his head, but it actually heartened him to see the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable smiled. “You’re looking well. Almost healed. Wearing your chain proudly in spite of everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery one of his words carried a darker meaning. A hidden jab. It reminded Perry of his brother. Vale had spoken this way too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going through your mind right now, Peregrine? Is it the way you’d like to beat me as I did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would be a start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should have taken a different path, you and I. If you’d come to Rim with Olivia, as Vale and I had planned, it could have changed everything between us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on Sable’s face was so rapt, so absorbed, it made Perry’s stomach turn. “Get on with it, Sable. You’re here to offer us passage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable crossed his arms, turning to the water. “It had occurred to me.” Beneath the vibrant red and blue of the sky, the water looked gray, the waves like hammered steel. “Striking a deal would be easier than me having to force my way into that den of yours to get what I need. I hope we can find a way to compromise. The only way we survive is together, which you realize or you wouldn’t be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have four hundred thirty people,” Perry said. “If you can’t accommodate all of them, then I have nothing more to say to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can. I have room for all of them on the fleet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry knew why Sable had space on the Hovers—but he couldn’t stop himself from asking. “What happened to the Dwellers from the Komodo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were there,” Sable answered without looking away from the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to hear you say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable’s temper heated at Perry’s tone, and a low growl rumbled from Flea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quite a few were lost during the insurrection. More than half, in fact. Hess’s fault, not mine. I was trying to avoid bloodshed. Of those who survived, I kept the useful ones. Pilots. Doctors. A few engineers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had kept them and killed the rest. Fury washed over Perry, though he wasn’t surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many weren’t useful?” he asked. He didn’t know why he needed a number. Maybe it was the only way to grasp the loss. To connect with people who’d died senselessly. Maybe he wanted to quantify Sable’s ruthlessness. Futile, Perry knew. He could drop a stone into the black well of Sable’s heart and never hear it hit the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see how it makes any difference, Perry. They were just Dwellers. Ahh . . . wait. I see now. Aria. She’s made you sympathetic to the Moles, hasn’t she? Of course she has. Amazing. Three hundred years of segregation undone by a single girl. She must be as incredible as she looks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So that we’re clear,” Perry said, “I don’t care if it means everyone on this earth loses any chance of surviving. If you mention her to me again, I will take your head off and watch your blood pool at my feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable’s eyes narrowed, his mouth turning up in a faint smile. “I’ve made many enemies in my life, but I do think you’re my finest achievement.” He turned back to the water. Across the southern horizon, only a mile away at points, funnels lashed down. “I did what I had to do in the Komodo. You know what happened in the Unity. I had no interest in being discarded by the Moles. In being shut out by them like some mangy dog left in the rain. No offense to your friend here. I have Dweller numbers that I can control now. That was my only intention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry wasn’t interested in Sable’s justification for what had been a slaughter. He needed to get them back on target. On the task of leaving to the Still Blue. If he focused on his hatred, the conversation would lead in a clear and violent direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said your offer is for everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Sable said. “There is a place for every one of them. Dweller or Outsider. That is what I’m here to offer. But you have to bring the boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry looked down at Flea, suddenly feeling weightless. Like he had lifted out of his body and was floating upward. He saw the shape of the Tides’ coast in his mind. He saw himself there on the beach with Sable, discussing Cinder’s life like it was a bargaining tool, when it was actually a blood sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced himself to finish what had begun. “When we reach the Still Blue, we separate. As soon as the journey is done, the Tides and Horns part ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could make some kind of arrangement when we get there, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Perry said. “We make an arrangement now. You walk away from my tribe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parting ways might not be the most beneficial decision. We have no idea what we’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swear to it or we’re done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable stared at him, his ice blue eyes calculating. Perry concentrated on keeping his breathing even. On controlling the furious beating of his heart. His thoughts were already shifting to Cinder and the conversation he’d need to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable inclined his head. “After we cross, the Tides will remain yours alone.” He was quiet for a moment, a smile spreading over his lips. “So, Peregrine,” he said. “I can uphold my side of our bargain. . . . Can you uphold yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s eyes flashed like daggers as he came back into the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strode up to Aria, his expression intent and feral, barely pausing as he leaned in to her. “I have to talk to Cinder,” he said, his voice breaking with emotion. “I’ll be back as soon as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked for Cinder and Marron and then he was off, making a direct path to the Battle Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria watched him go, her heart beating hard in her chest. What had just happened? What had Sable said? She looked around, seeing dazed looks on the faces of everyone around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I miss something?” Straggler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we all did,” said Brooke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had expected a decision, news of some arrangement with Sable, but the waiting wasn’t over yet. Slowly, one by one, the crowd dissipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar stood in a small circle with the Six, exchanging ideas about what might have happened. Aria tried to follow their conversation, but she couldn’t concentrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria,” Brooke said, walking up. “Do you have some time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria nodded. She moved away from Roar and the others and sat heavily on the wooden platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t see you last night,” Brooke said, sitting next to her. “I mean I saw you, but we didn’t have a chance to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was making an effort to be friendly, finally, but Aria felt numb. Her mind was on Perry, and she couldn’t think of anything to say in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke looked away; her eyes scanned the darkness before coming back to Aria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you first came to the Tides, I had lost Liv. And . . . Perry, too, in a way. You even took Roar, which I didn’t realize I’d care about as much as I do—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t take anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Brooke said. “That’s what I’m trying to say. I know you didn’t, but it felt that way. When you came, everything that was mine suddenly became yours . . . except for Clara. You brought my sister back. You got her out of that Pod, and she matters more to me than everything else. Anyway, I wanted to thank you. And . . . sorry it took me a while to say it,” she added. Brooke stood and walked away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/into-the-still-blue-under-the-never-sky-3/page-32.html","bookId":1659,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:56 PM"}
