She was carryingpiles of folded linen sheets given to her by Laun dress, and she was doing her best to look like a slave. Laundress had smudged her face artisticallywith dirt to disguise her. She had also sifted ahandful of dust into Maggie\u0027s hair to dull the auburn into a lifeless brown, and when Maggie bowedher head over the sheets, the hair further obscuredher features. The only problem was that she wasconstantly afraid she was going to sneeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are the wild animals,\" Chamber-pot Emptier whispered over her shoulder. She was a bigboned girl with gentle eyes that reminded Maggieof the calves tethered by Laundress\u0027s hut. It had taken Laundress a while to make her understandwhat they wanted of her, but now she seemed tofeel obligated to give Maggie a tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re brought in from Outside,\" she said. \"And they\u0027re dangerous. Maggie looked sideways at the wicker cageswhere Sylvia and Gavin had walked earlier. Fromone a brown-gray wolf stared back at her with afrighteningly sad and steady gaze. In another a sleek black panther was pacing, and it snarled asthey went by. There was something curled up inthe back of a third that might have been a tigerit was big, and it had stripes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" she said. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to chase that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChamber-pot Emptier seemed pleased. \"Andhere\u0027s the castle. It\u0027s called Black Dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\" Maggie said, distracted away from theanimals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what my grandpa called it, anyway. Helived and died in the courtyard without ever goingin.\" Chamber-pot Emptier thought a moment andadded, \"The old people say that you used to be ableto see the sun in the sky-not just behind theclouds, you know. And when the sun came up inthe morning it shone on the castle. But maybethat\u0027s just a story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, maybe it was just a story that you couldsee the sun in the sky, Maggie thought grimly.Every time she thought this place couldn\u0027t surpriseher anymore, she discovered she was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the castle itself was impressive ... awe inspiring. It was the only thing in view that wasn\u0027t dusty brown or pallid gray. Its walls were shinyand black, almost mirror-like in places, and Maggie didn\u0027t have to be told that it wasn\u0027t built of anyordinary human stone. How they had gotten it tothis valley was a mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelos lives here, she thoughtasEmptier led herup a stone staircase, past the ground floor which was just cellars and storage rooms. In this beautiful, frightening, impressive place. Not only lives init, but commands it. It\u0027s all his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got just a glimpse of the great hall, whereshe\u0027d seen slaves setting a long table yesterday. Chamber-pot Emptier led her up another floor andinto a series of winding corridors that seemed to go on for miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dim in this internal labyrinth. The windows were high and narrow and hardly let any ofthe pale daylight in. On the walls there were candles in brackets and flares in iron rings, but theyonly seemed to add wavering, confusing shadowsto the twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His bedroom\u0027s up here,\" Emptier murmured finally. Maggie followed her closely. She was justthinking that they had made it all the way withouteven being challenged, when a voice sounded from a side corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going? Who\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a guard, Maggie saw, peering from underher hair. A real medieval guard, with, of all things,a lance. There was another one in the opposite cor ridor just like him. She was fascinated in the middle of her terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Chamber-pot Emptier of the not-so-quickwits reacted beautifully. She took time to curtsey, then she said slowly and stolidly, \"It\u0027s Folder fromthe laundry, sir. Laundress sent her with the sheetsand I was told she could help me. There\u0027s morework because of the guests, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Chamber Maid\u0027s work to spread sheets,\" theguard said irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChamber-pot Emptier curtsied again and said just as slowly, \"Yes, sir, but there\u0027s more work because of the guests, you see-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, fine,\" the guard broke in impatiently. \"Whydon\u0027t you go and do it, instead of talking about it?\"He seemed to think that was funny, and he turned and elbowed the other guard in the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChamber-pot Emptier curtseyed a third time and walked on, not hurrying. Maggie tried to copy the curtsey, with her face buried in the sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another endless corridor, then a doorway, and then Emptier said, \"We\u0027re here. Andthere\u0027s nobody.around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie lifted her face from the sheets. \"You\u0027re absolutely wonderful, you know that? You deservean Academy Award.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind. But you were great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only told the truth,\" the girl said placidly, butthere was a smile lurking in the depths of her gentle cowlike eyes. \"There is more work when guestscome. We never had them before three years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie nodded. \"I know. Look, I guess you\u0027d better go now. And um-Emptier?\" She couldn\u0027t bring herself to say the entire name. \"I really hope you don\u0027t get in trouble because of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChamber-pot Emptier nodded back, then went toreach under the bed and retrieve a ceramic container. She walked out again holding it carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie looked around the room, which was verybig and very bare. It was somewhat better lit thanthe corridors, having several bowl-shaped oil lampson stands. The bed was the only real piece of furniture in it. It was huge, with a heavy wooden frameand carved bedposts. Piled on top of it were quiltsand what looked like fur coverlets, and hanging allaround it were linen curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m probably supposed to take all that stuff off and put the clean sheets on, Maggie thought. Shedidn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the furniture seemed to be largechests made of exotic-looking wood, and a fewbenches and stools. Nothing that offered a hidingplace. But on one side there was a curtaineddoorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie went through it and found a small anteroom-the wardrobe Jeanne had mentioned. It wasmuch bigger than she\u0027d expected, and seemed tobe more of a storeroom than a closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. So I\u0027ll just sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two stools beside a figure thatvaguely resembled a dressmaker\u0027s dummy. Maggie dropped her sheets on a chest and pulled one ofthe stools close to the doorway. Through the spacebetween the linen curtains she could see almost theentire bedchamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect, she thought. All I have to do is wait untilhe comes in alone. And then She stiffened. She could hear voices from somewhere beyond the vast bedroom. No, she couldhear a voice, a musical girlish voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, please, she thought. Not her.Don\u0027t let him come in with her. I\u0027ll have to jump out and hit herwith something; I won\u0027t be able to stop myself... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when two figures came in the room, she hadno desire to jump out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sylvia, all right, but she wasn\u0027t with Delos.She was with Hunter Redfern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie felt ice down her spine. Now, what werethese two doing in Delos\u0027s bedroom? Whatever itwas, if they caught her, she was dead meat. Sheheld herself absolutely still, but she couldn\u0027t tear herself away from the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s out riding, and he won\u0027t be back for another half hour,\" Sylvia was saying. She was wearing a dark holly-green gown and carrying a basket.\"And I\u0027ve sent all the servants away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so,\" Hunter Redfern said. He gently movedthe heavy wooden door until it was almost shut.Not all the way, but enough to screen the bedchamber from anyone outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think he\u0027s spying on our rooms?\" Sylvia turned in a swirl of skirts to look at the tallman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s brightmuch smarter than you give himcredit for. And these old castles have spy-holes and listening tubes built in; I remember. It\u0027s a stupidprince who doesn\u0027t make use of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembers, Maggie thought, for a moment too full of wonder to be scared. He remembers thedays when castles were built, he means. He\u0027s reallybeen alive that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied the handsome face under the bloodred hair, the aristocratic cheekbones, the mobile mouth-and the quick flashing eyes. This was thesort of man who could fascinate people, she decided. Like Delos, there was a sort of leashed tension about him, a reserve of power and intelligence that made an ordinary person feel awed. He was a leader, a commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a hunter, Maggie thought. All these peopleare hunters, but he\u0027s the Hunter, the epitome ofwhat they are. His name says it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sylvia was talking again. \"What is it that he\u0027snot supposed to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a message from Outside. Don\u0027t ask how,I have my ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have your little bats,\" Sylvia said demurely.\"I\u0027ve seen them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, then Hunter said, \"You\u0027d better watch yourself, girl. That mouth\u0027s going to getyou in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia had her face turned away from him, butMaggie saw her swallow. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t knowit was a secret. But what\u0027s happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The biggest news in your short life.\" Hunter Redfern laughed once and added with apparentgood humor restored, \"And maybe in mine. Thewitches have seceded from the Night World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie blinked. It sounded impressive the wayhe said itbut more impressive was the way Sylviafroze and then whirled breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s happened. They\u0027ve been threatening for amonth, but most people didn\u0027t believe they\u0027d reallydo it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia put a hand to her middle, pressed flatagainst her stomach as if to hold something in.Then she sat on the fur-covered bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve left the Council,\" she said. She wasn\u0027tlooking at Hunter Redfern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve left the Council and everything else.\"\"All of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter Redfern\u0027s fine red eyebrows went up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you expect? Oh, a few of the blackestpractitioners from Circle Midnight are arguing, butmost of them agree with the liberals in Circle Twilight. They want to save the humans. Avert thecoming darkness.\" He said it exactly the way Maggie had heard lumberjacks say, \"Save the spotted owls. Ha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s really beginning,\" Sylvia murmured. Shewas still looking at the stone floor. \"I mean, there\u0027sno going back, now, is there? The Night World issplit forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the millennium is upon us,\" Hunter said,almost cheerfully. He looked young and...personable, Maggie thought. Somebody you\u0027d vote for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which brings me to the question,\" he said smoothly, looking at Sylvia, \"of when you\u0027re goingto find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat her? Maggie\u0027s stomach tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia\u0027s face was equally tight. She looked up and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid levelly, \"I told you I\u0027d find her and I will.\"\"But when?You do understand how important this is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I understand!\" Sylvia flared up. Herchest was heaving. \"That\u0027s why I was trying to sendher to you in the first place-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter was talkingasif he didn\u0027t hear her. \"If it gets out that Aradia, the Maiden of all the witches,is here in the valley-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIliknow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that you hadher and let her slip throughyour fingers-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was trying to bring her to you.I thought thatwas important,\" Sylvia said. She was bristling and distraught. Which was exactly what Hunter wantedher to be, Maggie thought dazedly. He really knows how to play people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the analysis was faraway, in the shallowestpart of her mind. Most of her consciousness wassimply stricken into paralyzed amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAradia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maiden of all the witches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it wasn\u0027t Arcadia at all, Maggie thought. She might have mentioned that,after I\u0027ve been calling her Cady for days. But then she hasn\u0027t been conscious much, and when she was we had more urgent things to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAradia. Aradia. That\u0027s really pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name had started an odd resonance in hermind, maybe bringing up some long-forgotten mythology lesson. Aradia was a goddess, she thought.Of... um, sylvan glades or something. The woods.Like Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what Maiden of all the witches was, she hadno idea, but it was obviously something important.And not evil, either. From what Hunter was saying, it was clear that witches weren\u0027t like other NightPeople.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was the maiden Bern and Gavin were talkingabout, Maggie realized. The one they were supposed to deliver. So Sylvia was bringing her toHunter Redfern. But Cady herself told me-I mean, Aradiatold me-that she was already coming tothis valley for a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could even properly phrase the question, her mind had the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a coincidence that lifted the hair on Maggie\u0027sarms, Sylvia said, \"She won\u0027t get to Delos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d better not,\" Hunter said. \"Maybe you don\u0027t realize how persuasive she can be. An ambassador from all the witches, coming to plead her case ... she just might sway him. He has a despicable softspot-a conscience, you might call it. And we know he\u0027s been in contact with the human girl who escaped with her. Who knows what messages the little vermin was carrying from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo messages, Maggie thought grimly. Not withthis vermin anyway. But I would have carried themif I\u0027d known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin said Aradia was still unconscious fromthe truth potion-that she was practically dead,\"Sylvia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don t think she could have given any messages. I\u0027d swear that Delos doesn\u0027t know she\u0027sin the valley at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter was still brooding. \"The witches have oneWild Power on their side already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they won\u0027t get another,\" Sylvia said doggedly. \"I\u0027ve got people looking for her. All the nobles are on our side. They won\u0027t let her get toDelos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She should have been killed in the beginning,\"Hunter mused. \"But maybe youhave a soft spotfor herlike you do for that human boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the linen curtains, Maggie stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike you do.Not like you did.And who else couldthe human boy be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gritted her teeth, listening so hard she couldhear the blood in her ears, willing them to talkabout Miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hunter was going on in his smooth voice,\"Or maybe you still have some loyalty to thewitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia\u0027s pale face flushed. \"I do not! I\u0027m finishedwith them, and you know it! I may be a spellcaster, but I\u0027m not a witch anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you haven\u0027t forgotten whatthey\u0027ve done to you,\" Hunter said. \"After all, youcould have been a Hearth-Woman, taken yourrightful place on the witch Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like your grandmother and her mother beforeher. Theywere Harmans, and so was your father.What a pity the name isn\u0027t passed through the maleline. You ended up being just a Weald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasa Harman,\" Sylvia said with muted ferocity. She was staring at the floor again, and sheseemed to be speaking to herself rather than toHunter. \"I was. But I had to stand there and watch my cousins be accepted instead of me. I had towatch half humansbe accepted-be welcomed.They took my place-just because they were descended through the female line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter shook his head. \"A very sad tradition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia\u0027s breath came raggedly for another minuteor so, then she looked up slowly at the tall man in the center of the room, \"You don\u0027t have to worryabout my loyalty,\" she said quietly. \"I want a placein the new order after the millennium. I\u0027m through with the witches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it,\" he said, lightly and approvingly, andthen he started pacing the room. He got what hewanted out of her, Maggie thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost casually, he added, \"Just be sure thatDelos\u0027s power is kept in check until everything\u0027s decided.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia bent and lifted the basket, which Maggiehad forgotten about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The new binding spells will hold,\" she said. \"Ibrought special ingredients from one of the oldestMidnight witches. And he won\u0027t suspect anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And nobody but you can take them off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody but me,\" Sylvia said firmly. \"Not eventhe Crone of all the witches. Or the Maiden, forthat matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good girl,\" Hunter said, and smiled again. \"Ihave every confidence in you. After all, you havelamia blood in you to balance the witch taint.You\u0027re my own eighth-great-granddaughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie wanted to punch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was confused and frightened and indignantand furious, all at once. As faras she could tell,Hunter Redfern seemed to be manipulating everybody. And Delos, Delos the prince and Wild Power,was just another of his puppets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what they plan to do if he won\u0027t join their new order? she thought bleakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes, Hunter turned in his pacingand walked by the door. He paused brieflyasiflistening, then glanced at Sylvia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know how happy it makes me just to think about it,\" he said, in a voice that wasn\u0027t strained, or overly cheerful, or too loud, or anything that rang false. \"To finally have a true heir.A male heir of my own line, and untainted by witchblood. I would never have married that witchMaeve Harman if I had known my son was still alive. And not only alive, but out having sons! Theonly true Redferns left in the world, you mightsay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie, with her teeth set in her lower lip, didn\u0027tneed to guess who was on the other side of thedoor. She watched tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Delos came in, right on cue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-black-dawn-night-world-8/page-15.html","bookId":2081,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM"}
