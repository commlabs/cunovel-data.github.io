Rain isn\u0027t here and neither is Rip, who for whatever reason I thought would be, and Trent didn\u0027t show up but Blair\u0027s here with Alana and I duck out before she sees me, and then I\u0027m walking past the Buddhist cemetery where the dead are guarded by mirror-lined stupas and peacocks roam the graves and I\u0027m staring up at the Paramount water tower, through the bristling palm trees, and I\u0027m wearing a Brioni suit that had once fit but is now too loose and I keep thinking I see figures lurking behind the headstones but I tell myself it\u0027s just my imagination, taking my sunglasses off, squeezing my eyes shut. The cemetery pushes up to the back walls of the Paramount lot and you could find meaning in that or be neutral about it in the same way you could find something ironic about the endless rows of the dead lined up beneath the palm trees with their fronds blooming against a sparkling blue sky or choose not to, and I\u0027m looking at the sky thinking it\u0027s the wrong time of day for a memorial, but the day, the sunlight, chases the ghosts away and isn\u0027t that the point? They show movies here during the summer, I remember, studying the giant white wall of the mausoleum where the movies are projected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair is standing over me. I\u0027m sitting on a bench next to a tree but there\u0027s no shade and the sun is burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay,\" I say in a hopeful voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t take her sunglasses off. She\u0027s wearing a black dress that accentuates her thinness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where I\u0027m sitting I watch the dispersing crowd, their cars pulling out onto Santa Monica Boulevard, and farther away there\u0027s a bulldozer digging a fresh grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027m worried,\" I say. \"A little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asks, sounding concerned, like someone trying to comfort a child. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been questioned twice,\" I say. \"I had to hire a new lawyer.\" I pause. \"They think I\u0027m involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair doesn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say there were witnesses who saw me with him the night of his disappearance and ... \" I look away from her and don\u0027t mention that the only person I could imagine this to be true of now that I\u0027m sure the three Mexicans are dead is the doorman at the Doheny Plaza but when the doorman was interviewed he couldn\u0027t remember anything and there were no records because I\u0027d told him before Julian arrived that I was expecting a delivery and to just send up whoever stopped by, and all I\u0027ve done is deny everything and tell everyone that I might have seen Julian earlier that week but the fact remains I don\u0027t have an alibi for the night I drove him to the corner of Finley and Commonwealth and I know Rip Millar and Rain both know this. \"Which means ... well, I don\u0027t know what it means,\" I murmur, and then try to smile. \"A lot of things, I guess.\" The Hollywood sign blares from the hills and a helicopter flies low over the cemetery and a small group dressed in black is wandering through the headstones. I\u0027ve only been here for fifteen minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Blair starts haltingly, \"if you didn\u0027t do anything, why are you worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They think I might have been part of ... a plan,\" I say casually. \"I actually heard the word \u0027conspiracy\u0027 used.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can they prove?\" she asks softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have a tape someone thinks is incriminating ... this ... this drunken rant I made at Julian one night and ... \" I stop. \"Well, I was sleeping with his girlfriend so ... \" I look up at her and then away. \"I think I know who\u0027s involved and I think they\u0027re going to get away with it ... but no one knows where I was.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-50.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
