That type of stuff is important to me, but if Abby bothers you, then I’ll make sure she keeps her distance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch the curved piece he added to the engine. “Did you really meet her inside a Dumpster?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he doesn’t answer immediately, I sneak a peek out of the corner of my eye. His hands are on his hips as he stares at the floor. “Yeah. We were both looking for food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes as my heart aches. I can’t imagine what his life has been like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want your pity,” he says with a mix of hurt and pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not offering you pity.” Understanding hopefully, not pity. It’s not much, and it’s not nearly on the same level, but it still causes me enough pain that I can’t face him. “I don’t have friends. I have my brothers, and there are some girls at school that I can sit with at lunch if I want to, but they don’t get bent out of shape if I don’t show. I’m...I’m weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis boots tap against the floor as he moves in my direction. “No, you’re not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffen, irritated and tired of everyone telling me what I am. “How many girls do you know who work on cars, like speed and can happily tell you what a cold air intake looks like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah places his fingers underneath my chin and tilts my head in his direction. “Only one, and she’s my type of girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flurry of rose petals swirls in my chest. I swallow and remind myself to breathe. He lowers his head as I lick my lips. His warm breath mingles with mine and right as our lips come close to connecting, the garage door squeaks open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinch as if jolted with electricity and immediately slide a foot away from Isaiah. He softly chuckles. An audience obviously wouldn’t bother him. I toss him a dirty look that only makes him chuckle more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got company,” says Abby. Right behind her is the guy that showed with that girl Beth. My hand goes to my stomach as it cramps. Isaiah and the guy share a short shake. “Logan, remember Rachel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods at me. “What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.” My eyes flicker from him to the door as I keep waiting for her to show. A strange uneasiness curls between my skin and bones. Beautiful, confident, mysterious Beth: the antithesis of me and everything a guy like Isaiah should want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week, Isaiah explained how Logan will race his car while Isaiah drives my car at the dragway. The better parts will go into my car since it’s in better condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah never mentioned anything about Beth helping, and I never asked. After Isaiah announced that she wasn’t his girlfriend, I thought I could let her go, but the uncertainty of what his relationship was with her before I crashed into his life gnaws at my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah claps his hands then rubs them together. “We’ve got a turbocharger, a cold air intake, an exhaust cutout to install and a girl with a curfew. Let’s move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith anxiety coiled and poised to spring on a moment’s notice, I digress to a bad habit: nibbling on my nails. I used to bite, but then my mother would have an aneurysm when she’d see what I’d done to my manicure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be right beside Isaiah and Logan as they work on my car, but I can’t. Being in the same room is bad enough. How can anyone watch surgery being performed on a loved one, much less hold the scalpel? Isaiah pushes a button and the lift’s ear-crushing whine accompanies the sight of my car floating into the air. The turbocharger is in. Now he’s installing the cutout to the muffler. Once this is done, my baby will never sound the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” says Abby. “What do best friends do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of like a cartoon character, I whip my head back and forth from Abby to the lift. She’s been next to me during the whole ordeal, sharing strange broken conversations about nothing. “What do you mean?” By best friends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never been to the mall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she gained my full attention. “Never?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby twirls the string attached to her hoodie. “Well, yeah, I’ve gone for work, but never to hang. Are you one of those girls? The ones that go to the mall? I think I could do it. Wander the mall for no reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why haven’t you?” I don’t feel like answering that I don’t hang at malls. Most of the girls I know think my hatred of all things retail is weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wraps the string tightly around her finger three times. “Malls are expensive, and as I said before, I don’t do friendships.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides Isaiah,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides him,” she agrees. “And you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why me?” It’s a bold question to ask, but everything about this girl is bold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” she answers. When neither one of us say anything for a while she finally continues, “Because you like Isaiah. If you like him, then maybe you can like me. Besides, I like bunnies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try not to smile. A strange answer, yet normal for her. We watch as the two guys tinker with the underside of my car. Actually, Abby observes, I avoid looking. “Where do you work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby pulls hard on her string, causing it to become uneven. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the mall,” I prompt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scratches her mouth as if attempting to hide the uneven smirk. “I don’t work at the mall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mull over what she said earlier. No, she said...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I make deliveries to people at the mall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” She must sell cosmetics or something like that. “So you have a home business?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s the guy with Isaiah? Is he a friend of yours? He’s hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. He’s Beth’s friend.” A twinge of jealousy rattles my bones. Abby’s sneakers squeak when she kicks at a nonexistent spot on the floor. While I’ve never asked Isaiah about Beth, Isaiah’s also never offered information. Maybe Abby can fill me in on Beth since Isaiah is closemouthed. “Do you know Beth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot helpful. “Were you friends with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell no. She twisted Isaiah so damn tight even I couldn’t breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overhead heater clicks three times as we all groan. Isaiah turned it off earlier, but we all began to freeze. Cold fingers aren’t good for my baby so he powered it back on. Isaiah swears as he yanks off his T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart trips. Last night, I dreamed of touching his body. “He has a lot of tattoos,” I say, hoping Abby doesn’t notice how I stare at Isaiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” she replies. “He got his first one, the tiger, when we were fourteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. “Does it mean something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t know. Isaiah won’t discuss his tattoos. He gets them and moves on.” “Paint It Black” plays from her cell. Abby presses a hand to her forehead. “I’ve gotta split.” And she disappears, leaving me alone with my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had Isaiah twisted so damn tight even I couldn’t breathe. Abby’s words circle in my mind. What was an attempt to make me feel better has progressed to nausea tearing at my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whistle draws my attention. Isaiah flashes the craziest smile I’ve ever seen. “Almost done, angel. You’re going to love how she’ll sing for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time when I smile, I have to force the muscles to comply. How can I compete with Beth—the girl who kept, possibly still keeps, him twisted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE GODS ARE ON OUR side. The weather’s warm—upper fifties—with clear skies predicted for this Saturday night. With my hip cocked against Rachel’s car, I assess the Camaro pulling beside me in the waiting lane behind the grandstand. The big-ass dragsters are having their turn in the lanes. Next will be the street cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel stands near the hood petting her car like the pony it is. “Promise you won’t wreck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take care of your car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isaiah, I’m worried about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout me? My heart stalls in my chest. Rachel, Logan and I checked out a few races before we signed in and unfortunately, we witnessed a wreck. No one hurt, but it totaled the cars. Rachel’s face faded into an unnatural shade of white when an older guy mumbled how the rules enforced at the track were written by the blood of other generations. Since then, when Rachel’s watched the races, I think all she sees are ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet her violet eyes. “I’ll be okay, Rachel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowers her head, raises it, then lets it fall back. I can’t read her very well and I wish I could. “What’s going on in your head?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel sucks in a breath to answer right as the driver of the Camaro slides out. Doing what I asked of her earlier when a possible bet came into the picture, she walks straight for the grandstands. Her long hair swings forward, hiding her face. My legs twitch with the desire to follow her, kiss her and ask what’s wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rachel arrived at the garage yesterday, she was one hundred percent with me, but by the time I finished her car, she became distant again. I’ll dig for the issues tonight. Now I need to focus and win us money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance behind me at Logan. He’s already deep in conversation with his competition: a Dodge Charger. That’ll be a nice race for Logan. That driver always jumps the green light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Camaro driver appreciates Rachel’s car. “When did you upgrade?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe may not know my name, but he recognizes me by my old car. I’m the same with him. “This week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still think you can take me?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods to his car. “I’ve made some updates, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not concerned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I hoped, he produces a wad of cash from his pocket. “Then you won’t mind putting money on the table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I wouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 40\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY FINGERS KNOT AROUND THE cold metal fence as I watch Isaiah drive my car to the burnout area. The accident we saw occurred a second after the race began. A tire blew, causing the driver to lose control and ram into the side of a Chevy Comet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt scared the crap out of me—especially when a burst of flame shot out one of the cars. Men scrambled over the barricades, hauling the drivers to safety, spraying fire extinguishers at the hood. Isaiah went to launch himself over the fence to help, but my grip on his arm stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him. He looked down at me. And when my body began to tremble, he placed an arm around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah drives past the waterline, jerking me back to the present, and he immediately heads to the staging area. The unexpected move paralyzes the anxiety spiders crawling in my stomach. “Why isn’t he doing a burnout?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the car doesn’t have slicks,” says Zach as he approaches me and leans an arm on the fence. His blond hair shags over his face. “Street cars typically avoid burnouts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Slicks are a type of tire that sticks better to the tracks. Zach was nice last weekend, but he reminds me of the guys from my school—how he speaks, knows everyone, and how he has plenty of the girls vying for him. So, in other words, he puts me on edge, and I slip back into Rachel mode. I step away from him when he invades my personal space. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-33.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
