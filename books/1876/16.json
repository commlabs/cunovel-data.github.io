{"id":83045,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe shoot the next morning feels tense. Cole\u0027s out of sorts and silent. I speak for him, and take over the shoot without him asking me to. At one point he hands me the camera. \"Time to show off, Lamore. Do your best. I have what I need.\" Cole moves to the back of the room and presses a button. Regina shows up and he disappears into the back, out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe client is patient. She knows of Cole and his work, and she trusts him. She doesn\u0027t bat an eye at Cole handing the shoot over to me, which makes me even more nervous. Why does everyone think I can do this but me? After a few poses I feel less nervous. I start to see what I want to shoot and I forget that I haven\u0027t shot on my own yet. I don\u0027t worry about Cole yelling at me for messing up the session. He trusts me, maybe too much. I glance around wondering where he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe client and I chat about lots of things until she asks, \"Has Cole shot you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer question takes me by surprise. I nod shyly, my cheeks flaming, \"As a matter of fact, he has. Although I haven\u0027t seen the results yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins, \"I hope you show off his work. There\u0027s something about the mind of an artist like Cole. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s like he\u0027s broken and it just makes me want to fix him. At the same time, if he weren\u0027t so messed up, he couldn\u0027t create such beautiful work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs lightly and I stare at her. Is that what draws me to him? Cole\u0027s broken. He was abandoned by his parents, leading life totally alone - a life that no one knows about. Cole has been on his own since he was eighteen, since that picture of him in the army uniform. And now something else is happening to him, something that is weighing on him. She is right. I want to fix it. I want to let Cole know he\u0027s not alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe session continues and I steer the conversation away from Cole. Although I don\u0027t know where he\u0027s gone, I\u0027m not sure if he can hear us. And a level of protectiveness washes over me when she talks about him like that. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s tormenting Cole, but I can\u0027t make light of it the way she does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she leaves, I try to find Cole, but I only see Regina. After the client leaves, Regina moves to the front desk to answer the phone and return calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell did Cole go?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me, \"I tried to ask, but he took off without a word. He looked pissed, Anna. What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWide-eyed, I say, \"Nothing. We were shooting, and then he shoved the camera in my hands and walked out. I didn\u0027t do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritated, I push through the front door and walk outside into the afternoon air. The salty smell of the ocean fills my lungs as I walk down the path behind the studio. My heart falls into my shoes when I see him. He\u0027s sitting on a bench between two massive pines with his head in his hands, shoulders hunched toward the ground like he\u0027s utterly defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m certain he knows I\u0027m there by the time I step next to him, but he doesn\u0027t move. To see him like this consumes me with grief. It feels like there are two hands on my throat, pressing away the air. I slip onto the bench next to him. Looking at the scattered pines that stand between us and the ocean, I ask, \"How long did it take you to pick this property for the studio? You wanted it for a while, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t move. After a minute, he turns his face slowly toward me, \"How\u0027d you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"It just seems like you\u0027re familiar with this place in a way that someone who\u0027s been here before would be. Maybe more than once.\" He smiles but it fades too fast. He rubs his hands through his hair and sits up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came here a few times when I was younger. I told myself that if it went up for sale, that I\u0027d get it. Everything about this place reminds me of things I love.\" He shrugs. \"I didn\u0027t think I was that transparent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not,\" I reply. He arches a brow at me like he doesn\u0027t believe me. \"That\u0027s the only thing that I figured out and I wasn\u0027t even sure I was right. \"So, do you want to tell me why you walked out of the shoot?\" He blinks once at me and returns his gaze to the ground. The expression clearly says NO. \"Okay,\" I say, \"Well, at least tell me you\u0027re leaving next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There won\u0027t be a next time,\" he says and glances over at me, \"I\u0027m going back to the city. You can do this. I don\u0027t need me to be here anymore. Besides, there\u0027s something that came up and it would be easier to deal with if I were at Le Femme and not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth hangs open and I try to snap it shut, but shock washes over me too quickly. After one solo shoot out here, he\u0027s leaving? Cole says nothing else. I don\u0027t know what to say. It feels like I should be excited, but I\u0027m not. Everything feels wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, it\u0027s just me and Regina?\" He nods and doesn\u0027t look up. His gaze is on the ground, on the pebble path beneath his feet. \"Cole,\" he lifts his head and looks at me. I want to take him in my arms and hold him. \"You don\u0027t have to be alone.\" He laughs when I say it, but it sounds so tormented that I want to cry. \"I\u0027m serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not an option for some people, Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I say and his dark laughter gets cut short. \"Let\u0027s accept it. You and I are alone. We rely on no one. We sleep alone, if we sleep at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you getting at?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that life doesn\u0027t have to be so damn lonely.\" My eyes meet his and I can\u0027t look away. Those endless pools of blue pin me in place. Inside my mind I\u0027m pleading with him, begging him to let me in, but I say nothing. There\u0027s nothing more to say. Standing, I turn to him and rest my hand on his shoulder, and pause. There are so many things I want to say. I feel the words in my mouth, but I say none of them. My hand slips off his shoulder. I walk away and Cole lets me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-16.html","bookId":1876,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM"}
