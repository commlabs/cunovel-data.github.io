She knew they were being taken to death in the desert. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane put down the report and smiled. \"So she ordered the prisoners brought back to her. I find her choice of words fascinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring them back?\" Kipuna asked. \"That seems a simple enough order. How is it fascinating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane admired the directness of the acolyte\u0027s interest. Kipuna was not about to pass up a chance at learning how a real Reverend Mother\u0027s mind worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not that part of her performance that interested me,\" Tamalane said. She bent to the report, reading aloud: \" \u0027You are servants unto Shaitan, not servants unto servants.\u0027 \" Tamalane looked up at Kipuna. \"You saw and heard all of this yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Reverend Mother. It was judged important that I report to you personally should you have other questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She still calls him Shaitan,\" Tamalane said. \"How that must gall them! Of course, the Tyrant himself said it: \u0027They will call me Shaitan.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen the reports out of the hoard found at Dar-es-Balat,\" Kipuna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no delay in bringing back the two prisoners?\" Tamalane asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As quickly as a message could be transmitted to the \u0027thopter, Reverend Mother. They were returned within minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they are watching her and listening all the time. Good. Did Sheeana give any sign that she knew the two prisoners? Did any message pass between them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sure they were strangers to her, Reverend Mother. Two ordinary people of the lower orders, rather dirty and poorly clothed. They smelled of the unwashed from the perimeter hovels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana ordered the manacles removed and then she spoke to this unwashed pair. Her exact words now: What did she say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027You are my people.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely, lovely,\" Tamalane said. \"Sheeana then ordered that these two be taken away, bathed and given new clothes before being released. Tell me in your own words what happened next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She summoned Tuek who came with three of his councillor-attendants. It was... almost an argument.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Memory-trance, please,\" Tamalane said. \"Replay the exchange for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKipuna closed her eyes, breathed deeply and fell into memory-trance. Then: \"Sheeana says, \u0027I do not like it when you feed my people to Shaitan.\u0027 Councillor Stiros says, \u0027They are sacrificed to Shai-hulud!\u0027 Sheeana says, \u0027To Shaitan!\u0027 Sheeana stamps her foot in anger. Tuek says, \u0027Enough, Stiros. I will not hear more of this dissension.\u0027 Sheeana says, \u0027When will you learn?\u0027 Stiros starts to speak but Tuek silences him with a glare and says, \u0027We have learned, Holy Child.\u0027 Sheeana says, \u0027I want -\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough,\" Tamalane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe acolyte opened her eyes and waited silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, Tamalane said, \"Return to your post, Kipuna. You have done very well, indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Reverend Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be consternation among the priests,\" Tamalane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana\u0027s wish is their command because Tuek believes in her. They will stop using the worms as instruments of punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two prisoners,\" Kipuna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, very observant of you. The two prisoners will tell what happened to them. The story will be distorted. People will say that Sheeana protects them from the priests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that exactly what she\u0027s doing, Reverend Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhhh, but consider the options open to the priests. They will increase their alternative forms of punishment - whippings and certain deprivations. While fear of Shaitan eases because of Sheeana, fear of the priests will increase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin two months, Tamalane\u0027s reports to Chapter House contained confirmation of her own words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short rations, especially short water rations, have become the dominant form of punishment,\" Tamalane reported. \"Wild rumors have penetrated the farthest reaches of Rakis and soon will find lodging on many other planets as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane considered the implications of her report with care. Many eyes would see it, including some not in sympathy with Taraza. Any Reverend Mother would be able to call up an image of what must be happening on Rakis. Many on Rakis had seen Sheeana\u0027s arrival atop a wild worm from the desert. The priestly response of secrecy had been flawed from the beginning. Curiosity unsatisfied tended to create its own answers. Guesses were often more dangerous than facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrevious reports had told of the children brought to play with Sheeana. The much-garbled stories of such children were repeated with increasing distortions and those distortions had been dutifully sent on to Chapter House. The two prisoners, returned to the streets in their new finery, only compounded the growing mythology. The Sisterhood, artists in mythology, possessed on Rakis a ready-made energy to be subtly amplified and directed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have fed a wish-fulfillment belief into the populace,\" Tamalane reported. She thought of the Bene Gesserit-originated phrases as she reread her latest report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana is the one we have long awaited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a simple enough statement that its meaning could be spread without unacceptable distortion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Child of Shai-hulud comes to chastise the priests!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one had been a bit more complicated. A few priests died in dark alleys as a result of popular fervency. This had fed a new alertness into the corps of priestly enforcers with predictable injustices inflicted upon the populace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane thought of the priestly delegation that had waited upon Sheeana as a result of turmoil among Tuek\u0027s councillors. Seven of them led by Stiros had intruded upon Sheeana\u0027s luncheon with a child from the streets. Knowing that this would happen Tamalane had been prepared and a secret recording of the incident had been brought to her, the words audible, every expression visible, the thoughts quite apparent to a Reverend Mother\u0027s trained eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were sacrificing to Shai-hulud!\" Stiros protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tuek told you not to argue with me about that,\" Sheeana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the priestesses smiled at the discomfiture of Stiros and the other priests!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Shai-hulud -\" Stiros began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaitan!\" Sheeana corrected him and her expression was easily read: Did these stupid priests know nothing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we have always thought -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wrong!\" Sheeana stamped a foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros feigned the need for instruction. \"Are we to believe that Shai-hulud, the Divided God, is also Shaitan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a complete fool he was, Tamalane thought. Even a pubescent girl could confound him, as Sheeana proceeded to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any child of the streets knows this almost as soon as she can walk!\" Sheeana ranted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros spoke slyly: \"How do you know what is in the minds of street children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are evil to doubt me!\" Sheeana accused. It was an answer she had learned to use often, knowing it would get back to Tuek and cause trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros knew this only too well. He waited with downcast eyes while Sheeana, speaking with heavy patience as one telling an old fable to a child, explained to him that either god or devil or both could inhabit the worm of the desert. Humans had only to accept this. It was not left to humans to decide such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros had sent people into the desert for speaking such heresy. His expression (so carefully recorded for Bene Gesserit analysis) said such wild concepts were always springing up from the muck at the bottom of the Rakian heap. But now! He had to contend with Tuek\u0027s insistence that Sheeana spoke gospel truth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she looked at the recording, Tamalane thought the pot was boiling nicely. This she reported to Chapter House. Doubts flogged Stiros; doubts everywhere except among the populace in their devotion to Sheeana. Spies close to Tuek said he was even beginning to doubt the wisdom of his decision to translate the historian-locutor, Dromind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was Dromind right to doubt her?\" Tuek demanded of those around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible!\" the sycophants said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else could they say? The High Priest could make no mistake in such decisions. God would not allow it. Sheeana clearly confounded him, though. She put the decisions of many previous High Priests into a terrible limbo. Reinterpretation was being demanded on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros kept pounding at Tuek: \"What do we really know about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane had a full account of the most recent such confrontation. Stiros and Tuek alone, debating far into the night, just the two of them (they thought) in Tuek\u0027s quarters, comfortably ensconced in rare blue chairdogs, melange-laced confits close at hand. Tamalane\u0027s holophoto record of the meeting showed a single yellow glowglobe drifting on its suspensors close above the pair, the light dimmed to ease the strain on tired eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps that first time, leaving her in the desert with a thumper, was not a good test,\" Stiros said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a sly statement. Tuek was noted for not having an excessively complicated mind. \"Not a good test? Whatever do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God might wish us to perform other tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have seen her yourself! Many times in the desert talking to God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Stiros almost pounced. Clearly, it was the response he wanted. \"If she can stand unharmed in the presence of God, perhaps she can teach others how this is accomplished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know this angers her when we suggest it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we have not approached the problem in quite the right way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stiros! What if the child is right? We serve the Divided God. I have been thinking long and earnestly upon this. Why would God divide? Is this not God\u0027s ultimate test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression on Stiros\u0027 face said this was exactly the kind of mental gymnastics his faction feared. He tried to divert the High Priest but Tuek was not to be shifted from a single-track plunge into metaphysics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ultimate test,\" Tuek insisted. \"To see the good in evil and the evil in good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros\u0027 expression could only be described as consternation. Tuek was God\u0027s Supreme Anointed. No priest was allowed to doubt that! The thing that might now arise if Tuek went public with such a concept would shake the foundations of priestly authority! Clearly, Stiros was asking himself if the time had not come to translate his High Priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never suggest that I might debate such profound ideas with my High Priest,\" Stiros said. \"But perhaps I can offer a proposal that might resolve many doubts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Propose then,\" Tuek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Subtle instruments could be introduced in her clothing. We might listen when she talks to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think God would not know what we did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such a thought never crossed my mind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not order her taken into the desert,\" Tuek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if it is her own idea to go?\" Stiros assumed his most ingratiating expression. \"She has done this many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not recently. She appears to have lost her need to consult with God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could we not offer suggestions to her?\" Stiros asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana, when will you speak again with your Father? Do you not long to stand once more in His presence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has more the sound of prodding than suggestion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am only proposing that -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Holy Child is no simpleton! She talks to God, Stiros. God might punish us sorely for such presumption.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did God not put her here for us to study?\" Stiros asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was too close to the Dromind heresy for Tuek\u0027s liking. He sent a baleful stare at Stiros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I mean,\" Stiros said, \"is that surely God means us to learn from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuek himself had said this many times, never hearing in his own words a curious echo of Dromind\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is not to be prodded and tested,\" Tuek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heaven forbid!\" Stiros said. \"I will be the soul of holy caution. And everything I learn from the Holy Child will be reported to you immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuek merely nodded. He had his own ways to be sure Stiros spoke the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subsequent sly proddings and testings were reported immediately to Chapter House by Tamalane and her subordinates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana has a thoughtful look,\" Tamalane reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the Reverend Mothers on Rakis and those to whom they reported, this thoughtful look had an obvious interpretation. Sheeana\u0027s antecedents had been deduced long ago. Stiros\u0027 intrusions were making the child homesick. Sheeana kept a wise silence but she clearly thought much about her life in a pioneer village. Despite all of the fears and perils, those obviously had been happy times for her. She would remember the laughter, poling the sand for its weather, hunting scorpions in the crannies of the village hovels, smelling out spice fragments in the dunes. From Sheeana\u0027s repeated trips to the area, the Sisterhood had made a reasonably accurate guess as to the location of the lost village and what had happened to it. Sheeana often stared at one of Tuek\u0027s old maps on the wall of her quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tamalane expected, one morning Sheeana stabbed a finger at the place on the wall map where she had gone many times. \"Take me there,\" Sheeana commanded her attendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \u0027thopter was summoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile priests listened avidly in a \u0027thopter hovering far overhead, Sheeana once more confronted her nemesis in the sand. Tamalane and her advisors, tuned into the priestly circuits, observed just as avidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing even remotely suggesting a village remained on the duneswept waste where Sheeana ordered herself deposited. She used a thumper this time however. Another of Stiros\u0027 sly suggestions accompanied by careful instructions on use of the ancient means to summon the Divided God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA worm came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane watched on her own relay projector, thinking the worm only a middling monster. Its length she estimated at about fifty meters. Sheeana stood only about three meters in front of the gaping mouth. The huffing of the worm\u0027s interior fires was clearly audible to the observers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you tell me why you did it?\" Sheeana demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not flinch from the worm\u0027s hot breath. Sand crackled beneath the monster but she gave no sign that she heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me!\" Sheeana commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo voice came from the worm but Sheeana appeared to be listening, her head cocked to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go back where you came from,\" Sheeana said. She waved the worm away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObediently, the worm backed off and returned beneath the sands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor days, while the Sisterhood spied upon them with glee, the priests debated that sparse encounter. Sheeana could not be questioned lest she learn that she had been overheard. As before, she refused to discuss anything about her visits to the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros continued his sly prodding. The result was precisely what the Sisterhood expected. Without any warning, Sheeana would awaken some days and say: \"Today, I will go into the desert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes she used a thumper, sometimes she danced her summons. Far out on the sands beyond the sight of Keen or any other inhabited place, the worms came to her. Sheeana alone in front of a worm talked to it while others listened. Tamalane found the accumulated recordings fascinating as they passed through her hands on their way to Chapter House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should hate you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a turmoil that caused among the priests! Tuek wanted an open debate: \"Should all of us hate the Divided God at the same time we love Him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros barely shut off this suggestion with the argument that God\u0027s wishes had not been made clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheeana asked one of her gigantic visitors: \"Will you let me ride you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she approached, the worm retreated and would not let her mount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn another occasion, she asked: \"Must I stay with the priests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis particular worm proved to be the target of many questions, and among them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do people go when you eat them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are people false to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I punish the bad priests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane laughed at that final question, thinking of the turmoil it would cause among Tuek\u0027s people. Her spies duly reported the dismay of the priests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does He answer her?\" Tuek asked. \"Has anyone heard God respond?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps He speaks directly into her soul,\" a councillor ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it!\" Tuek leaped at this offering. \"We must ask her what God tells her to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheeana refused to be drawn into such discussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has a pretty fair assessment of her powers,\" Tamalane reported. \"She\u0027s not going into the desert very much now despite Stiros\u0027 proddings. As we might expect, the attraction has waned. Fear and elation will carry her just so far before paling. She has, however, learned an effective command:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sisterhood marked this as an important development. When even the Divided God obeyed, no priest or priestess was about to question her authority to issue such a command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The priests are building towers in the desert,\" Tamalane reported. \"They want more secure places from which to observe Sheeana when she does go out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sisterhood had anticipated this development and had even done some of its own prodding to speed up the projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach tower had its own windtrap, its own maintenance staff, its own water barrier, gardens and other elements of civilization. Each was a small community spreading the established areas of Rakis farther and farther into the domain of the worms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePioneer villages no longer were necessary and Sheeana got the credit for this development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is our priestess,\" the populace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuek and his councillors spun on the point of a pin: Shaitan and Shai-hulud in one body? Stiros lived in daily fear that Tuek would announce the fact. Stiros\u0027 advisors finally rejected the suggestion that Tuek be translated. Another suggestion that Priestess Sheeana have a fatal accident was greeted with horror by all, even Stiros finding it too great a venture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if we remove this thorn, God may visit us with an even more terrible intrusion,\" he said. And he warned: \"The oldest books say that a little child shall lead us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStiros was only the most recent among those who looked upon Sheeana as something not quite mortal. It was observable that those around her, Cania included, had come to love Sheeana. She was so ingenuous, so bright and responsive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany observed that this growing affection for Sheeana extended even to Tuek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the people touched by this power, the Sisterhood had an immediate recognition. The Bene Gesserit knew a label for this ancient effect: expanding worship. Tamalane reported profound changes moving through Rakis as people everywhere on the planet began praying to Sheeana instead of to Shaitan or even to Shai-hulud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They see that Sheeana intercedes for the weakest people,\" Tamalane reported. \"It is a familiar pattern. All goes as ordered. When do you send the ghola?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outer surface of a balloon is always larger than the center of the damned thing! That\u0027s the whole point of the Scattering!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Bene Gesserit response to an Ixian suggestion that new investigative probes be sent out among the Lost Ones\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Sisterhood\u0027s swifter lighters took Miles Teg up to the Guild Transport circling Gammu. He did not like leaving the Keep at this moment but the priorities were obvious. He also had a gut reaction about this venture. In his three centuries of experience, Teg had learned to trust his gut reactions. Matters were not going well on Gammu. Every patrol, every report of remote sensors, the accounts of Patrin\u0027s spies in the cities - everything fueled Teg\u0027s disquiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentat fashion, Teg felt the movement of forces around the Keep and within it. His ghola charge was threatened. The order for him to report aboard the Guild Transport prepared for violence, however, came from Taraza herself with an unmistakable crypto-identifier on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the lighter taking him upward, Teg set himself for battle. Those preparations he could make had been made. Lucilla was warned. He felt confident about Lucilla. Schwangyu was another matter. He fully intended to discuss with Taraza a few essential changes in the Gammu Keep. First, though, he had another battle to win. Teg had not the slightest doubt that he was entering combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his lighter moved in to dock, Teg looked out a port and saw the gigantic Ixian symbol within the Guild cartouche on the Transport\u0027s dark side. This was a ship the Guild had converted to Ixian mechanism, substituting machines for the traditional navigator. There would be Ixian technicians aboard to service the equipment. A genuine Guild navigator would be there, too. The Guild had never quite learned to trust a machine even while they paraded these converted Transports as a message to Tleilaxu and Rakians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see: we do not absolutely require your melange!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the announcement contained in that giant symbol of Ix on the spaceship\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg felt the slight lurch of the docking grapples and took a deep, quieting breath. He felt as he always did just before battle: Empty of all false dreams. This was a failure. The talking had failed and now came the contest of blood... unless he could prevail in some other way. Combat these days was seldom a massive thing but death was there nonetheless. That represented a more permanent kind of failure. If we cannot adjust our differences peacefully we are less than human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attendant with the unmistakable signs of Ix in his speech guided Teg to the room where Taraza waited. All along the corridors and in the pneumotubes carrying him to Taraza, Teg looked for signs to confirm the secret warning in the Mother Superior\u0027s message. All seemed serene and ordinary - the attendant properly deferential toward the Bashar. \"I was a Tireg commander at Andioyu,\" the attendant said, naming one of the almost-battles where Teg had prevailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to an ordinary oval hatch in the wall of an ordinary corridor. The hatch opened and Teg entered a white-walled room of comfortable dimensions - sling chairs, low side tables, glowglobes tuned to yellow. The hatch slid into its seals behind him with a solid thump, leaving his guide behind him in the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Bene Gesserit acolyte parted the gossamer hangings that concealed a passage on Teg\u0027s right. She nodded to him. He had been seen. Taraza would be notified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg suppressed a trembling in his calf muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViolence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not misinterpreted Taraza\u0027s secret warning. Were his preparations adequate? There was a black sling chair at his left, a long table in front of it and another chair at the end of the table. Teg went to this side of the room and waited with his back to the wall. The brown dust of Gammu still clung to his boot toes, he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeculiar smell in the room. He sniffed. Shere! Had Taraza and her people armed themselves against an Ixian Probe? Teg had taken his usual shere capsule before embarking on the lighter. Too much knowledge in his head that might be useful to an enemy. The fact that Taraza left the smell of shere around her quarters had another implication: It was a statement to some observer whose presence she could not prevent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza entered through the gossamer hangings. She appeared tired, he thought. He found this remarkable because the Sisters were capable of concealing fatigue until almost ready to drop. Was she actually low in energy or was this another gesture for hidden observers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing just into the room, Taraza studied Teg. The Bashar appeared much older than when she had last seen him, Taraza thought. Duty on Gammu was having its effect, but she found this reassuring. Teg was doing his job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your quick response is appreciated, Miles,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppreciated! Their agreed word for \"We are being watched secretly by a dangerous foe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg nodded while his gaze went to the hangings where Taraza had entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza smiled and moved farther into the room. No signs of the melange cycle in Teg, she observed. Teg\u0027s advanced years always raised the suspicion that he might resort to the leavening effect of the spice. Nothing about him revealed even the faintest hint of the melange addiction that even the strongest sometimes turned to when they felt their end approaching. Teg wore his old uniform jacket of Supreme Bashar but without the gold starbursts at shoulder and collar. This was a signal she recognized. He said: \"Remember how I earned this in your service. I have not failed you this time, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes that studied her were level; no hint of judgment escaped them. His entire appearance spoke of quiet within, everything at variance with what she knew must be occurring in him at this moment. He awaited her signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our ghola must be awakened at the first opportunity,\" she said. She waved a hand to silence him as he started to respond. \"I have seen Lucilla\u0027s reports and I know he is too young. But we are required to act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke for the watchers, he realized. Were her words to be believed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I now give you the order to awaken him,\" she said and she flexed her left wrist in the confirmation gesture of their secret language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true! Teg glanced at the hangings that concealed the passage where Taraza had entered. Who was it listening there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his Mentat talents to the problem. There were missing pieces but that did not stop him. A Mentat could work without certain pieces if he had enough to create a pattern. Sometimes, the sketchiest outline was enough. It supplied the hidden shape and then he could fit the missing pieces to complete a whole. Mentats seldom had all the data they might desire, but he was trained to sense patterns, to recognize systems and wholeness. Teg reminded himself now that he also had been trained in the ultimate military sense: You trained a recruit to train a weapon, to aim the weapon correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza was aiming him. His assessment of their situation had been confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Desperate attempts will be made to kill or capture our ghola before you can awaken him,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized her tone: the coldly analytic offering of data to a Mentat. She saw that he was in Mentat mode, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mentat pattern-search rolled through his mind. First, there was the Sisterhood\u0027s design for the ghola, largely unknown to him, but ranging somehow around the presence of a young female on Rakis who (so they said) could command worms. Idaho gholas: charming persona and with something else that had made the Tyrant and the Tleilaxu repeat him countless times. Duncans by the shipload! What service did this ghola provide that the Tyrant had not let him remain among the dead? And the Tleilaxu: They had decanted Duncan Idaho gholas from their axlotl tanks for millennia, even after the death of the Tyrant. The Tleilaxu had sold this ghola to the Sisterhood twelve times and the Sisterhood had paid in the hardest currency: melange from their own precious stores. Why did the Tleilaxu accept in payment something they produced so copiously? Obvious: to deplete the Sisterhood\u0027s supplies. A special form of greed there. The Tleilaxu were buying supremacy - a power game!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg focused on the quietly waiting Mother Superior. \"The Tleilaxu have been killing our gholas to control our timing,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza nodded but did not speak. So there was more. Once again, he fell into Mentat mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bene Gesserit were a valuable market for the Tleilaxu melange, not the only source because there was always the trickle from Rakis, but valuable, yes; very valuable. It was not reasonable that the Tleilaxu would alienate a valuable market unless they had a more valuable market standing ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho else had an interest in Bene Gesserit activities? The Ixians without a doubt. But Ixians were not a good market for melange. The Ixian presence on this ship spoke of their independence. Since Ixians and Fish Speakers made common cause, the Fish Speakers could be set aside from this pattern quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat great power or assemblage of powers in this universe possessed...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg froze that thought as though he had applied the dive brakes in a \u0027thopter, letting his mind float free while he sorted other considerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot in this universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pattern took shape. Wealth. Gammu assumed a new role in his Mentat computations. Gammu had been gutted long ago by the Harkonnens, abandoned as a festering carcass, which the Danians had restored. There was a time, though, when even Gammu\u0027s hopes were gone. Without hopes there had not even been dreams. Climbing from that cesspool, the population had employed only the basest pragmatism. If it works, it is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his first survey of Gammu he had noted the numbers of banking houses. They were even marked, some of them, as Bene Gesserit - safe. Gammu served as the fulcrum for manipulation of enormous wealth. The bank he had visited to study its use as an emergency contact came back fully into his Mentat awareness. He had realized at once that the place did not confine itself to purely planetary business. It was a bankers\u0027 bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot just wealth but WEALTH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Prime Pattern development did not come into Teg\u0027s mind but he had enough for a Testing Projection. Wealth not of this universe. People from the Scattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this Mentat sorting had taken only a few seconds. Having reached a testing point, Teg set himself loose-of-muscle and nerve, glanced once at Taraza and strode across to the concealed entry. He noted that, Taraza gave no sign of alarm at his movements. Whipping aside the hangings, Teg confronted a man almost as tall as himself: military-style clothing with crossed spears at the collar tabs. The face was heavy, the jaws wide; green eyes. A look of surprised alertness, one hand poised above a pocket that bulged obviously with a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg smiled at the man, let the hangings fall and returned to Taraza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are being observed by people from the Scattering,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaraza relaxed. Teg\u0027s performance had been memorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hangings swished aside. The tall stranger entered and stopped about two paces from Teg. A glacial expression of anger gripped his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warned you not to tell him!\" The voice was a grating baritone with an accent new to Teg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I warned you about the powers of this Mentat Bashar,\" Taraza said. A look of loathing flashed across her features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man subsided and a subtle look of fear came over his face. \"Honored Matre, I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare call me that!\" Taraza\u0027s body tensed in a fighting posture that Teg had never before seen her display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man inclined his head slightly. \"Dear lady, you do not control the situation here. I must remind you that my orders -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg had heard enough. \"Through me, she does control here,\" he said. \"Before coming here I set certain protective measures in motion. This...\" he glanced around him and returned his attention to the intruder, whose face now bore a wary expression \"... is not a no-ship. Two of our no-ship monitors have you in their sights at this moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would not survive!\" the man barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg smiled amiably. \"No one on this ship would survive.\" He clenched his jaw to key the nerve signal and activate the tiny pulsetimer in his skull. It played its graphic signals against his visual centers. \"And you don\u0027t have much time in which to make a decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him how you knew to do this,\" Taraza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mother Superior and I have our own private means of communication,\" Teg said. \"But further than that, there was no need for her to warn me. Her summons was enough. The Mother Superior on a Guild Transport at a time like this? Impossible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impasse,\" the man growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Teg said. \"But neither Guild nor Ix will risk a total and all-out attack by Bene Gesserit forces under the command of a leader trained by me. I refer to the Bashar Burzmali. Your support has just dissolved and vanished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him nothing of this,\" Taraza said. \"You have just witnessed the performance of a Mentat Bashar, which I doubt could be equaled in your universe. Think of that if you consider going against Burzmali, a man trained by this Mentat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intruder looked from Taraza to Teg and back to Taraza. \"This is the way out of our seeming impasse,\" Teg said. \"The Mother Superior Taraza and her entourage leave with me. You must decide immediately. Time is running out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re bluffing.\" There was no force in the words. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-7.html","bookId":2157,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:23 PM"}
