That piece of shit you were in on Second Avenue, fucking Strindberg, how many people did I bring to see that? There was twenty-five people in the house and I brought twenty of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see your pet actor. \u0027That piece of shit you were in.\u0027 That\u0027s taking my acting seriously, Skippy baby. That\u0027s real support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t fucking believe this,\" Skip said. \"You hate me.\" He looked around the room. \"He hates me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby just looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did this to screw me. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did it for the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I woulda given you the fucking money! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to take it from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t want to take it from me. Where do you think you did take it from, you cocksucker? You think it came from God? You think it rained outta the sky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figure I earned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby shrugged. \"Like I said. I figure I earned it. I worked for it. I was with you, I don\u0027t know how many times, from the day I took the books. I was along for the ride Monday night, on the scene, everything. And you never had the least suspicion. That\u0027s not the worst job of acting anybody ever did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just an acting job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could look at it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judas was pretty good, too. He got an Oscar nomination but he couldn\u0027t be present at the awards ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make a funny-looking Jesus, Arthur. You\u0027re just not right for the part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip stared hard at him. \"I don\u0027t get it,\" he said. \"You\u0027re not even ashamed of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that make you happy? A little show of shame?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s okay, right? Putting your best friend through hell, costing him a lot of money? Stealing from him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never stole, right, Arthur?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you come up with twenty grand, Arthur? What did you do, save your lunch money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We skimmed it. That\u0027s not much of a secret. You mean I stole from the government? Show me anybody with a cash business who doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how did you get the money to open the joint? How did you and John get started? Did you skim that, too? Tips you didn\u0027t declare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit! You worked behind the stick at Jack Balkin\u0027s joint and you stole with both hands. You did everything but take the empties to the grocery store for the deposit. You stole so much offa Jack it\u0027s a wonder he didn\u0027t have to close the place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He made money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and so did you. You stole, and Johnny stole where he was working, and lo and behold, the two of you got enough to open a place of your own. Talk about the American Dream, that\u0027s the American Dream. Steal from the boss until you can afford to open up in competition with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip said something inaudible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that? I can\u0027t hear you, Arthur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said bartenders steal. It\u0027s expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes it honest, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t screw Balkin. I made money for him. You can twist it all you want, Bobby, you can\u0027t make me into what you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re a fucking saint, Arthur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Skip said. \"I don\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. You\u0027re not gonna do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby shook his head. \"What are you gonna do? You gonna get the gun from behind the bar, come back and shoot me with it? You\u0027re not gonna do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ought to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but it\u0027s not gonna happen. You want to hit me? You\u0027re not even mad anymore, Arthur. You think you oughta be mad but you don\u0027t feel it. You don\u0027t feel anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, I\u0027m beat,\" Bobby said. \"I\u0027m gonna make it an early night if nobody objects. Listen, guys, I\u0027ll pay it back one of these days. The whole fifty thousand. When I\u0027m a star, you know? I\u0027m good for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bobby-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAFTER the three of us had walked Skip around the corner and said goodnight to him, after John Kasabian had flagged a cab and headed uptown, I stood on the corner with Billie Keegan and told him I\u0027d made a mistake, that I shouldn\u0027t have told Skip what I\u0027d learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"You had to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now he knows his best friend hates his guts.\" I turned, looked up at the Parc Vendome. \"He lives on a high floor,\" I said. \"I hope he doesn\u0027t decide to go out a window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not the type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had to tell him,\" Billie Keegan said. \"What are you gonna do, let him go on thinking Bobby\u0027s his friend? That kind of ignorance isn\u0027t bliss. What you did, you lanced a boil for him. Right now it hurts like a bastard but it\u0027ll heal. You leave it, it just gets worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Count on it. If Bobby got by with this he\u0027d do something else. He\u0027d keep on until Skip knew about it, because it\u0027s not enough to screw Skip, Bobby\u0027s gotta rub his nose in it while he\u0027s at it. You see what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. Billie? I want to hear that song.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sacred ginmill, cuts the brain in sections. The one you played for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Last Call.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, come on up. We\u0027ll have a couple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t really drink much. I went with him to his apartment and he played the song five, six times for me. We talked a little, but mostly we just listened to the record. When I left he told me again that I\u0027d done the right thing in exposing Bobby Ruslander. I still wasn\u0027t sure he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slept late the next day. That night I went out to Sunnyside Gardens in Queens with Danny Boy Bell and two uptown friends of his. There was a middleweight on the card, a Bedford-Stuyvesant kid Danny Boy\u0027s friends had an interest in. He won his fight handily, but I didn\u0027t think he showed a whole lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day was Friday, and I was having a late lunch in Armstrong\u0027s when Skip came in and had a beer with me. He\u0027d just come from the gym and he was thirsty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, I was strong today,\" he said. \"All the anger goes right into the muscles. I could have lifted the roof off the place. Matt? Did I patronize him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All that shit about I made him my pet actor. Was that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he was just looking for a way to justify what he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Maybe I do what he said. Remember you got a hair up your ass when I paid your bar tab?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I did that with him. But on a bigger scale.\" He lit a cigarette, coughed hard. Recovering, he said, \"Fuck it, the man\u0027s a scumbag. That\u0027s all. I\u0027m just gonna forget about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else can you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I knew. He\u0027ll pay me back when he\u0027s rich and famous, I liked that part. Is there any way we can get the money back from those other two fucks? We know who they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can you threaten them with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Nothing, I guess. The other night you gathered everybody together for a war council, but that was just setting the stage, wasn\u0027t it? To have everybody on hand when you put it all on Bobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seemed like a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. But as far as having a war council, or whatever you want to call it, and figuring out a way to sandbag those actors and get the money back-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, neither can I. What am I gonna do, stick up the stickup men? Not really my style. And the thing is, it\u0027s only money. I mean that\u0027s really all it is. I had this money in the bank, where I wasn\u0027t really getting anything out of it, and now I haven\u0027t got it, and what difference does it make in my life? You know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wish I could let go of it,\" he said, \"because I go around and around and around with it in my mind. I just wish I could leave it alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my sons with me that weekend. It was going to be our last weekend together before they went off to camp. I picked them up at the train station Saturday morning and put them back on the train Sunday night. We saw a movie, I remember, and I think we spent Sunday morning exploring down around Wall Street and the Fulton Fish Market, but that may have been a different weekend. It\u0027s hard to distinguish them in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent Sunday evening in the Village and didn\u0027t get back to my hotel until almost dawn. The telephone woke me out of a frustrating dream, an exercise in acrophobic frustration; I kept trying to descend from a perilous catwalk and kept not reaching the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the phone. A gruff voice said, \"Well, it\u0027s not the way I figured it would go, but at least we don\u0027t have to worry about losing it in court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack Diebold. What\u0027s the matter with you? You sound like you\u0027re half asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m up now,\" I said. \"What were you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t seen a paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was sleeping. What did-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what time it is? It\u0027s almost noon. You\u0027re keeping pimp\u0027s hours, you son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go get yourself a newspaper,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll call you in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE News gave it the front page. KILL SUSPECT HANGS SELF IN CELL, with the story on page three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguelito Cruz had torn his clothing into strips, knotted the strips together, stood his iron bedstead on its side, climbed onto it, looped his homemade rope around an overhead pipe, and jumped off the upended bedstead and into the next world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Diebold never did call me back, but that evening\u0027s six o\u0027clock TV news had the rest of the story. Informed of his friend\u0027s death, Angel Herrera had recanted his original story and admitted that he and Cruz had conceived and executed the Tillary burglary on their own. It had been Miguelito who heard noises upstairs and picked up a kitchen knife on his way to investigate. He\u0027d stabbed the woman to death while Herrera watched in horror. Miguelito always had a short temper, Herrera said, but they were friends, even cousins, and they had concocted their story to protect Miguelito. But now that Miguelito was dead, Herrera could admit what had really happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE funny thing was that I felt like going out to Sunset Park. I was done with the case, everyone was done with the case, but I felt as though I ought to be working my way through the Fourth Avenue bars, buying rum drinks for ladies and eating bags of plantain chips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I didn\u0027t go there. I never really considered it. I just had the feeling that it was something I ought to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night I was in Armstrong\u0027s. I wasn\u0027t drinking particularly hard or fast, but I was working at it, and then somewhere around ten-thirty or eleven the door opened and I knew who it was before I turned around. Tommy Tillary, all dressed up and freshly barbered, was making his first appearance in Armstrong\u0027s since his wife got herself killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, look who\u0027s back,\" he sang out, and grinned that big grin. People rushed over to shake his hand. Billie was behind the stick, and he\u0027d no sooner set up one on the house for our hero than Tommy insisted on buying a round for the bar. It was an expensive gesture, there must have been thirty or forty people in there, but I don\u0027t think he cared if there were three or four hundred. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-34.html","bookId":2324,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM"}
