He also had to peel her hands away from the steering wheel. His expression was grim, and yet he was being so gentle with her as he lifted her through the window. Phillips was there, too, and he looked almost as worried as Liam. How had they gotten there so fast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam didn\u0027t let go of her. He held her tight against him. She could feel him shaking when he asked, \"Are you all right? Are you bleeding anywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" she said, surprised she could raise her voice to little more than a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever did this to you . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoping to calm him, she motioned for him to put her down. She brushed herself off and said, \"All right, then. I\u0027m going to need a ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillips actually smiled, a first for him, but Liam still looked as though he wanted to go to war. He wrapped his arm around her shoulders for support and said, \"You\u0027re going to the hospital. You could have internal bleeding . . . a brain injury . . . or a-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not going to the hospital,\" she argued. \"I didn\u0027t hit my head, and my backpack protected me from the airbag.\" It wasn\u0027t until she got a good look at her car that she started shaking. Then she spotted the remains of her laptop. \"My computer . . . ,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take care of that for you,\" Phillips assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really was a miracle she survived without a single injury. \"I\u0027m fine, Liam,\" she protested. \"And I most assuredly am not bleeding internally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you have X-ray vision, you can\u0027t know if you\u0027re bleeding or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to have to put her foot down. \"I\u0027m not going to the hospital. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her to the hospital. All of her protests were completely ignored, and that didn\u0027t surprise her. He never listened to her. She told him just that as the nurse was pushing her into a wheelchair in the emergency room. She was poked and prodded, x-rayed and scanned, and finally declared perfectly fit. The physician in charge lingered by the side of her bed after giving her the good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there something more?\" Allison asked. \"Have you thought of yet another test you\u0027d like to run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"No, you\u0027re good to go. I was just thinking . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" she asked, wondering why he was hesitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to go out with me sometime?\" He handed her a card with his cell phone number on it. \"Call me. Anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what to say. She took the card, thanked him for taking care of her, and decided to get Liam out of there as quickly as possible. He was staring at the doctor and looking quite incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m standing right here,\" he announced with a good deal of irritation as the doctor walked out of the cubicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saw you, Agent Scott,\" Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam sat on the side of the bed and draped his arm around her to pull her toward him. Had the doctor still been there, he would have kissed Allison, just to let him know she wasn\u0027t available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guessed he should let Allison know it first. \"We need to talk,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you get back from Berlin?\" she asked at the very same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, because the nurse came to discharge her at that moment. Allison insisted that he take her to the office. She knew Phillips would have a hundred questions and she wanted to get the interrogation over as quickly as possible. She waited until they were alone and sitting in Phillips\u0027s office to ask Liam what he had wanted to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, we aren\u0027t. There is no you and me. We\u0027re in a nonrelationship, and that\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned against the desk and smiled. \"If we\u0027re in a nonrelationship, how can it be over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would use logic. She shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. It just is.\" She sat down. \"I\u0027m through talking about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillips entered the office and interrupted. She braced herself for the inquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you feeling?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shocked by the sympathy she heard in his voice. She didn\u0027t want him to be kind to her. She liked him just the way he usually was. Maybe she had hit her head after all, because she wasn\u0027t making much sense. She started to answer that she was perfectly fine, but when she looked down, she noticed her hands were shaking almost violently. \"It\u0027s been quite an evening,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it has,\" Phillips agreed. \"Flying down that hill-\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-98.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
