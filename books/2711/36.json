{"id":74348,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, please don’t let her be serious. There’s no way my heart will survive this for a few days. I’ll be lucky if I make it through the end of today knowing how I’ve made her feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss my bag back toward my bedroom door since I won’t need it for a while. I lean forward in defeat and rest my elbows on the bar, crumpling the note up in my fist. I stare down at the laptop before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiece of shit computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the hell didn’t I have a password on it? Why the hell didn’t I take it with me when I left the hospital? Why the hell didn’t I delete everything? Why the hell did I even write anything to Sydney in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never hated an inanimate object as much as I hate this computer. I slam the screen shut and bring my fist down on top of it with all my strength. I wish I could hear it crack. I wish I could hear the sound my fist makes each time I bring it down forcefully. I want to hear it crushed beneath my fist the same way my heart feels crushed inside my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up straight and pick the laptop up, then slam it down on the bar. I see Warren exit his bedroom out of the corner of my eye, but I’m too pissed to care if I’m making too much noise. I continue to pick the laptop up and slam it against the bar over and over, but it doesn’t diminish the hatred I feel for it in the least, and it also doesn’t do enough damage to the casing. Warren walks toward the kitchen and heads to a cabinet. He reaches inside and grabs something, then walks over to me. I pause my attack on the computer and look up to see him holding out a hammer. I gladly take it, then step back and bring the hammer down against the laptop with all my might. This time, I can actually see the cracks appear with each hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit it over and over and watch as pieces fly in all directions. I’m also leaving a hefty amount of damage on the bar beneath my mangled computer, but I don’t give a shit. Countertops are replaceable. What this computer destroyed of Maggie isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen there isn’t much left of the computer to destroy, I finally drop the hammer on the bar. I’m out of breath. I turn and slide down to the floor with my back against the cabinets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren walks around me and sits on the floor in front of me, resting his back against the wall behind him. “Feel better?” he signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. I don’t feel better, I just feel worse. Now I know for a fact that it’s not the laptop I’m mad at. It’s me. I’m mad at myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything I can do to help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ponder his question. The only thing that could help me get Maggie back is to prove to her that there’s nothing going on between me and Sydney. In order to prove that to her, I need to not have any interaction with Sydney whatsoever. That’s kind of hard with her in the very next room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you help Sydney move?” I sign. “Today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren lowers his chin at my request, eyeing me with disappointment. “Today? Her apartment won’t be ready for three more days. Besides, she needs furniture, and what we ordered this morning isn’t even being delivered until the day she moves in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my wallet out of my pocket and remove my credit card. “Take her to a hotel, then. I’ll pay for her room until her apartment is ready. I need her out in case Maggie comes back. She can’t be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren takes my card and stares at it for several seconds before bringing his eyes back to mine. “This is kind of a shitty move considering this is your fault. Don’t expect me to be the one to ask her to leave today. You owe her that much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit, Warren’s reaction surprises me. Yesterday he seemed to hate Sydney. Today he’s acting as if he’s protecting her. “I already told her I need her to leave today. Do me a favor, and make sure she gets moved in okay this week. Get her anything she needs. Groceries, extra furniture, Whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m beginning to stand up when the door to Sydney’s room opens. She’s walking out backward, pulling both of her suitcases. Warren scrambles to his feet next to me, and as soon as she turns around and her eyes lock with mine, she freezes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guilt over what I’m having her do hits me when I see the tears in her eyes. She doesn’t deserve this. She hasn’t done anything to deserve all that I’ve put her through. The way it makes me feel to know I’ve hurt her is exactly why I need her to leave, because I shouldn’t care this much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do. God, I care about her so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI break eye contact with her and look back to Warren. “Thank you for helping her,” I sign. I head back to my room, not wanting to watch Sydney walk out the front door. I can’t imagine losing both her and Maggie in the course of a few hours, but it’s actually happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren grabs my arm as I pass him, forcing me to turn and look at him. “You aren’t even going to tell her good-bye?” he signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell her good-bye when I don’t really want her to leave.” I continue toward my room, thankful that I can’t hear the sound of the front door closing behind her when she leaves. I don’t know if I could take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my phone and lie down on my bed. I pull up Maggie’s number and send her a text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I’ll give you however much time you need. I love you more than you even realize. I’m not going to deny anything I said to Sydney, because it was all true, especially the parts about you and how much I love you. I know you’re hurt, and I know I betrayed you, but please. You have to know how much I’ve fought for you. Please don’t end us like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the send button and pull the phone to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I fucking cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me get those,” Warren says as he bends to pick up my suitcases. He carries them down the steps, and I follow him. Once we make it to his car, I realize I don’t even know where I’m going. I haven’t thought this far ahead. As soon as Ridge told me he needed me to leave today, I just packed my things and walked out without even a plan for what I’m going to do for the next three days. My new apartment isn’t ready, but I’m wishing I could be in it. I want to be as far away as I can get right now from Ridge and Maggie and Warren and Bridgette and Hunter and Tori and everything and everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ridge wants me to take you to a hotel until your apartment is ready, but is there anywhere else you’d rather go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren is now sitting in the driver’s seat, and I’m in the front passenger’s seat. I don’t even remember us getting into his car. I turn and look at him, and he’s just staring at me. The car hasn’t even been cranked yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I feel so pathetic. I feel like a burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s laughable, isn’t it?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gesture to myself. “This.” I lean my head against the headrest and close my eyes. “I should just go back home to my parents. I’m obviously not cut out for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren sighs. “Not cut out for what? College? Real life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “Independence in general, really. Hunter was right when he told me I’d be better off living with him than on my own. He was right about that, at least. I’ve been in Ridge’s life less than three months, and I’ve successfully ruined his entire relationship with Maggie.” I look out the window, up to his empty balcony. “I’ve also ruined his entire friendship with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren cranks the car, then reaches over and squeezes my hand. “Today is a really bad day, Syd. A really, really bad day. Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.” He lets go of my hand and backs out of the parking spot. “And you’ve made it this long without having to go back to your parents. You can make it three more days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t afford a hotel, Warren. I spent my savings on furniture and the deposit for the new apartment. Just take me to the bus station. I’ll go stay with my parents for a few days.” I pick up my phone in order to bite the bullet and call them, but Warren pulls it out of my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First of all, you need to stop blaming yourself for what’s happening with Ridge and Maggie. Ridge is his own person, and he knows right from wrong. He was the one in the relationship, not you. Second, you need to allow Ridge to pay for this hotel, because he’s the one making you leave without a notice. As much as I love the guy, he sort of owes you big-time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch the empty balcony as we drive away. “Why do I feel like I’ve been taking Ridge’s handouts since the day I met him?” I look away from the balcony, feeling the anger building in my chest, but I don’t even know who I’m mad at. Love, maybe? I think I’m mad at love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why you feel the way you do,” Warren says, “but you need to stop. You’ve never asked any of us for a single thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, trying to agree with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Warren is right. Ridge is just as guilty in this as I am. He’s the one in the relationship. He should have asked me to leave as soon as he knew he was developing feelings for me. He also should have given me more than five minutes to move out. He made me feel like more of a liability than someone he’s supposed to care about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right, Warren. And you know what? If Ridge is paying, I want you to take me to a really nice hotel. One with room service and a minibar full of tiny bottles of Pine-Sol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren laughs. “That’s my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been seventy-two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough time for me to come up with even more things I need to say to Maggie. Enough time for Warren to let me know that Sydney is finally in her own apartment. He wouldn’t tell me which one, but that’s probably for the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventy-two hours has also been enough time for me to realize that I miss having Sydney in my life almost as much as I miss Maggie. And it’s enough time to know that I’m not going another day without talking to Maggie. I need to know that she’s okay. I’ve done nothing but pace this apartment since the moment I lost her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the moment I lost both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my phone and palm it for several minutes, too scared to text her. I’m afraid of what her response will be. When I finally do type out a text, I close my eyes and hit send.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Are you ready to talk about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at my phone, waiting for her to respond. I want to know if she’s okay. I want to be able to tell her my side. The fact that she’s more than likely thinking the worst is killing me, and it feels as if I haven’t been able to breathe since she found out about Sydney and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie: I’ll never be ready, but it needs to be done. I’m home all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs ready as I am to see her, I’m also scared to death. I don’t want to see her heartbroken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I’ll be there in an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my things and head straight out the door—straight back to the half of my heart that needs the most mending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a key to her place. I’ve had a key to her place for three years, but I haven’t had to ring her doorbell in all that time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/maybe-someday/page-36.html","bookId":2711,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
