What does that sound like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen him at a meeting in a week and a half. Now we don\u0027t always go to the same meetings but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you expect to run into him now and then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I give him five grand in case something comes up, and the minute something comes up he says he doesn\u0027t have it. What did he spend it on? Or if he\u0027s lying, what\u0027s he saving it for? Two questions and one answer, way it looks to me. Jay-You-En-Kay. What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There could be another explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m willing to hear it.\" He picked up a phone, dialed a number, and stood there holding himself in check while the phone rang. It must have rung ten times before he gave up. \"No answer, but it means nothing. When he used to hole up with a bottle he would go days without answering his phone. I asked him once why he didn\u0027t at least take it off the hook. Then I\u0027d know he was there, he said. He\u0027s a devious bastard, my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the disease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The habit, you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We generally call it a disease. I guess it amounts to the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He kicked junk, you know. He was hooked bad and he quit it, but then he got into the booze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long was he sober? Over a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year and a half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think if you could do it that long you could do it forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A day is the most anybody can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said impatiently. \"A day at a time. I know all that, I heard all the slogans. When he was first getting sober Petey was here all the time. Francey and I would sit with him and give him coffee and listen to him run off at the mouth. Everything he heard at a meeting he came back and filled our ears with it, but we didn\u0027t mind because he was starting to put his life back together again. Then one day he told me how he couldn\u0027t hang out with me so much anymore because it could undercut his sobriety. Now he\u0027s somewhere with a bag of dope and a bottle of whiskey and what the hell happened to his sobriety?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that, Kenan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on me. \"What else, for Christ\u0027s sake? What\u0027s he doing with five grand, buying lottery tickets? I never should have given him that much money. It\u0027s too much temptation. Whatever happens to him, it\u0027s my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"If you gave him a cigar box full of heroin and said \u0027Watch this for me until I get back,\u0027 then it\u0027d be your fault. That\u0027s more temptation than anybody should have to handle. But he\u0027s been clean and dry for a year and a half and he knows how to be responsible for his own sobriety. If the money made him nervous he could put it in the bank, or ask somebody in the program to hold it for him. Maybe he went out and maybe he didn\u0027t, we don\u0027t know yet, but whatever he did you didn\u0027t make him do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s never hard. I don\u0027t know what a bag of dope costs these days, but you can still get a drink for a couple of dollars, and one\u0027s all it takes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One wouldn\u0027t hold you for very long, though. Still, five thousand dollars ought to keep him going for a hell of a run. What can you spend on liquor, twenty dollars a day if you drink it at home? Two, three times that if you buy it over the bar? Heroin\u0027s a more expensive proposition, but even so it\u0027s hard to put more than a couple hundred dollars a day in your arm, and it\u0027d take him a while to build his habit back up. Even if he makes a pig of himself, it ought to take him a month to shoot up five grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t use a needle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told you that, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"He told people that, and there was a period when all he did was snort, but he was a needle junkie for a while there. The lie made the habit sound less serious. Plus he was afraid if women knew he used to shoot dope they\u0027d be afraid to go to bed with him. Not that he\u0027s been knocking them over like dominoes lately, but you don\u0027t want to make it harder on yourself. He figured they\u0027d assume he shared needles and be afraid he was HIV-positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he didn\u0027t share needles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Says he didn\u0027t. And he got tested, and he doesn\u0027t have the virus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was just thinking. Maybe he did share needles, maybe he never went for the HIV test. He could lie about that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you use a needle? Or do you just snort?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a junkie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter told me you snort a bag of dope about once a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was this? On the phone Saturday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A week before. We went to a meeting, then had a meal and hung out together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he told you that, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he was here at your house a few days before that and you were high. He said he called you on it and you denied it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his eyes for a moment, lowered his voice, too, when he spoke. \"Yeah, it\u0027s true,\" he said. \"He did call me on it, and I did deny it. I thought he bought it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I guess not. It bothered me to lie about it. It didn\u0027t bother me that I did up the dope. I wouldn\u0027t do it in front of him and I wouldn\u0027t have done it just then if I\u0027d known he was coming over, but it don\u0027t hurt anybody, least of all me, if I do up a bag of dope once in a blue moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said once a month? To tell you the truth, I doubt if it\u0027s that much. My guess would be seven, eight, ten times a year. It\u0027s never been more than that. I shouldn\u0027t have lied to him. I should have said, \u0027Yeah, I been feeling like shit, so I got off, and so what?\u0027 Because I can do it a few times a year and it never comes to more than that, and if he has one little taste he\u0027s got the whole habit back and they\u0027re stealing his shoes when he nods out in the subway. That happened to him, he woke up on the D train in his socks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s happened to a lot of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Including you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it could have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an alcoholic, right? I had a drink before you came over here. If you asked me I\u0027d say so, I wouldn\u0027t lie about it. Why did I lie about it to my brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s part of it. Oh, shit, man. I\u0027m worried about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing you can do at this point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, what am I gonna do, drive through the streets looking for him? We\u0027ll go together. You look out one side of the car for the fuckers who killed my wife and I\u0027ll look out the other side for my brother. How\u0027s that for a plan?\" He made a face. \"In the meantime I owe you money. What did we say, twenty-seven hundred?\" He had a roll of hundreds in his pocket and counted out twenty-seven of them, which pretty much depleted the roll. He handed the money to me and I found a place to put it. He said, \"What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay with it,\" I said. \"Some of what I try will depend on where the police investigation leads, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he cut in, \"that\u0027s not what I mean. What do you do now? You got a date for dinner, you got something doing in the city, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I had to think. \"I\u0027ll probably go back to my room. I\u0027ve been on my feet all day, I want to take a shower and change my clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You plan to walk back? Or will you take the subway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I won\u0027t walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose I drive you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I have to do something,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN the car he asked me the location of the famous laundromat and said he wanted to have a look at it. We drove there and he parked the Buick across the street from it and killed the engine. \"So we\u0027re on a stakeout,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what it\u0027s called, right? Or is that only on TV?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A stakeout generally goes on for hours,\" I said. \"So I hope we\u0027re not on one at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just wanted to sit here for a minute. I wonder how many times I drove past this place. It never once occurred to me to stop and make a phone call. Matt, you\u0027re sure these guys are the same ones who killed the two women and cut the girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because this was for profit and the others were strictly, uh, what\u0027s the word? Pleasure? Recreation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But the similarities are too specific and too striking. It has to be the same men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because a drug dealer makes an ideal target, lots of cash and a reason to steer clear of the police. We discussed that before. And one of the men had a thing about drugs. He kept asking Pam if she knew any dealers, if she took drugs. He was evidently obsessed with the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why a drug dealer. That\u0027s not why me.\" He leaned forward, propped his arms on the steering wheel. \"Who even knows I\u0027m a dealer? I haven\u0027t been arrested, haven\u0027t had my name in the papers. My phone\u0027s not tapped and my house isn\u0027t bugged. I\u0027m positive my neighbors don\u0027t have a clue how I make my money. The DEA investigated me a year and a half ago and they dropped the whole thing because they weren\u0027t getting anyplace. The NYPD I don\u0027t even think they know I\u0027m alive. You\u0027re some degenerate, likes to kill women, wants to get rich knocking off a drug dealer, how do you even know of my existence? That\u0027s what I want to know. Why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I started off thinking I\u0027m the target. You know, that the whole thing begins with someone looking to hurt me and take me off. But that\u0027s not true, according to you. It starts with crazies who are getting off on rape and murder. Then they decide to make it pay, and then they decide to go after a drug dealer, and then I\u0027m elected. So I can\u0027t get anywhere backtracking people I know professionally, somebody who maybe thinks I screwed him in a transaction and he sees a good way of getting even. I\u0027m not saying there aren\u0027t any crazy people dealing in the product, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I follow you. And you\u0027re right. You\u0027re the target incidentally. They\u0027re looking for a dope dealer and you\u0027re one they know of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how?\" He hesitated. \"There was a thought I had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t think it makes much sense. But I gather my brother tells his story at meetings, right? He sits up in front and tells everybody what he did and where it got him. And I assume he mentions how his brother makes his living. Am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I knew Pete had a brother who dealt drugs, but I didn\u0027t know your name or where you lived. I didn\u0027t even know Pete\u0027s last name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you asked him he would have told you. And how hard would it be to get the rest? \u0027I think I know your brother. He live in Bushwick?\u0027 \u0027No, Bay Ridge.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yeah? What street?\u0027 I don\u0027t know. I guess it\u0027s farfetched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems it to me,\" I said. \"I grant you you\u0027ll find all kinds at an AA meeting, and there\u0027s nothing to stop a serial killer from walking in the doors. God knows a lot of the famous ones were alcoholic, and always under the influence when they did their killing. But I don\u0027t know of any of them that ever got sober in the program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so. Most things are. Still, if our friends live here in Sunset Park and Peter went to Manhattan meetings-\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-31.html","bookId":2328,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
