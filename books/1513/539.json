Even the A.I. Chip had not been able to analyse it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, the combination of the real bloodline of the Sun’s Child and its DNA sequence worked together to solve the many difficulties that had been confounding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Dragon King’s Mystic Might he had obtained in the past, he now also had the Void Phantom, which came to two complete meditation techniques. This meant he had a decent, accurate database to draw upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe simulation of the fifth level of Kemoyin’s pupil saw some progress once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that his main objective was satisfied, Leylin couldn’t help but sigh with relief. “Rank 6, top-grade creature— Sun’s Child!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin observed the blood that was like a little sun, and began to furrow his eyebrows. With this and the Wing of the Sun, he could instantly create a powerful Warlock family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarlocks with a bloodline stemming from a rank 6 creature hadn’t yet appeared in the central continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If another Warlock or Magus were to find out, things would get complicated for me…” A wry smile appeared about Leylin’s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could it be only ‘complicated’? The moment this news leaked, even if malicious Warlocks weren’t an issue, it was highly likely that the Breaking Dawn Monarchs would be alerted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, they would not want to see the rise of another Breaking Dawn bloodline Warlock, which would affect the current equilibrium of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a pity… If not for my bloodline being permanent, I would long since have used the Sun’s Child’s bloodline…” Leylin heaved a long sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his eyes immediately cleared up, “Classify this area as a forbidden region of the highest grade, confidentiality rank X. Anyone who comes in here besides me is to be killed. No exceptions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was cold, as if every word of his carried with it chilly air that contained millions of ice shards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood!” The spirit genie’s similarly unfeeling voice sounded. Perhaps only beings that lacked human intelligence would not understand the terror that was Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On top of that,” Leylin looked at his empty surroundings, gently stroking a crystal ring on his finger. *Whoosh!* Five translucent phantoms appeared around him like a breeze, as if voluntarily squeezing out from the void. There were no energy waves, just five pairs of bloodshot eyes staring at him as their owners half-kneeled on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Protect this place well. Any who dare intrude are to be eliminated immediately,” Leylin said as he sent out a spiritual command through the ring on his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five phantoms nodded speechlessly, and immediately disappeared into the air. With them concealed, even the A.I. Chip could barely discern their auras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These Void Assassins are pretty useful. It’s a pity that there are only eight left…” Leylin was full of admiration as he watched the assassins disappear, touching his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese eight Void Assassins were naturally his gains from Scarlet Crescent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had carefully checked before. Every one of these Void Assassins had the strength surpassing a Crystal Phase Magus. Their method of travelling through the void was stealthy and hard to defend against. Even a Morning Star Magus would be in danger if five of them acted in tandem, ambushing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these defences, he could somewhat relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can’t keep it here, and I need to use it as soon as possible. Alternatively, I can wait till the Magus Tower is completed and deposit it there!’ Leylin pondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the bloodline of the Sun’s Child to perform experiments on bloodline ignition was too much of a pity. Leylin still had other uses for this blood. The bloodline of an ancient rank 6 creature was an invaluable treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next is to amass more strength and push for the advancement of my soul force. The best would be for the A.I. Chip to represent soul force numerically, which will make everything much simpler…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin subconsciously looked at his status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Leylin Farlier, Rank 4 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent. Strength: 50, Agility: 45, Vitality: 65, Spiritual Force:506.9, Magic Power: 506 (Magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force). Soul Force: ???]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter entering Morning Star, the aim was to make progress in regards to the soul. His spiritual force and other stats would no longer undergo major changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this thought, Leylin looked into the progress of the A.I. Chip’s simulation of soul force and found it to be stuck. He couldn’t help but roll his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The analysis of soul force cannot be done in a day or two…” A thread of understanding rose in Leylin’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive years passed in the blink of an eye. The original Ouroboros Clan had now completely stabilised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the other allied forces still occupied a part of the territory that had belonged to them, a larger war had not occurred. From how a few organisations were silently withdrawing their forces, the general situation was progressing positively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose Warlocks seemed to have forgotten their hatred from the past and the situation at Phosphorescence Swamp stabilised as they continued with their lives and research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, the subconscious bloody glint that remained in the depths of their eyes proved that the traces of the war were still present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr rather, the seeds of revenge were buried deep in their hearts. They were lying quietly in wait for these seeds to grow, until the day they began to thrive and became strong and healthy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin couldn’t wait to see it happen, and even added fuel to the flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his perspective, the bloodline Warlocks before led far too comfortable lives, particularly the Kemoyin nobility. They spent their days in their territories intoxicated, not spending any time on their Warlock training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, after this war, most of these vermin had disappeared, leaving behind many capable and hardworking descendants, each of them outstanding. These talents were the strengths and assets that he regarded as important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as he could lead these Warlocks and complete their revenge, he might instantly gain their undying loyalty. That would allow him to completely control the Ouroboros Clan, and even the return of the three Dukes would not change anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough these five years, Leylin had extended his authority to all aspects in Ouroboros Clan. He had even secretly influenced many Warlocks of the new generation, and they completely accepted his rule, thinking it was normal for things to continue like this forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaisal and those few bloodline families had become smarter after the attack, and Leylin could find no opportunity to deal with them. That was rather regretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, no matter how long he tried to delay matters, there were things that needed to be done...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blood Extraction!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove a geographical basin holding an ethnic group, Leylin wore a luxurious platinum Magus robe that was actually a piece of magic equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was stern as he reached out his hand, and a formless giant vortex appeared in the air with a grab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge amounts of blood beaded down, turning into a stream as it gathered in his hands. It formed a highly concentrated crystal that looked similar to a ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow him, a giant tribe of a different race had suffered heavy casualties. Besides a few high-ranked Magi, almost nobody had survived. All of them had their blood drawn and turned into dried-out corpses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This bloodline drawing method is truly tyrannical!” Leylin nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arcane Art he was using to extract blood came from his own bloodline inheritance. In ancient times, it had only been a convenient spell to draw blood on a large-scale. However, with his modifications, as well as the power from the soul force of a Morning Star, the effect was truly terrifying. Its strength was enough to destroy a country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not all. The bloodline gems gathered from the bloodline extraction were also a very important resource for Warlocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrimson light flashed in Leylin’s eyes as he tucked away these concentrated crystals that sparkled like blood diamonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You of a different race! You dare—” A roar full of denial and pain sounded out, bringing with it energy waves at the Morning Star realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My job is done. The rest is your business.” Leylin bowed with a smile, and retreated to the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin, you really know how to goof off!” In front of him were a few Morning Star Warlocks. The burly man who was the head teased Leylin, but still went forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who exactly are you? Why did you come here?” The rays of light dimmed, revealing the Morning Star that had hastened over. It was a giant formed of flames, eyes full of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no reason. If you want to blame something, blame yourselves for occupying this area!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burly man sneered, the phantom of a large black goat that was thousands of metres tall emerging from his back. This goat not only had the horns of a demon, but also a torso that was similar to a human. However, it was full of black fleece, looking to be like the demonic satyrs of the underworld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning Star Warlock?” The giant fire elemental elder couldn’t help but blurt out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing that, others in black clothing stood up before him. The Morning Star auras they similarly emitted caused the fire elemental elder’s pupils to shrink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Rumble!* The few Morning Star Warlocks surrounded him, in an enormous formation. The energy undulations extended to the horizons, and even dispersed a few large dark clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce everything was over, the burly man from before approached Leylin, “Lord Leylin’s blood extraction truly is worthy of its reputation. Here is your reward!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burly man tossed a little pouch full of astral stones to Leylin, “The total comes to 13423 grams of astral stones. Check the amount!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many thanks!” Leylin sighed heavily. This time-consuming and very lengthy mission was finally over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides concentrating on his own research, he would take on a few missions from time to time from the Morning Star region, earning astral stones to purchase other items to nourish the soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task this time was a mission to help the burly man suppress the fire elemental elder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph! These tribes actually worship an elemental being from another world! Even death cannot wipe out their sins!” The burly man scolded, still angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-538\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-540\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-539","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
