Screams tore the night air. His jaws crunched down through the bones of a human neck. A lash of one clawed paw ripped one side from a dog, flinging the dying beast into the brush. And then through, away from that world and into a sodden jungle lit by flashes of lightning – the reek of sulphur heavy in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown a bank of mud, into a charnel pit of rotting corpses, the bloated bodies of men and horses, someone singing plaintively in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burning forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor of a palace or temple – dozens of robed people fleeing with shrieks – and once more he tore through them. Human blood filling his mouth, the taste appallingly sweet. Dragging bodies down from behind, crunching through skulls – weak fists thumping into his flanks—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere deep inside him, he loosed a sob, tearing himself free – and once more the world shifted, a barren tundra now, someone kneeling beside a boulder, head lifting, eyes meeting his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Stop this. Now. Child of Treach, you lose yourself to the beast’s blood .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman, her long black hair thick and glossy as a panther’s hide, her face broad, the cheekbones high and flaring, her amber eyes filled with knowing. A few rags of caribou skin for clothes, despite the frigid air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ When you find me ,’ she continued, ‘ it will not be as you imagine. We shall not meet as lovers. We shall not desire the same things. It may be we shall fight, you and me .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched, sides heaving, muscles trembling, but the blind rage was fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made an odd gesture with one hand. ‘ A cat leaps, takes the life of a bird. Another takes the life of a child playing in the garden. This is what a cat does, do you deny this? Is there a crime in these scenes? Perhaps. For the bird, the crime of carelessness, incaution. The child? An inattentive parent? An ill-chosen place to dwell in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ The chicks in their nest cry out for a mother who will not return. Her death is their deaths. The mother grieves her loss, but perhaps there will be another child, a new life to replace the one lost. Tell me, Gruntle, how does one measure these things? How does one decide which life is the more precious? Are feelings apportioned according to intelligence and self-awareness? Does a tiny creature grieve less deeply than one of greater … stature?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ But is it not natural to rage for vengeance, for retribution? Does the dead bird’s mate dream of murder?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Child of Treach, you have taken more than just children, on this hard path of yours. In your wake, much grief now swirls. Your arrival was inexplicable to their senses, but the proof of your presence lay in pools of blood .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Be the weapon of random chance if you must. Be the unimaginable force that strikes down with no reason, no purpose. Be the taker of lives .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I will await you, at the end of this path. Will we discuss vengeance? With fang and claw? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the threat a low growl rumbled from his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was sad. She gestured again—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking, Gruntle found himself on his hands and knees, stony ground under him. He coughed and then spat to clear gobs of thick blood from his mouth, reached up and wiped his wet lips – on the back of his hand a red smear and strands of human hair. ‘Gods below,’ he muttered. ‘That was a mistake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrens were falling apart. Where was I going? What was I running from? But he remembered. Betrayals. Weaknesses. The flaws of being human – he’d sought an escape. A headlong plunge into mindlessness, fleeing from all manner of remorse and recrimination. Running away .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But what is the point?’ he said under his breath. To forget is to forget myself. Who I am, and that I must not surrender. If I do, I will have nothing left .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, but still … to be blameless. A cat above the tiny carcass of a bird. Above the corpse of a child .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlameless .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the bastards hunting me down don’t care about that. A child has died. Mothers bow in wretched grief. Weapons are taken in hand. The world is a dangerous place; they mean to make it less so. They yearn to die ancient and withered in straw beds, at the end of a long life, with skins upon their walls proclaiming their bravery .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell then, come to me if you must. To your eyes I am a monstrous tiger. But in my mind, I have a man’s cunning. And yes, I know all about vengeance .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see now where his path was taking him. Trake’s deadly gift was turning in his hands, finding a new, terrible shape. ‘You would set yourselves apart, then? Not animal. Something other. Very well, then there will be war.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-86.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
