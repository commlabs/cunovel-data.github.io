She hadn\u0027t objected when he insisted she needed to go home, get some rest, have a meal. And that worried him. \"They\u0027re pretty strict in ICU anyway, and don\u0027t let you hang out very long, so we\u0027ll take shifts. Between you and me, Shanna and some of the guys, we\u0027ll cover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t know how long he\u0027ll be in a coma. It could be hours, or days, and that\u0027s if-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When. We\u0027re going with when.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never had a very optimistic nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\" He tried to find a tone between firm and sympathetic. \"I\u0027ve got one and you can borrow a piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked like he\u0027d been beaten. Just beaten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the skull fracture. I talked to one of the nurses when you were in with him. It\u0027s part of it.\" Knowing it, even knowing it, he thought, hadn\u0027t dulled the shock when he\u0027d been allowed a minute with Steve. \"So\u0027s the coma. The coma\u0027s not a bad thing, Cilla. It\u0027s giving his body a chance to heal. It\u0027s focusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do have plenty of optimistic pieces. But this isn\u0027t a comic book where the good guy pulls it out every time. Even if-or we can go with your rainbow when-he comes out of it, there could be brain damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d gotten that, too, but saw no point in pushing through to worst-case scenario. \"In my rainbow world, and in your darker version, the brain relearns. It\u0027s a clever bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get the goddamn padlock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If somebody got in the barn and went at Steve, why do you think a padlock would\u0027ve kept them out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe curled her fingers into her palms as they approached her drive. \"I took down the gates. And planted fucking trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I figure the trees are what did it. Makes it all your fault.\" He waited for her to take a shot at him-better, to his mind, than wallowing. But she said nothing. \"Okay, again, if someone wanted in, how would a couple of wrought-iron panels stop them? What happened to pessimism?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only shook her head and stared at the house. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing here. That crazy old man was probably right. The place is cursed. My uncle died, my grandmother, and now Steve may die. For what? So I can buff and polish, paint and trim this place? Looking for that link, that click, that connection with my grandmother because I\u0027ve got none with my own mother? What\u0027s the point? She\u0027s dead, so what\u0027s the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Identity.\" Ford gripped her arm before she could push the car door open. \"How can we know who we really are until we know where we came from, and overcome it, build on it or accept it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who I am.\" She wrenched free, shoved the door open. Slammed it behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you really don\u0027t,\" Ford responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strode around the side of the house. Work, she thought, a couple hours of sweaty work, then she\u0027d clean up and go back to the hospital. The patio had been repaired, the new slate laid, with the walkways roped and dug except for the one she\u0027d added to the plans. The one leading to the barn. Yellow crime-scene tape crossed over her barn door like ugly ribbon over a nasty gift. She stared at it as Shanna dropped her shovel and raced over the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla willed her compassion back into place. She wasn\u0027t the only one worried and distressed. \"There\u0027s no change.\" She gripped Shanna\u0027s extended hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the landscape crew stopped working, and some of the men from inside the house stepped out. \"No change,\" she repeated, lifting her voice. \"They\u0027ve got him in ICU, monitoring him, and they\u0027ll be doing tests. All we can do is wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going back?\" Shanna asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, in a little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian gave Shanna a quick nod. \"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanking her phone out of her pocket, Shanna strode toward the front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her sister can pick her up,\" Brian explained. He pulled his cap off his short brown hair, raked grimy fingers through it. \"She wanted to knock off when you got here, go by and see Steve herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. That\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rest of us, and Matt and Dobby and such, we\u0027ll go by, too. Don\u0027t know as they\u0027ll let us in to see him, but we\u0027ll go by. Shanna had a jag earlier. She\u0027s blaming herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she\u0027d let him stay the night, and so on.\" Sighing, he replaced his cap. After one glance at Ford, he got the picture. Taking off his sunglasses, he focused his summer blue eyes on Cilla. \"I told her there\u0027s no ifs, and no blame except for whoever did that to Steve. Start hauling out the ifs and the blame, you could just as soon say if Steve hadn\u0027t gone out to play pool, if he hadn\u0027t gone in the barn. And that\u0027s crap. Best thing is to hold good thoughts. Anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a bandanna out of his pocket to wipe the sweat from his face. \"The cops were here, as I guess you can see. Asking questions. I can\u0027t say what they\u0027re thinking about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope they\u0027ve stopped thinking he was drunk and did that to himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shanna set them straight on the drunk part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" It loosened one of the multitude of knots in her belly. \"I met your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the hospital. She was a lot of help. Well.\" Tears continued to burn the back of her eyes as she stared into the sunlight. \"The patio looks good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helps to have work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. So give me some, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I can do.\" He shot a smile at Ford. \"How about you? Want a shovel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to watch,\" Ford said easily. \"And I\u0027ve got to check on Spock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as well. Give this guy a shovel or a pick?\" he said to Cilla. \"And if there\u0027s a pipe or a cable in the ground, he\u0027ll hit it, first cut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That only happened once. Maybe twice,\" Ford qualified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN THE CREW KNOCKED OFF, she knocked off with them and hit the shower. She wanted to say she felt human again, but was still well shy of the mark. Like an automaton, she pulled on fresh clothes. She decided she\u0027d buy some magazines, something to occupy her mind at the hospital, and maybe snag a sandwich from a vending machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she jogged downstairs, Ford stood in her unfinished living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say you\u0027re making progress, but I don\u0027t know that much about it, and it doesn\u0027t look like it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re making progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ve got dinner out on the veranda. Spock sends his regards as he\u0027s dining at home this evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner? Listen, I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to eat. So do I.\" He grabbed her hand, pulled her out. \"We\u0027ve got my secondary specialty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the paper plates and cups, the bottle of wine and the can of Coke. And in the center of the folding table sat a dish of macaroni and cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made mac and cheese?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I did. That is, I put the package in the microwave and programmed according to directions. It\u0027s mac and cheese if you aren\u0027t too fussy.\" He poured some wine in a paper cup. \"And the wine\u0027ll help it along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not having wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s \u0027cause I like the nuked version just fine, and I\u0027m driving you to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot meal, companionship. Help. All offered, she thought, without a need for asking. \"You don\u0027t have to do that, do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her chair out, nudged her into it. \"It\u0027s more satisfying to do something you don\u0027t have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you?\" She looked up, into his eyes. \"Why are you doing this for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what, Cilla, I\u0027m not entirely sure. But...\" He pressed his lips to her forehead before he sat. \"I believe you matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clutched her hands in her lap as he scooped out two heaping spoons of the macaroni and cheese onto her plate. Then, to clear her throat, she took a sip of wine. \"That\u0027s the second thing you\u0027ve said to me today no one else ever has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose eyes of his lifted, zeroed in on hers. \"No one ever told you you mattered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Steve. In different words, in different ways. But no, not just that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do. Go on and eat. That stuff gets cold, it turns to cement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The second thing-or the first, actually, that you said to me today was you wouldn\u0027t leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only looked at her, and she couldn\u0027t tell if it was pity or understanding, or simply patience, on his face. Whatever it was, she knew it was exactly what she needed. And so much what she\u0027d never expected to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you meant it, because here you are.\" She stabbed up a forkful, slid it into her mouth and smiled around it. \"It\u0027s terrible. Thanks,\" she said and stabbed another bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE WAS NO CHANGE when they arrived at the hospital, and no change when they left hours later. Cilla slept with the phone clutched in her hand, willing it to ring, willing the on-duty nurse to call to tell her Steve was awake and lucid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no call came. The dreams did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHENANDOAH VALLEY 1960\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is how it looked, the first time I saw it. My little farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn red capri pants, a white shirt tied at the midriff and white Keds, Janet strolled arm in arm with Cilla. Janet\u0027s sunshine hair bounced in a jaunty ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, that\u0027s not true-exactly-as when I first came here there were the trailers, the lights, the cables, the trucks. The city we make on locations. You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re looking through that now. As I did then. What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pretty house, with simple lines. A family home with wide, welcoming porches with old rocking chairs where you can sit and do absolutely nothing. Sweet little gardens and big shade trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The big red barn, and oh! Horses in the paddock!\" Cilla rushed over to the paddock fence, thrilled with the breeze that fluttered through her hair and rippled the manes on the mare and her foal. \"They\u0027re so beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you always want a pony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Laughing, Cilla turned her head to smile at Janet. \"Every little girl wants a pony. And a puppy, a kitten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you never got them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I had call sheets and script changes. You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A chicken house! Just listen to them cluck.\" The sound made her laugh again. \"And pigs rooting in their pen. Look at the fields. Is that corn? And there\u0027s a kitchen garden. I can see the tomatoes from here. I could grow tomatoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet\u0027s smile was both indulgent and amused. \"And have a pony, a puppy and a kitten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what I want? I\u0027m not ten anymore. Is that what I want? I can\u0027t seem to figure it out. Is it what you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted everything I didn\u0027t have, and if I got it, it was never exactly what I wanted after all. Or in the long run. Even this place.\" She swept out an arm, a graceful dancer\u0027s gesture, to encompass the farm. \"I fell in love, but then I fell easy and often, as everyone knows, and out again. And I thought, I have to have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting both her arms, Janet turned, circle after circle. \"The family home with the wide, welcoming porches, the big red barn, tomatoes on the vine. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve never had. But I can buy it, I can own it.\" She stopped spinning. \"Then, of course, I had to change it. The gardens had to be lusher, the colors bolder, the lights brighter. I needed bright, bright lights. And even though I made it bolder, brighter, even though I brought the stars here to stroll like Gatsby\u0027s ghosts across the lawn, it never really changed. It never lost its welcome. And I never fell out of love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came here to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I?\" Janet cocked her head, looked up under her lashes, suddenly sly. \"You wonder, don\u0027t you? It\u0027s one of the reasons you\u0027re here. Secrets-we all have them. Yours are here, too. It\u0027s why you came. You told yourself you\u0027d put it back, as it was, and somehow put me back. But like me, you\u0027ll make changes. You already have. It\u0027s not me you\u0027re looking for. It\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dream she felt a quick shiver, a chill from truth. \"There is no me without you. I see you when I look in the mirror. I hear you when I speak. There\u0027s a filter over it all, just enough to dim the brilliance, but you\u0027re under there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you want the pony or the call sheets, Cilla?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while, I wanted both. But I\u0027d have been happier with the pony.\" Cilla nodded, looked back toward the house. \"Yes, and the family home. You\u0027re right. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. But it\u0027s not enough. The secrets, the shadows of them. They\u0027re still here. People get hurt in the dark. Steve got hurt in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then turn on the lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just a dream.\" Janet smiled, shrugged. \"I don\u0027t have any answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN SHE WOKE, Cilla grabbed the phone she\u0027d dropped in her sleep and speed-dialed the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay in the dim light of predawn, the phone pressed between her breasts, wondering if she should feel fear or relief. He hadn\u0027t died in the night, hadn\u0027t slipped away from her while she slept. But he still lay trapped in that between world, that place between life and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she\u0027d go talk to him, nag him, browbeat him into waking up. She climbed out of bed, cleaned herself up. She\u0027d make coffee, she thought, make lists for any of the subs she might miss while she was at the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she passed the next bedroom she stopped, and studied Ford. He slept half in, half out of the sleeping bag. And what was out, she had to admit, was very nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog curled at the foot of the bag, snoring like a chain saw in mid-massacre. Ford hadn\u0027t wanted Spock to spend the night alone, she remembered, and went to get him when they returned from the hospital. Went to get his dog, she thought, after he told her he\u0027d be sleeping in the spare room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t leave her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went down, made the coffee, drinking hers on the back veranda. There had been no patio in the dream, but her subconscious had known Janet had added that, and the walkways. The crops in the field, another given. The kitchen garden? She couldn\u0027t remember if that had been original, or one of Janet\u0027s additions. Either way, it was something she herself wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the barn? It was no longer red. That bright color had weathered away long ago. The coffee turned bitter in her throat as she stared at the yellow tape crossing the door. If Steve died, she\u0027d tear the bastard down. Tear it down, burn it, and everything inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSqueezing her eyes shut, she battled back the anger that wanted to scream out of her. If he lived, she told herself, if he came back whole, she\u0027d paint it that bright, happy red again. Red with white trim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy God gave a damn if she burned the barn to the ground or painted it red with yellow smiley faces she couldn\u0027t say. But it was the best she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back inside, poured another mug and carried it upstairs to Ford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat cross-legged beside him and, sipping her own second cup of coffee, gave him a good study. Unlike his dog, he didn\u0027t snore, which added points in his favor, but the way he sprawled indicated bed hog. Points deducted. He had a good growth of stubble going, considering he hadn\u0027t shaved the day before, but she had to admit it added a sexy edge to the package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t what she\u0027d call buff or ripped, but reasonably toned over a build that leaned toward skinny. Just a touch of gawkiness, she mused. Add a few cute points for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had good arms. Strong, lean rather than bulky. Best, she thought, they knew how to hold on. Major points, she decided. He just kept racking them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the lips-top score. Leaning over, she rubbed hers to his. He made a humming sound in his throat, reached out. When she eased back, his eyes blinked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have a bad dream?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. A strange one, but I\u0027m prone to them. It\u0027s morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-uh.\" He shifted enough to turn his wrist, blink at his watch. At the foot of the bag, Spock yawned, a high-pitched whine, then went back to snoring. \"Nope. Six-forty isn\u0027t morning. Crawl in here with me. I\u0027ll prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tempting.\" More so when he tugged her head down again and improved, considerably, on her casual wake-up kiss. \"Very tempting,\" she said. \"But some of the crew should be pulling up in about twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get it done in twenty minutes.\" He winced. \"That probably didn\u0027t translate to my advantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have coffee.\" She held out the mug, waved it slowly under his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You brought me coffee?\" He sat up, took the first sip. \"Now you have to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and bear me eight young, dance naked for my pleasure every Tuesday and wake me with coffee-that\u0027s after the sex-every morning. It\u0027s the law of Kroblat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Kroblat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not who. The planet Kroblat. It\u0027s a very spiritual place,\" he decided on the spot. \"I try to live my life by its laws. So, we\u0027ll have to get married and all the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get on that, first chance.\" She brushed her hand over his hair. \"Thanks for staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I got coffee, a wife and eight kids out of it. You checked on Steve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No change. I\u0027m going to go see him. Maybe I can bitch-talk him awake, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Give me ten minutes, I\u0027ll drive you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No, I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m going to sit with him awhile, nag him awhile. Then I\u0027m going to pick up some supplies and materials, drop them back here. I\u0027ll be back and forth a lot today. Let me ask you something. If I made a bargain with myself-or with God, fate. Whatever. And it was that I\u0027d paint the barn red, red with white trim if Steve comes out of this okay, would I be jinxing it if I bought the paint before... before he comes out of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. In fact, it shows faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I knew you\u0027d say that. I\u0027m just the opposite. Too scared to buy the damn paint.\" She pushed to her feet. \"I\u0027ll see you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be by the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped at the door, hesitated, then turned back to look at him. \"I can pick up dinner for tonight, if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really want to sleep with you.\" She smiled when he nearly bobbled the coffee and when Spock\u0027s tiny ears perked. What a pair they were. \"I really want to know what it\u0027s like, to just let go. But I guess it\u0027s like buying the paint, for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his gaze on hers, and smiled. Slowly. \"I\u0027ve got time. For later.\" Ford sat where he was, drinking coffee and making a mental note to write down that stuff about Kroblat. It could come in useful sometime, somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt pretty damn good for a man who\u0027d slept on the floor, he decided. And one who\u0027d had some trouble not thinking about the woman sleeping on the floor in the next room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, since he was up at this ungodly hour, he\u0027d drag his ass across the road, get in a workout, check on Steve, get a couple solid hours in on the novel, then drop by the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get your lazy ass up, too,\" he said to Spock, and juggled the dog fully awake with his foot. He heard the first truck pull up as he pulled on his pants. By the time he was dressed and pouring a second cup of coffee, with Spock doing what Spock had to do in the backyard, the noise and activity level hit the red zone. Deciding he\u0027d just borrow the mug and bring it back later, Ford headed outside with the coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Brian directing one of his men toward the back of the house with what looked like a load of sand. Ford shot up a wave. \"Hey, Bri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hey.\" With his thumbs in his front pockets, Brian strolled over and shot a meaningful look toward the house. \"And hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. Separate rooms. I didn\u0027t want her to be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s she doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems steadier this morning. She\u0027s already on her way to see Steve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shanna called the hospital. No change yet. It\u0027s the damnedest thing. Hell of a nice guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Ford looked over at the barn. \"How much paint do you figure it\u0027d take to do that barn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I know. Ask a painter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" He glanced over as another car pulled up. \"This place is a madhouse half the time. I\u0027m going home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cops.\" Brian jerked his chin. \"Cops\u0027re back. I hope to hell they don\u0027t want to talk to Shanna again. It gets her going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see if I can take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of the men who stepped out of the Crown Vic were the cop- Taney, Ford remembered-they\u0027d talked to the day before. Neither of them wore a uniform, and instead sported suits and ties. Detectives, he assumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe taller of the two, with snow-salted gray hair and prominent jowls, gave Ford a curt nod. The second, small, lean and black, eyed him coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd both, he noted, stared down at the dog that stared up at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla-Miss McGowan\u0027s-not home,\" Ford began. \"She left for the hospital about fifteen, twenty minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTall White Guy studied him. \"And you\u0027d be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sawyer. Ford Sawyer. I live across the road. I spoke with Officer Taney yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live across the road, but you stayed here last night. With Miss McGowan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord sipped his coffee, met Short Black Guy\u0027s eyes while Spock grumbled. \"Is that a statement or a question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your hair\u0027s still wet from the shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it is.\" Ford offered an easy smile, then sipped his coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTall White Guy took out a notebook, flipped pages. \"Can you tell us where you were night before last, between two and five A.M.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Would you mind doing the ID thing? It\u0027s not just for TV\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Urick, and my partner, Detective Wilson,\" Tall White Guy said as they both produced their badges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I was in bed-over there-from about one A.M. until I heard the sirens yesterday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Spock.\" He gestured at the dog. \"You could take a statement from him, but I\u0027d have to translate so it probably wouldn\u0027t work. Look, I get you have to check out everything and everyone, but the fact is somebody was out here a few nights before. I saw somebody skulking around with a flashlight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got that.\" Urick nodded. \"You\u0027re the only one who claims to have seen anything. What\u0027s your relationship with Miss McGowan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord beamed an exaggerated country-rube grin. \"Friends and neighbors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have the impression, from other sources, that your relationship is more than friendly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027d like it to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ford blew out a breath, Spock began to circle the cops. He wouldn\u0027t bite, but Ford knew if irritated enough, Spock would sure as hell lift his leg and express his opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad idea-probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spock, say hello. Sorry, he\u0027s feeling a little irritated and ignored. If you\u0027d take a minute and shake, he\u0027ll settle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilson crouched, took the paw. \"How\u0027s it going? Damnedest-looking dog I ever saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got some bull terrier in there,\" Urick commented, and leaned down to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, at least that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been told. Okay, back to would I like it to be more than friends and neighbors. Have you seen Cilla? Met her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, you\u0027d know I\u0027d have to be stupid not to like it to be. What does that have to do with Steve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrick gave Spock an absent scratch before straightening. \"Miss McGowan\u0027s ex-husband, staying with her. Three\u0027s a crowd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, only if you\u0027re stupid. But you\u0027ve made it clear that none of what happened was an accident.\" Ford turned, studied the barn. \"Somebody was in there, and whoever it was fractured Steve\u0027s skull and left him there. Just left him there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of that, just the thought of that stirred the rage he\u0027d managed to hold still and quiet. \"Son of a bitch. What the hell were they looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think someone was looking for anything?\" Urick demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord\u0027s eyes were cold green ice when he turned back. \"Give me a fucking break. Not some scavenger, either, not some asshole poking around trying to score a pair of Janet Hardy\u0027s shoes to sell on eBay. That doesn\u0027t follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve given this some thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think a lot. Listen, look at me as long as you want, as hard as you want. If you\u0027ve got more questions, I\u0027ll be around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find you, if and when,\" Wilson called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt about it, Ford thought as he headed for home with his dog. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-11.html","bookId":2414,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM"}
