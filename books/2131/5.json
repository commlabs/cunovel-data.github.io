She faded back to the Astral plane, her home, where her wounds would better heal. He saw that Regis and his unexpected giant ally had moved out of sight, and that Wulfgar and Catti-brie were moving to join Bruenor down at the lower ledge to the south, where the last of the enemy giants had fallen. The dark elf began picking his way to join them. At first, he thought he might have to backtrack all the way around to his initial position with Wulfgar, but using his incredible agility and the strength of fingers trained for decades in the maneuvering skills of sword play, he somehow found enough ledges, cracks, and simple angled surfaces to get down beside his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he got there, all three had entered the cave at the back of the shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned things might\u0027ve kept a bit more treasure if they\u0027re meanin\u0027 to put up such a fight,\" he heard Bruenor complaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps that\u0027s why they were scouting out the road,\" Catti-brie replied. \"Might it have been better for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eye if we went at them on our way back from Cadderly\u0027s place? Perhaps then we\u0027d\u0027ve found more treasure to yer liking. And maybe a few merchant skulls to go along with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" the dwarf snorted, drawing a wide smile from Drizzt. Few in all the Realms needed treasure less than Bruenor Battlehammer, Eighth King of Mithral Hall (despite his chosen absence from the place) and also leader of a lucrative mining colony in Icewind Dale. But that wasn\u0027t the point of Bruenor\u0027s ire, Drizzt understood, and he smiled all the wider as Bruenor confirmed his suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind o\u0027 wicked god\u0027d put ye against such powerful foes and not even reward ye with a bit o\u0027 gold?\" the dwarf grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did find some gold,\" Catti-brie reminded him. Drizzt, entering the cave, noted that she held a fairly substantial sack that bulged with coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor flashed the drow a disgusted look. \"Copper mostly,\" he grumbled. \"Three gold coins, a pair o\u0027 silver, and nothing more but stinkin\u0027 copper!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the road is safe,\" Drizzt said. He looked to Wulfgar as he spoke, but the big man would not match his stare. The drow tried hard not to pass any judgment over his tormented friend. Wulfgar should have led Drizzt\u0027s charge to the shelf. Never before had he so failed Drizzt in their tandem combat. But the drow knew that the barbarian\u0027s hesitance came not from any desire to see Drizzt injured nor, certainly, any cowardice. Wulfgar spun in emotional turmoil, the depths of which Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had never before seen. He had known of these problems before coaxing the barbarian out for this hunt, so he could not rightly place any blame now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor did he want to. He only hoped that the fight itself, after Wulfgar had become involved, had helped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe man to rid himself of some of those inner demons, had run the horse, as Montolio would have called it, just a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about yerself?\" Bruenor roared, bouncing over to stand before Drizzt. \"What\u0027re ye about, going off on yer own without a word to the rest of us? Ye thinking all the fun\u0027s for yerself, elf? Ye thinking that me and me girl can\u0027t be helpin\u0027 ye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not want to trouble you with so minor a battle,\" Drizzt calmly replied, painting a disarming smile on his dark face. \"I knew that we would be in the mountains, outside and not under them, in terrain not suited for the likes of a short-limbed dwarf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor wanted to hit him. Drizzt could see that in the way the dwarf was trembling. \"Bah!\" he roared instead, throwing up his hands and walking back for the exit to the small cave. \"Ye\u0027re always doin\u0027 that, ye stinkin\u0027 elf. Always going about on yer own and taking all the fun. But we\u0027ll find more on the road, don\u0027t ye doubt! And ye better be hopin\u0027 that ye see it afore me, or I\u0027ll cut \u0027em all down afore ye ever get them sissy blades outta their sheaths or that stinkin\u0027 cat outta that statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless they\u0027re too much for us. ...\" he continued, his voice trailing away as he moved out of the cave. \"Then I just might let ye have \u0027em all to yerself, ye stinkin\u0027 elf!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar, without a word and without a look at Drizzt, moved out next, leaving the drow and Catti-brie alone. Drizzt was chuckling now as Bruenor continued to grumble, but when he looked at Catti-brie, he saw that she was truly not amused, her feelings obviously hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking that a poor excuse,\" she remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to bring Wulfgar out alone,\" Drizzt explained. \"To bring him back to a different place and time, before all the trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ye\u0027re not thinkin\u0027 that me dad, or meself, might want to be helping with that?\" Catti-brie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted no one here that Wulfgar might fear needed protecting,\" Drizzt explained, and Catti-brie slumped back, her jaw dropping open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I speak only the truth, and you see it clearly,\" Drizzt went on. \"You remember how Wulfgar acted toward you before the fight with the yochlol. He was protective to the point of becoming a detriment to any battle cause. How could I rightly ask you to join us out here now, when that previous scenario might have repeated, leaving Wulfgar, perhaps, in an even worse emotional place than when we set out? That is why I did not ask Bruenor or Regis, either. Wulfgar, Guenhwyvar, and I would fight the giants, as we did that time so long ago in Icewind Dale. And maybe, just maybe, he would remember things the way they had been before his unwelcome tenure with Errtu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie\u0027s expression softened, and she bit her lower lip as she nodded her agreement. \"And did it work?\" she asked. \"Suren the fight went well, and Wulfgar fought well and honestly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s gaze drifted out the exit. \"He made a mistake,\" the drow admitted. \"Though surely he compensated as the battle progressed. It is my hope that Wulfgar will forgive himself his initial hesitance and focus on the actual fight where he performed wonderfully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hesitance?\" Catti-brie asked skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we first began the battle,\" Drizzt started to explain, but he waved his hand dismissively as if it did not really matter. \"It has been many years since we have fought together. It was an excusable miscue, nothing more.\" In truth, Drizzt had a hard time dismissing the fact that Wulfgar\u0027s hesitance had almost cost him and Guenhwyvar dearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re in a generous mood,\" the ever-perceptive Cattibrie remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is my hope that Wulfgar will remember who he is and who his friends truly are,\" the drow ranger replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yer hope,\" Catti-brie echoed. \"But is it your expectation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt continued to stare out the exit. He could only shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four were out of the ravine and back on the trail shortly after, and Bruenor\u0027s grumbling about Drizzt turned into complaining about Regis. \"Where in the Nine Hells is Rumblebelly?\" the dwarf bellowed. \"And how in the Nine Hells did he ever get a giant to throw rocks for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he spoke, they felt the vibrations of heavy, heavy footfalls beneath their feet and heard a silly song sung in unison. There was a happy halfling voice, Regis, and a second voice that rumbled like the thunder of a rockslide. A moment later, Regis came around a bend in the northern trail, riding on the giant\u0027s shoulder, the two of them singing and laughing with every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" Regis said happily when he steered the giant to join his friends. He noted that Drizzt had his hands on his scimitars, though they were sheathed (and that meant little for the lightning-fast drow), Bruenor clutched tightly to his axe, Catti-brie to her bow, and Wulfgar, holding Aegis-fang, seemed as if he was about to explode into murderous action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Junger,\" Regis explained. \"He was not with the other band-he says he doesn\u0027t even know them. And he is a smart one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunger put a hand up to secure Regis\u0027s seat, then bowed low before the stunned group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, Junger does not even go down to the road, does not go out of the mountains at all,\" Regis explained. \"Says he has no interest in the affairs of dwarves or men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He telled ye that, did he?\" Bruenor asked doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis nodded, his smile wide. \"And I believe him,\" he said, waggling the ruby pendant, whose magical hypnotizing properties were well known to the friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That don\u0027t change a thing,\" Bruenor said with a growl, looking to Drizzt as if expecting the ranger to start the fight. A giant was a giant, after all, to the dwarf\u0027s way of thinking, and any giant looked much better lying down with an axe firmly embedded in its skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Junger is no killer,\" Regis said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only goblins,\" the huge giant said with a smile. \"And hill giants. And orcs, of course, for who could abide the ugly things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sophisticated dialect and his choice of enemies had the dwarf staring at him wide-eyed. \"And yeti,\" Bruenor said. \"Don\u0027t ye be forgettin\u0027 yeti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, not yeti,\" Junger replied. \"I do not kill yeti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scowl returned to Bruenor\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, one cannot even eat the smelly things,\" Junger explained. \"I do not kill them, I domesticate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye what?\" Bruenor demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Domesticate them,\" Junger explained. \"Like a dog or a horse. Oh, but I\u0027ve quite a selection of yeti workers at my cave back in the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor turned an incredulous expression on Drizzt, but the ranger, as much at a loss as the dwarf, only shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve lost too much time already,\" Catti-brie remarked. \"Camlaine and the others\u0027ll be halfway out o\u0027 the dale afore we catch them. Be rid o\u0027 yer friend, Regis, and let us get to the trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis was shaking his head before she ever finished. \"Junger does not usually leave the mountains,\" he explained. \"But he will for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll not have to carry you anymore,\" Wulfgar grumbled, walking away. \"Good enough for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re not having to carry him anyway,\" Bruenor replied, then looked back to Regis. \"I\u0027m thinking ye can do yer own walking. Ye don\u0027t need a giant to act as a horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than that,\" Regis said, beaming. \"A bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf and Catti-brie both groaned; Drizzt only chuckled and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In every fight, I spend more time trying to keep out of the way,\" Regis explained. \"Never am I any real help. But with Junger-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027ll still be trying to keep outta the way,\" Bruenor interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Junger is to fight for you, then he is no more than any of the rest of us,\" Drizzt added. \"Are we, then, merely bodyguards of Regis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not,\" the halfling replied. \"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be rid of him,\" Catti-brie said. \"Wouldn\u0027t we look the fine band of friendly travelers walking into Luskan beside a mountain giant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll walk in with a drow,\" Regis answered before he could think about it, then blushed a deep shade of red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Drizzt only chuckled and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put him down,\" Bruenor said to Junger. \"I think he\u0027s needin\u0027 a talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mustn\u0027t hurt my friend Regis,\" Junger replied. \"That I simply cannot allow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor snorted. \"Put \u0027im down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a look to Regis, who held a stubborn pose for a few moments longer, Junger complied. He set the halfling gently on the ground before Bruenor, who reached as if to grab Regis by the ear, but then glanced up, up, up at Junger and thought the better of it. \"Ye\u0027re not thinkin\u0027, Rumblebelly,\" the dwarf said quietly, leading Regis away. \"What happens if the big damned thing finds its way outta yer ruby spell? He\u0027ll squish ye flat afore any o\u0027 us can stop him, and I\u0027m not thinking I\u0027d try to stop him if I could, since ye\u0027d be deserving the flattening!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis started to argue, but he remembered the first moments of his encounter with Junger, when the huge giant had proclaimed that he liked his rodents smashed. The little halfling couldn\u0027t deny the fact that a single step from Junger would indeed mash him, and the hold of the ruby pendant was ever tentative. He turned and walked back from Bruenor and bade Junger to go back to his home in the deep mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant smiled-and shook his head. \"I hear it,\" he said cryptically. \"So I shall stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear what?\" Regis and Bruenor asked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a call,\" Junger assured them. \"It tells me that I should go along with you to serve Regis and protect him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye hit him good with that thing, didn\u0027t ye now?\" Bruenor whispered at the halfling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need no protecting,\" Regis said firmly to the giant. \"Though we all thank you for your help in the fight. You can go back to your home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Junger shook his head. \"Better that I go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor glowered at Regis, and the halfling had no explanation. As far as he could tell, Junger was still under the spell of the pendant-the fact that Regis was still alive seemed evidence of that-yet the behemoth was clearly disobeying him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you can come along,\" Drizzt said to the surprise of them all. \"Yes, but if you mean to join us, then perhaps your pet tundra yetis might prove invaluable. How long will it take you to retrieve them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three days at the most,\" Junger replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, go then, and be quick about it,\" Regis said, hopping up and down and wriggling the ruby pendant at the end of its chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed to satisfy the giant. It bowed low then bounded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should\u0027ve killed the thing here and now,\" Bruenor said. \"Now it\u0027ll come back in three days and find us long gone, then it\u0027ll likely take its damned smelly yetis and go down hunting on the road!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he told me he never goes out of the mountains,\" Regis reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough of this foolishness,\" Catti-brie demanded. \"The thing\u0027s gone, and so should we all be.\" None offered an argument to that, so they set off at once, Drizzt purposely falling into line beside Regis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it all the call of the ruby pendant?\" the ranger asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Junger told me that he was farther from home than he had been in a long, long time,\" Regis admitted. \"He said he heard a call on the wind and went to answer it. I guess he thought I was the caller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt accepted that explanation. If Junger continued to fall for the simple ruse, they would be around the edge of the Spine of the World, rushing fast along a better road, before the behemoth ever returned to this spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed Junger was running fast in the direction of his relatively lavish mountain home, and it struck the giant as curious, for just a moment, that he had ever left the place. In his younger days, Junger had been a wanderer, living meal to meal on whatever prey he could find. He snickered now when he considered all that he had told the foolish little halfling, for Junger had indeed once feasted on the meat of humans, and even on a halfling once. The truth was, he shunned such meals now as much because he didn\u0027t like the taste as because he thought it better not to make such powerful enemies as humans. Wizards in particular scared him. Of course, to find human or halfling meat, Junger had to leave his mountain home, and that he never liked to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t have come out at all this time had not a call on the wind, something he still did not quite understand, compelled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Junger had all he wanted at his home: plenty of food, obedient servants, and comfortable furs. He had no desire to ever leave the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had, and he understood that he would again, and though that seemed an incongruous thought to the not-stupid giant, it was one that he simply couldn\u0027t pause to consider. Not now, not with the constant buzzing in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would get the yetis, he knew, and then return, following the instructions of the call on the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call of Crenshinibon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-5.html","bookId":2131,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:51 PM"}
