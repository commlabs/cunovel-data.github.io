{"id":110533,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t supposed to be here. I was looking in the offices. I was curious. Nobody is ever supposed to come down here.\" She latched suddenly on to Mortimer\u0027s arm. \"Please, we have to go. If she catches us here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer shook his arm loose, stepped up to the wall, ran his hand along its surface. Knocked. The material was thin, flimsy. \"This is cardboard painted to look like the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer shoved, and the wall shook; the ship picture fell, frame glass shattering on the floor. Ruth started, yelped. He pushed the wall again, and the cardboard structure flopped over. Light streamed in, and Mortimer flinched. He pushed on, kicking the wall down until it was flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallway led to a glass door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to it, pulled. Locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer looked for a place to try the keys he\u0027d found in the doctor\u0027s desk. No luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth put her hands flat against the glass, looked through to the other side. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some kind of reception area. Or maybe a security checkpoint,\" Mortimer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a counter, a phone and two cheap office chairs in a small waiting area. Half the lights still worked. Mortimer jerked on the door, but it wouldn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet this is it,\" Mortimer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way out. Wait here.\" He jogged back down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" A hint of alarm in Ruth\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the dead man\u0027s office, Mortimer picked up the fire extinguisher he\u0027d used to bash open the padlock. He hefted it, feeling its weight. Probably he could smash through the glass door with it. He turned to run back down the hall. Paused. He set the extinguisher down, entered the office again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the corpse, still clutching the panties, imagined a macabre smile of perverse satisfaction across the mummified face. Mortimer\u0027s gaze shifted downward, came to rest on the plastic I.D. badge hanging from a frayed cord. Mortimer grabbed it quickly, yanked, and it came loose. He ran back down the hall and found Ruth squatting small and quiet against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took Mortimer a second to find the slot. He inserted the plastic I.D. Nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Ruth got to her feet, stood close to Mortimer. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer turned the I.D. card around so the magnetic strip faced the other way. He inserted it again. The slot buzzed sluggishly, a green light flickering and struggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" He jammed the card in harder, slammed the slot with the heel of his other hand. \"Work, you piece of shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green light buzzed. An audible click from the glass door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it. Quick!\" ordered Mortimer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth pulled the door open and held it. Mortimer put the I.D. card in his pocket, raced through the door, pulling Ruth after him. \"Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it, thought Mortimer. The way out. Mother Lola had kept it hidden, kept all her little subjects trapped in her morbid little kingdom. But they\u0027d made it through. They ran down a long hall, Mortimer\u0027s heart thumping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! What\u0027s that?\" Ruth halted abruptly, pulled on Mortimer\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey held their breath, listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind they heard movement, hard footfalls on a tile floor, muffled voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, they\u0027re coming.\" Ruth\u0027s eyes shot wide with animal panic. \"Mother Lola knows. She\u0027s coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry!\" Mortimer pulled her forward, ran down the long hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned a corner, saw a smear of daylight. Double doors leading to the outside. They ran. Ruth faltered, almost stumbled, but Mortimer jerked her upright and kept running. Flashlight beams behind them now, harsh shouts to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t look back, hit the doors at a run, bright sunlight washing over them as they erupted into the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run for it!\" Mortimer let go of her wrist, ran full speed for open ground. \"We can make it,\" he shouted into the wind. \"Keep running!\" He turned his head, expected to see her sprinting for her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, turned, saw her still only a few yards from the hospital entrance. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I can\u0027t...\" She took three halting steps, then froze, shut her eyes tight, put her hands in the air as if fending off some unseen ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer ran back, grabbed her, started running again. It was like pulling a sack of bowling balls. But then she jogged, tried to keep up, Mortimer pulling and urging her. Abruptly she fell to the ground, sliding out of his grip. She curled into a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you fucking kidding me?\" He grabbed under her armpits, attempted to hoist her up. She went limp, dripped from his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t...I didn\u0027t know.\" She shook her head, the words coming breathless. \"I didn\u0027t know it would be like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her, ran sluggishly with her a hundred yards before they fell into a pile. Mortimer panted, gulped for air, his breath steaming in the cold. \"What the hell is your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too much,\" she gasped. \"I didn\u0027t know it would be so big. I can\u0027t do it. It\u0027s so much. So open.\" She put her hands over her head like she was trying to fend off the sky, gigantic open spaces threatening to crush her into the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer stood, looked back at the hospital entrance. Three women stood in the doorway. Mother Lola with a fox fur around her neck, two women flanking her. Both holding bows and arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unhand her, vile abductor,\" bellowed Mother Lola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer dropped next to Ruth, whispered in her ear, \"We have to go right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. It\u0027s too much. There\u0027s nothing between me and...and...\" She waved a frantic hand at the sky. \"Everything.\" She staggered to her feet, ran for the hospital. \"I have to get back inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy?\" Mortimer leapt, tackled her around the ankles. They both went down, Ruth screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked at him, writhed, twisted from his grip. She was up again and running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer started after her when an arrow landed with a meaty thwock in his upper thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy fucking shit, that hurts!\" He hopped on one leg, gritting his teeth and uttering curses. He grabbed the shaft, pulled the arrow out with relative ease. A nonbarbed target arrow. It hadn\u0027t penetrated deeply, but it stung like a son of a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer yelled, \"Ruth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t turn, fled weeping into the arms of Mother Lola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood a moment looking at the women and the hospital, vines creeping up the building on all sides as if the earth were trying to swallow it whole. He saw Mother Lola and Ruth disappear back into the darkness within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother arrow whizzed over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay. I can take a hint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer limped away as fast as he could. They didn\u0027t chase him. Maybe his seed wasn\u0027t so desirable after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold tore at Mortimer\u0027s bare ankles, whooshed up his pant legs to do fierce, shrinking things to his genitalia. He shivered and trudged, favoring the leg with the shallow arrow wound. The winding, narrow road twisted and curved through the forest away from Saint Sebastian\u0027s and toward nowhere he could guess. He assumed the asphalt would eventually take him to some village or town. He\u0027d settle for a farmhouse where he might beg a scrap of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not shake the sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ruth. Poor girl. What should he have done for her? Ultimately another victim of the world\u0027s implosion. After growing up in her sterile cocoon, how could she possibly face the unyielding totality of an entire planet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe she was just a wack-doodle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer hugged himself tighter, trudged on, tried to keep his teeth from chattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed three dead farmhouses before he realized it might be a good idea to scavenge. Even if he didn\u0027t find food, he might possibly find something warmer to wear. He might even stay in one of the abandoned dwellings for the night and try to get a fire going somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next two farmhouses produced nothing of value. In the third, Mortimer attempted to pull down a thick set of yellow drapes to use as a blanket, but the material disintegrated in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy evening, he was exhausted and starving. His feet hurt, and every muscle ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next farmhouse had no front door, all the windows smashed out. He found only barren rooms and hard wooden floors inside. There was a fireplace but nothing he could use to start a fire. He\u0027d read a number of frontier guides that demonstrated how to build a fire without matches, but he couldn\u0027t remember anything that would allow him to strike a spark out of thin air with his bare hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom, he found a dirty plastic shower curtain still hanging. He tore it down and used it as a blanket. Mortimer spent a long uncomfortable night in the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery limb was sore and stiff when he awoke. The leg with the arrow wound was the worst. Not for the first time, Mortimer thought how much simpler and safer and more comfortable it would have been to stay in his cave. Or he could have stayed in Spring City, bought back his house from the crazy old lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of tracking down his wife seemed useless and arbitrary now. And yet Mortimer could not quite picture himself turning back, living easily and without direction, drinking his fortune at the Spring City Joey Armageddon\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretched, stomped the feeling back into his legs and hit the road again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more farmhouses and still nothing. He felt he might soon eat his shoes if he didn\u0027t find food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arrived at a larger county road that crossed his at a T intersection. This would certainly lead to some kind of town, and Mortimer brightened microscopically. Another farmhouse sat at the head of the T intersection. Maybe Mortimer would get lucky. He went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing he saw was the dead body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer was still not quite used to seeing dead bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpse sat at a desk. The desk faced the front door. The dead man had fallen forward. He clutched a revolver in his stiff, dead hands. He didn\u0027t look quite as mummified as the dead doctor back at Saint Sebastian\u0027s, but he\u0027d clearly been there a long time. A brown-red bullet hole above his right temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t take it, and he shot himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer\u0027s eyes fixed on the gun. It was like finding a bar of gold. Next to the man\u0027s head was an ashtray with a book of matches in it. Fire! And what was that on the end of the desk? Ravioli. A fucking can of Chef Boyardee Overstuffed Ravioli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer almost flew to the desk, arms outstretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floor vanished out from under him. Falling. Flailing limbs. Rope tight across his face. He was tangled, swaying, bobbing up and down in the musty darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few seconds, Mortimer stopped his struggling, tried to turn his head and assess his situation. He hung upside down in a large net. That much was obvious. A trapdoor must have dropped him into a net, and he now hung in the basement below. The only light came from the still-open trapdoor above. He craned his neck, tried to see what was in the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBodies. Dozens of dead bodies in a pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh...shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard something and froze. It had sounded like a bell. He struggled, heard the bell again and froze again. Experimentally, he twisted and shifted in the net. The bell sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s connected to the net, he thought. Come and get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe renewed his struggles more frantically. He had to get out before they came. Whoever the hell they were. Mortimer didn\u0027t want to find out. He managed to struggle right side up, reached up between the thick net ropes to see if he could feel how the thing was put together. Maybe he could untie it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps up above, the wooden floor creaking. Mortimer held his breath. A black silhouette appeared against the square of light above him, stood at the edge and looked down at him through the trapdoor. Mortimer saw the vague outline of a firearm cradled in the man\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got any weapons?\" called a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silhouette turned his head to answer. \"Nope. Go get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother set of footsteps crossed the floor. The sound of a door swinging on rusty hinges, followed by the muffled clomp of boots coming down stairs. A door swung open, and light flooded the basement. A man in jeans and a heavy flannel shirt approached Mortimer. He was pale, red hair, medium height, small black eyes and yellow teeth spread out with gaps. Late twenties. On his shoulder rested a wooden baseball bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna let you down, okay? You try anything, I\u0027ll bash you good with this.\" He hefted the bat. \"You understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked up at the silhouette. \"Bobby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby shifted the firearm to point at Mortimer. \"I got him covered. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bat wielder went to the wall, untied a rope and slowly lowered the net to the basement floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Untangle yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer spread the opening in the top of the net, shimmied out of it as he stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore footsteps up above, the quick patter of high heels. A woman\u0027s voice. \"Did you get one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one called Bobby said, \"Just stay back, Sue Ellen. We got it handled. Floyd\u0027s down there with him now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFloyd said, \"You want me to search him down here or bring-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer bolted for the stairs, ignoring the pain of his leg wound. He got three steps before feeling the sharp smack at the base of his skull. He went to his knees, his head swimming, eyes going unfocused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you not to fucking do that, asshole.\" Floyd\u0027s voice sounded like it was down a well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got him?\" Bobby called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I got him all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother smack to the back of the head and everything went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer awoke with the sensation he had only been unconscious a minute or two. The back of his head throbbed. He turned to look into the eyes of a sallow, glassy-eyed corpse. His suit jacket and shirt were off, and the cement floor was cold on his back. He was barefoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his head, saw a woman holding his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be Sue Ellen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, shouted up the stairs. \"He\u0027s awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer wished he wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoots hammered down the stairs while the girl looked down at Mortimer. She was a sight. An emerald-green cocktail dress, a big white sun hat, black silk gloves, fishnet stockings, satin pumps. She looked like she was auditioning for a community college production of Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face, pretty in a flat, plain sort of way, was ruddy, her brown eyes dull, her expression a bit too slack-jawed. She blinked at Mortimer, still holding his shoes. She didn\u0027t seem very concerned that Mortimer was conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was because Floyd and Bobby stood next to her now, Floyd with his baseball bat and Bobby with what Mortimer could now see was a single-barreled shotgun. Bobby had thinning hair the same red as Floyd\u0027s but a sharper, angular face and hard, probing eyes of bright blue. Like Floyd, he wore jeans and flannel shirts in layers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them gawked at Mortimer like he was a farm animal with a mildly interesting disfigurement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do with me?\" Mortimer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby shrugged. \"Don\u0027t know yet. Sue Ellen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing hidden in his shoes,\" she said. \"And I already went through his pants pockets. I\u0027ll look in the jacket.\" She picked it up, started turning the pockets out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go,\" Mortimer said. \"I don\u0027t have anything you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Floyd told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If nothing else we can put him on the bicycle line,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFloyd pointed at Mortimer\u0027s thigh with the bat. \"He\u0027s got a bum leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll heal up okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSue Ellen squealed. \"It was in his jacket pocket.\" She held up the pink plastic card she\u0027d found. \"Wow. A Platinum member.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby sighed. \"Hell. Okay, then. Give him back his shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDINNER AND ENTERTAINMENT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all hopped aboard the wagon and started up the county road. For a while, Mortimer could not take his eyes off the mule pulling them. He\u0027d seen no horses or cows or sheep or livestock of any kind. Perhaps the mule\u0027s mangy, decrepit state had kept it from being eaten. Even as starved as Mortimer felt, the animal did not look appetizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wagon rocked back and forth. They clip-clopped up the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you taking me?\" Mortimer asked at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joey Armageddon\u0027s,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? All the way back to Spring City?\" The mule would never make it. Maybe he\u0027d end up eating it after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell no,\" Bobby said. \"The new one in Cleveland.
