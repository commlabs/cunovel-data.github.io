The sort of day that inspires confidence in the state of the world. If Taylor had been back home, she would have considered it a perfect tanning day and gone for a fresh coat of color. But she had more important things to think about just now. She had work to do, and as she worked, she hummed an old show tune. It was a song she had used in a previous pageant, a song about how you couldn’t get a man with a gun, which was silly — of course you could get just about anything with a gun! But it calmed her to sing it now as she attached the red, blue, and white wires to the statue of Miss Miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly stars, but she’d had a busy few days! After attacking the guards, she’d relieved them of their weapons and buried them in a shallow storage pit beneath Our Lady. The trip wires had not been easy to rig. She’d had to go deeper into the jungle to find vines that were strong enough, and she’d had to make sure they were low enough to the ground so as not to be seen. One wrong step and that person would be hoisted high into the trees to dangle by a foot until they passed out or Taylor felt merciful, whichever came first. Probably the passing out. She’d dug two deep holes. These she covered with leaves and branches and marked with tiny crosses so that she would remember not to step there. But oh, there was so much to do still. It was just like getting ready for pageant time, and it filled Taylor with a happy sense of purpose. Ever since getting shot by those darts, Taylor had had a teensy bit of trouble organizing her thoughts. That’s what lists were for. When Taylor competed, she always made lists. They were very helpful. She made one now in her head. It went like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelt down jewelry for arrowheads\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDig pit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurveillance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstruct bows\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterview portion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProjectile launch/avocado mask\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReassemble AK-47\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstruct bomb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoisturize\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, lists were essential if you were going to be a serious competitor. And nobody was more serious about competing than Taylor Rene Krystal Hawkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss Texas, who’s got her wires crossed,” Ladybird Hope cautioned. She’d changed into a sarong and put a flower in her hair, which was, of course, just perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my stars!” Taylor rethreaded the wires. She shook her head at her clumsiness. “That’s almost like wearing red for evening gown. Everybody knows the judges like pastels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amen.” Ladybird Hope peeled a banana. She had a French manicure. “You’re gonna need a what next, Taylor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An accelerant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor opened the jar of Lady ’Stache Off cream and put it in position. Under the label, the jar had a small radioactive symbol. “There. This Miss is ready to greet her subjects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLadybird Hope patted Taylor lightly on the back. “I’m so proud of you, Taylor. You really are a Miss Teen Dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just hearing that from you, Ladybird, well, it’s like I’ve already won.” Taylor’s eyes misted with tears. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-96.html","bookId":2717,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
