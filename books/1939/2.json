The noise from the television blaring above the bar seemed to fade into the background. Every muscle in my body tensed, almost as if I knew what Ritchie was about to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said the doctors had delivered bad news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focused on an empty bar stool on the other side of the room. \"I wanted to cancel dinner. Hannah wouldn\u0027t let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had a good reason for wanting to come that night,\" Ritchie explained. \"She told me there wasn\u0027t any hope left and she\u0027d accepted that she was going to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t in the mood to hear this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie exhaled loudly. \"She wasn\u0027t afraid of dying, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should she be? Heaven was made for people like Hannah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie nodded, agreeing with me. \"She\u0027d made her peace with God long before that night. She never had a fatalistic attitude. She wanted to live. More than anything, she wanted to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one time I\u0027d doubted that. \"I begged her to let me take her to Europe because I\u0027d read about an experimental treatment there. She wouldn\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was too late,\" Ritchie said simply. His hand tightened around the beer bottle. \"She knew it even if we didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Hannah--not only was she wise, but forever practical. While she was willing to accept the inevitable, I clung to every shred of hope. I spent hours studying medical journals, calling specialists, doing online research. But my crazed efforts to cure her didn\u0027t make any difference. In the end Hannah had been right; she\u0027d reached the point of no return. She died less than two months later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now I was shocked by how quickly she slipped away. It was the only time in our marriage that I became truly angry with her. I wanted Hannah to fight the cancer. I shouted and paced and slammed my fist against the wall. Gently she took my bleeding knuckles between her own hands and kissed away the pain. What she didn\u0027t seem to understand was that no amount of tenderness would ease the ache of her leaving me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought our meals, but I couldn\u0027t have swallowed a single bite had my life depended on it. Ritchie apparently felt the same because his steak remained untouched for several minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah asked me to give you this,\" my brother-in-law finally said. He pulled an envelope from his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me to wait until she\u0027d been gone a year. Then and only then was I to hand this over to you. It was the last thing my sister asked of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at Ritchie, hardly able to believe he\u0027d kept this from me. We worked out at the gym three mornings a week and had for years. In all these months he\u0027d never let on that he had this letter in his possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The night of the dinner party I promised Hannah I\u0027d give you this,\" Ritchie said. \"I put the letter in our safetydeposit box and waited, just like she wanted me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing what to say or how to react, I took the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the sports bar soon after. I don\u0027t remember driving home. One minute I was in the parking garage in downtown Seattle and the next time I was aware of anything I\u0027d reached the house and was sitting in my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027d gone inside, I dropped my keys on the kitchen counter and walked into the living room. I sat on the edge of the sofa and stared at the envelope. Hannah had written one word on the front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my name, mesmerized as grief rippled through me. Unbelievable though it seemed, it felt as if her love for me vibrated off the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand shook as I turned over the envelope and carefully opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know how long I stared at the letter before I found the courage to unfold it. It consisted of four sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI The first thing I noticed was the date. March 13. This was another date that had been burned in my memory-- the Friday of our appointment with the medical team, when we\u0027d received the devastating news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had written the letter that day? That was impossible. I\u0027d been with her every minute from the appointment until dinner with Ritchie and Steph. That meant...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell back against the sofa cushion and closed my eyes. Hannah must have written the letter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore the appointment. She knew even before we got the final word. She\u0027d always known. In some way I think I did, too, only I couldn\u0027t face it. I\u0027d refused to accept what should have been evident. I returned my attention to the letter. She\u0027d written it by hand, her cursive elegant and flowing. I felt a visceral reaction to seeing her handwriting, which had once been so familiar. I tensed as if I\u0027d just taken a punch to the gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you and I apologize for that. It\u0027s been a year now and I imagine it\u0027s been a difficult one for you, as well as our parents and Ritchie. I would\u0027ve given anything to have spared you this grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven on the verge of death, Hannah didn\u0027t think of herself. Instead, she was thinking of me, our parents and her brother and how terribly we missed her and how deeply we\u0027d loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past few weeks I\u0027ve been giving serious thought to what I wanted to say and what my last words to you would be. Please bear with me as I have quite a lot on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know people laugh when they hear about love at first sight. I was only eighteen when we met, and young as I was, I knew instantly that you were the man I was going to love...and I have, from that moment forward. I will love you until the day I die and beyond. And in my heart I know you\u0027ll love me, too. I want to thank you for loving me. Your devotion to me through everything I\u0027ve undergone since the cancer was diagnosed has been the greatest gift of my life. You have made me so happy, Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes again, fearing I didn\u0027t have the emotional strength to continue. I knew when Ritchie handed me this letter that reading it would be hard, but I didn\u0027t know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow hard it was going to be. I dragged in a deep breath and went on. The early years of our marriage were some of the most wonderful days of my life. We had so little, and yet all we needed was each other. I loved you so much and was...am so proud of you, of the caring pediatrician you\u0027ve become. You were born to be a physician, Michael. And I was born to love you. Thank you for loving me back, for giving so much of yourself to me, especially during these past few months. You made them the very best months of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to die, Michael. I fought this, I honestly did. I gave it everything in me. Nothing would have made me happier than to grow old with you. I\u0027m so sorry that, for me, the end has to come so soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don\u0027t ever believe I had a defeatist attitude. When we first got the diagnosis, I was determined to fight this and win. It\u0027s just in the past week that I\u0027ve come to realize that this cancer is bigger than I am. There\u0027s no use pretending otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to stop reading a second time, regretting once more my insistence that Hannah travel to Europe for the experimental treatment I\u0027d wanted her to receive. It\u0027d been far too late by then. I took a moment to compose myself, then went back to her letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve asked Ritchie to give you this a year after my death. Knowing you as well as I do, I suspect you\u0027ve buried yourself in work. My guess is that you spend twelve hours a day at the office, eating on the run. That isn\u0027t a healthy lifestyle, my darling. I do hope you\u0027re still meeting Ritchie at the gym three times a week. I smiled. Yes, Hannah knew everything about me. Right down to the long hours and skipped meals. I\u0027d tried to quit my exercise regime, too, just like I\u0027d dropped Thursday-night poker with the guys. But Ritchie wouldn\u0027t let me. It became easier to show up than to find an excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks after Hannah\u0027s funeral he arrived on my doorstep in his workout clothes and dragged me back to the gym. A couple of early-morning calls from my brotherin-law, and I decided I couldn\u0027t fend him off anymore, so our workout became part of my routine once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis next section of my letter is the most painful for me to write. Although it hurts, I have to accept that there\u0027s no hope now. I suppose it\u0027s only natural when facing one\u0027s mortality that regrets surface, along with the knowledge that the end is close. The greatest of those regrets is my inability to have children. This is harder for me than even the discovery that my cancer is terminal. I so badly wanted your baby, Michael. A child for my sake, yes, but yours, too. You should be a father. You will be a wonderful father. Oh, Michael, I so wanted a child. Once more I was forced to stop reading as a lump formed in my throat. \"I wanted a child, too,\" I whispered. I rested the letter on my knee and wondered if I could finish without giving in to the weakness of tears. And yet I had to read on. I had to know Hannah\u0027s last wordstome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have one final request of you, my darling, and I hope you will honor it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything.\" I would do anything for Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I want, what I need from you, is this, my dearest love. I want you to marry again. I gasped. No way! I\u0027d already thought about this, and I couldn\u0027t do it. I\u0027d had the love of my life and I\u0027d be foolish to believe it could happen twice. If I did remarry, I\u0027d be cheating the new woman I pledged to love. I\u0027d be cheating us both because my heart would always belong to Hannah and only to Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see you shaking your head, insisting it isn\u0027t possible. Michael, I know you. I can almost hear your protests. But this is important, so please, please listen. Loving another woman won\u0027t diminish the love we had. Nor does it mean you\u0027ll love me any less. I will always be a part of you and you will remain a part of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing you must remember is that my life\u0027s journey is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have a lot of living left to do and I don\u0027t want you to waste another moment grieving for me. You made me completely happy, and you\u0027ll make another woman equally so. I wasn\u0027t sure I agreed with Hannah, wasn\u0027t sure I was capable of loving another woman, not with the same intensity, the same depth. She didn\u0027t understand what she was asking of me. I had no desire for another woman, no desire to share my life with anyone else ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing how stubborn you are, I realize you\u0027re going to require a bit of help, so I\u0027ve compiled a short list of candidates for you to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? A list? Hannah had supplied me with a list of possible replacements? If it wasn\u0027t so shocking I would\u0027ve laughed. Still, curiosity got the better of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember Winter Adams, my cousin? She was a bridesmaid in our wedding. Winter has a big heart and she loves children. She\u0027d make you an excellent wife. She\u0027s also a chef and will cook you incredible meals. In addition to being my cousin, she\u0027s been a good friend. I want you to seriously consider her. Of course I remembered Winter. She and Hannah had been close. We hadn\u0027t seen as much of Winter after she opened her restaurant, the French Cafe on Blossom Street, not far from my office. Hannah and I had visited the cafe a few times and enjoyed coffee and croissants. I recalled her keeping in touch with Hannah, mostly by phone. If I remembered correctly, Winter had been going through some relationship crisis shortly before Hannah was diagnosed, and, Hannah, being Hannah, had offered her comfort and encouragement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter had been at the funeral and had doubled over in tears at the cemetery. I hadn\u0027t heard from her since, although I vaguely recalled a sympathy card she\u0027d sent me after we buried Hannah. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-2.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
