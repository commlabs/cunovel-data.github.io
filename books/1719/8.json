{"id":67878,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never felt ugly next to Lena, but suddenly I do. I feel tall and ugly and bony, like a straw-colored horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena starts to say something when there\u0027s a loud knock on the door that opens into the store, and Jed calls out, \"Lena? Are you in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively I shove Alex sideways so he stumbles behind the door just as it begins to open from the other side. Fortunately, Jed manages to get it open only a few inches before the door collides with a large crate of applesauce. I wonder, fleetingly, whether Lena placed it there for that purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me, I can feel Alex: He is both very alert and very still, like an animal just before bolting. The door muffles the sound of Jed\u0027s voice. Lena keeps a smile on her face when she replies to him. I can\u0027t believe this is the same Lena who used to hyperventilate when she was asked to read in front of the class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach starts twisting, knotted up with conflicting admiration and resentment. All this time, I thought we were growing apart because I was leaving Lena behind. But really it was the reverse. She was learning to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was learning to love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t stand to be so close to this boy, this Invalid, who is now Lena\u0027s secret. My skin is itching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pop my head around the door. \"Hi, Jed,\" I say brightly. Lena gives me a grateful look. \"I just came by to give Lena something. And we started gossiping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have customers,\" Jed says dully, keeping his eyes locked on Lena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be out in a second,\" she says. When Jed withdraws again with a grunt, closing the door, Alex lets out a long breath. Jed\u0027s interruption has restored tension to the room. I can feel it crawling along my skin, like heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps sensing the tension, Alex kneels down and begins unpacking his backpack. \"I brought some things for your leg,\" he says quietly. He has brought medical supplies. When Lena rolls up one leg of her jeans to her knee, she reveals an ugly wound on the back of her calf. I feel a quick, swinging sense of vertigo and a surge of nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, Lena,\" I say, trying to keep my voice light. I don\u0027t want to freak her out. \"That dog got you good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be fine,\" Alex says dismissively, as though I shouldn\u0027t worry about it--as though it\u0027s none of my concern. I have the sudden urge to kick him Ke tissively in the back of his head. He is kneeling in front of Lena, dabbing antibacterial cream on her leg. I\u0027m mesmerized by the way his fingers move confidently along her skin, as though her body is his to treat and touch and tend to. She was mine before she was yours: The words are there, unexpectedly, surging from my throat to my tongue. I swallow them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should go to the hospital.\" I direct the words to Lena, but Alex jumps in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tell them what? That she got hurt during a raid on an underground party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he\u0027s right, but that doesn\u0027t stop me from feeling an irrational swell of resentment. I don\u0027t like the way he\u0027s acting as though he\u0027s the only one who knows what\u0027s good for Lena. I don\u0027t like the way she\u0027s looking at him like she agrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t hurt that bad.\" Lena\u0027s voice is gentle, mollifying, the voice of a parent soothing a stubborn child. Once again I have the sense that I am seeing her for the first time: She is like a figure behind a scrim, all silhouette and blur, and I barely recognize her. I can\u0027t stand to look at her anymore--Lena, a stranger--so I drop to my knees and practically elbow Alex out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing it wrong,\" I say. \"Let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" He shuffles out of the way without protest, but he stays crouched down, watching me work. I hope he won\u0027t notice that my hands are shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of nowhere, Lena starts laughing. I\u0027m so surprised, I almost drop the gauze right as I\u0027m in the middle of tying it off. When I look up at Lena, she\u0027s laughing so hard, she has to double forward and put a hand over her mouth to try to muffle the sound. Alex watches her soundlessly for a minute--he\u0027s probably just as shocked as I am--and then he, too, lets out a snort of laughter. Soon they\u0027re both cracking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I start laughing too. The absurdity of the situation hits me all at once: I came here to apologize, to tell Lena she has been right to be cautious and keep safe, and instead I surprised her with a boy. No, even worse--an Invalid. After all this time and despite all her warnings, Lena is the one who has caught the deliria; Lena is the one with the biggest secrets--shy Lena, who has never even liked to stand up in front of the class, has been sneaking around and breaking every rule we have been taught. The laughter comes in spasms. I laugh until my stomach aches and tears are streaming down my cheeks. I laugh until I can\u0027t even tell if I\u0027m laughing or whether I\u0027ve started crying again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will I remember about the summer when it is over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwin feelings of pleasure and pain: oppressive heat, the frigid bite of the ocean, so cold it lodges in your ribs and takes your breath away; eating ice cream so fast a headache rises from the teeth to the eyeballs; endless, boring evenings with the Hargroves, stuffing myself with food better than any I have ever eaten in my life; and sitting with Lena and Alex at 37 Brooks in the Highlands, watching a beautiful sunset bleed out into the sky, knowing that we are one day closer to our cures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena and Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have Lena back again, but she is changed, and it seems that every day she grows a little more different, a little more distant, as though I am watching her walk down a darkening hallway. Even when we are alone--which is rare now; Alex is almost always with us--there is a vagueness to her, as though she is floating through her life in the middle of a daydream. And when we are with Alex, I might as well not be there. They speak in a language of whispers and giggles and secrets; their words are like a fairy-tale tangle of thorns, which place a wall between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am happy for her. I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sometimes, just before going to sleep, when I am at my most vulnerable, I am jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else will I remember, if I remember anything at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time Fred Hargrove kisses my cheek, his lips are dry on my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRacing with Lena to the buoys at Back Cove; the way she smiled when she confessed she\u0027d done the same thing with Alex; and discovering when we got back to the beach that my soda had turned warm, syrupy, undrinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Angelica, post-cure, helping her mother clip roses in their front yard; the way she smiled and waved cheerfully, her eyes unfocused, as though they were fixated on some imaginary spot above my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot seeing Steve Hilt at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd rumors, persistent rumors: of Invalids, of resistance, of the growth of the disease, spreading its blackness among us. Every day, streets papered with more and more flyers. Reward, reward, reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReward for information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you see something, say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA paper town, a paper world: paper rustling in the wind, whispering to me, hissing out a message of poison and jealousy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you know something, do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry, Lena. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hana-delirium-1-5/page-8.html","bookId":1719,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:02 AM"}
