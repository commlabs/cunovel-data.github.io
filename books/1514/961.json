Bright and resplendent silver halos were emitted in a circular ripple. They resembled waves and looked exceptionally brilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZuo Fei’s body gradually faded away as he stood within the light circle. However, a ten feet large thunderbolt core slowly took shape as his body slowly faded away. Meanwhile, there was an extremely frightening fluctuation being vaguely emitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young friend, please accept my final gift. Haha, thanks for freeing me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZuo Fei’s fading figure smilingly looked at Lin Dong. His eyes were filled with gratitude and joy. He was aware that he would completely disappear from this world the moment his body disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder, rest in peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong respectfully bowed towards Zuo Fei, as someone from the younger generation ought to. Although he had only known Zuo Fei for an extremely short period of time, the carefree and suave fashion in which the latter faced death, was indeed worthy of his respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young friend, if you can obtain all the silver tower keys, you should be able to control the lightning realm. Hence, if you want to obtain the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol, you must obtain the complete set of keys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZuo Fei’s hoarse voice stealthily sounded out just as his body was about to completely vanish within the lightning glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded gently. He looked at Zuo Fei’s body as he vanished and felt a sense of loss. However, he quickly braced his attention. The dead have already left the world, however he was still alive and had to live on properly. That was because there were still things that he must protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to protect those things, he would require an even greater amount of power. The incident in the Unique Devil City allowed Lin Dong understand just how powerless he was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not wish for a similar incident to occur again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling of being hunted down like a homeless stray was truly terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong inhaled a deep breath of air and suppressed the fluctuating emotions within his heart. After which, he turned his attention towards the thunderbolt core filled with lightning glow, in front of him. The size of this thunderbolt core was at least over a dozen times larger compared to those that he had obtained before. Moreover, the lightning energy contained within was even purer and more potent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so powerful that it even Lin Dong’s expression to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is indeed worthy a thunderbolt core that was agglomerated by a Profound Death stage expert…” Lin Dong sighed. Zuo Fei’s body had been refined over thousands of years at the deepest part of the lightning lake. Every muscle and skin on his body had likely merged completely with the lighting energy. Now that his body had been completely reduced into a thunderbolt core, the strength of that thunderbolt was likely quite terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s first try and see how much I can absorb…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s eyes were searing hot as he stared at the thunderbolt core. He immediately sat down in mid-air. A thought passed through his mind before his Devouring Ancestral Symbol turned into a black hole above his head. After which, the black hole rotated slowly. Waves after waves of devouring force spluttered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low and deep thunder roar was emitted from within the thunderbolt core after having seemingly sensed the devourment of the devouring power. There seemed to be a vague resisting force being emitted. This thunderbolt core was clearly even more powerful compared to the rest and it was actually able to put up resistance, when it knew that it was about to be devoured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, its resistance clearly did not pose much problems for Lin Dong. The Devouring Ancestral Symbol increased its rotating speed. Following which, the rate in which the devouring power surged out also grew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuzz buzz!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thunderbolt core trembled intensely in the face of this increasingly powerful and overbearing Devouring Power. Soon after, many bright lightning glows turned into resplendent rays that escaped and flowed continuously towards the black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning sparks cackled within the black hole and there was thunder being vaguely emitted. However, these wild and violent Lighting Power were clearly helpless in the face of the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, which could devour everything in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black hole lingered over Lin Dong’s head. Suddenly, it paused. A lightning glow whistled out from it and directly wrapped around Lin Dong, who was sitting below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightning glow contained an extremely pure lightning energy. Moreover, this type of lightning energy had already tamed by the Devouring Power after passing through the Devouring Ancestral Symbol. Hence, it did not cause any discomfort to Lin Dong’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, Lin Dong was able to fearlessly absorb this type of pure lightning energy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile rose on the corner of Lin Dong’s mouth. He slowly shut his eyes while his hands formed a training seal. Green light surged on his body and he was just like a massive bottomless beast, that continuously absorbed the lightning energy into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s body trembled intensely after these majestic lightning energy entered his body. A low and deep thunder continued to be emitted from within his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, only Lin Dong was able to clearly feel that after an explosive thunder roar, waves of pure lightning energy were beginning to merge with his limbs, meridians and bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese pure lightning energy caused his body to feel vaguely numb. In the face of this numbness, the cells, bones, muscles within his body emitted a greedy cry. They could feel that after absorbing this power, they would grow increasingly powerful…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen light was spread across Lin Dong’s body. The Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill had also detected the benefits of the lightning energy and it actually began to circulate by itself. Green light surged and greedily absorbed all the lightning energy that surged onto his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the thunderbolt continuously being emitted from within his body, many green dragon light tattoos began to form at a shocking rate…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the Chaotic Tower, Lin Dong’s physical body had already reached a certain stage. However, it was clear that the current him was about to break this limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of thunder roars spread in a wave like fashion inside the Burning Sky Cauldron. Lin Dong quietly sat under the black hole. At this moment, the Devouring Ancestral Symbol and the thunderbolt core had clearly formed a half-cycle with Lin Dong. The Devouring Ancestral Symbol would devour and tame the energy within the thunderbolt core. After which, it would continuously pour it into Lin Dong’s body, allowing the meridians and bones within Lin Dong’s body to absorb it perfectly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green light over Lin Dong’s body grew denser at a shockingly fast pace under this continuously absorption. The green dragon light tattoo on his body also became increasingly resplendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it seems like regardless of how much Lin Dong absorbed, the size of the thunderbolt core in front of him remained the same and it only looked slightly dulller. From this, it was possible to tell just how frightening the lightning energy contained within it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thunderbolt roar continued to ricochiate within the interior of the Burning Sky Cauldron. Around half a day passed before the green light flickering over Lin Dong’s body slowly diminished. The black hole above his head also gradually stopped rotating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChi!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s tightly shut eyes were suddenly opened at a certain moment. Both his eyes were filled with lightning glow. A green light scattered, causing them to appear somewhat mysterious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breath of white vapour was slowly being spat out from Lin Dong’s mouth. Within that white vapour, tiny lightning arcs flashed. He extended both his palms and it was possible to see that there was even tiny electric currents running across his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA joy flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes. He quickly shut his eyes and sensed the situation within his body. The joy within his eyes abruptly grew richer when he next opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty-five!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Lin Dong discovered that the green dragon light tattoos within his body had actually reached thirty-five!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the Chaotic Tower, the maximum number of green dragon light tattoos that his physical body could form was ten. The other thirteen tattoos were a gift from having devoured the purple-gold skin. However, those could only be used once. Lin Dong had already used all of them when fighting Pang Hao previously. Now… Lin Dong realized that after only a few days of training, the number of green dragon light tattoos in his body had reached thirty-five!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis rate at which he was improving was almost god-like!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, Lin Dong was confident that if he was to directly use these thirty five green dragon light tattoo, it was likely that he could cripple Pang Hao with a single punch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is really good stuff!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong parted his mouth and laughed. His eyes looked at the thunderbolt core in front of him. At this moment, it had become slightly dimmer. However, it was still filled with a surging lightning energy. Clearly, it was still sufficient for his training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Lin Dong had predicted, the lightning energy contained within this thunderbolt core had surpassed all the other thunderbolt cores combined!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems like he did not lose out even though he was a good samaritan this time around!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Currently, I am in the middle of the cave. It is not apt to train here for long…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong waved his sleeve. He kept the thunderbolt core in front of him into the Qiankun Bag. Although he was aware that his strength would increase if he continued to train, he did not have so much time to do so now. The Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol was his main goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong ceased lingering any further the moment this thought crossed his mind. He disappeared from the Burning Sky Cauldron. After he disappeared, the thunder roar within the cauldron also stealthily vanished…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-958\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-960\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-959","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM"}
