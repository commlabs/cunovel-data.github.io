Six operators sat on each side of the board. In the middle of the board was a pneumatic chute. As the calls came in, the operators wrote a message, put it in the chute, and sent it upstairs to the dispatcher, for immediate relay to a substation or patrol car. The calls never ceased. They poured in day and night, like a river of tragedy flooding in from the citizens of the huge me tropolis. Men and women who were terrified...lonely...desperate...drunk...injured...homicidal...It was a scene from Hogarth, painted with vivid, an guished words instead of colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this Monday afternoon there was a feeling of added tension in the air. Each telephone operator handled his job with full concentration, and yet each was aware of the number of detectives and FBI agents who kept moving in and out of the room, receiving and giving orders, working efficiently and quietly as they spread a vast electronic net for Dr. Judd Stevens and Detective Frank Angeli. The atmosphere was quickened, strangely staccato, as though the action were being staged by some grim, nervous puppeteer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Bertelli was talking to Allen Sullivan, a member of the Mayor\u0027s Crime Commission, when McGreavy walked in. McGreavy had met Sullivan before. He was tough and honest. Bertelli broke off his conversation and turned to the detective, his face a question mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things are moving,\" McGreavy said. \"We found an eyewitness, a night watchman who works in the building across the street from Dr. Stevens\u0027 office building. On Wednesday night, when someone broke into Dr. Stevens\u0027 office, the watchman was just going on duty. He saw two men go into the building. The street door was locked and they opened it with a key. He figured they worked there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get an ID?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He identified a picture of Angeli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wednesday night Angeli was supposed to have been home in bed with the flu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the second man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The watchman didn\u0027t get a good look at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn operator plugged in one of the innumerable red lights blinking across the switchboard and turned to Captain Ber telli. \"For you, Captain. New Jersey Highway Patrol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBertelli snatched up an extension phone. \"Captain Bertelli.\" He listened a moment. \"Are you sure?...Good! Will you get every unit you can in there? Set up roadblocks. I want that area covered like a blanket. Keep in close touch... Thanks.\" He hung up and turned to the two men. \"It looks like we got a break. A rookie patrolman in New Jersey spotted Angeli\u0027s car on a secondary road near Orangeburg. The Highway Patrol\u0027s combing the area now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Stevens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in the car with Angeli. Alive. Don\u0027t worry. They\u0027ll find them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGreavy pulled out two cigars. He offered one to Sullivan, who refused it, handed one to Bertelli, and put the other one between his teeth. \"We\u0027ve got one thing going for us. Dr. Stevens leads a charmed life.\" He struck a match and lit the two cigars. \"I just talked to a friend of his - -Dr. Peter Hadley. Dr. Hadley told me that he went to pick up Stevens in his office a few days ago and found Angeli there with a gun in his hand. Angeli told some cock-and-bull story about expecting a burglar. My guess is that Dr. Hadley\u0027s arrival saved Stevens\u0027 life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you first get on to Angeli?\" Sullivan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It started with a couple of tips that he was shaking down some merchants,\" McGreavy said. \"When I went to check them out, the victims wouldn\u0027t talk. They were scared, but I couldn\u0027t figure out why. I didn\u0027t say anything to Angeli. I just started keeping a close watch on him. When the Hanson murder broke, Angeli came and asked if he could work on the case with me. He gave me some bullshit about how much he admired me and how he had always wanted to be my partner. I knew he had to have an angle, so with Captain Bertelli\u0027s permission, I played along with him. No wonder he wanted to work on the case - he was in it up to his ass! At that time I wasn\u0027t sure whether Dr. Stevens was involved in the murders of Hanson and Carol Roberts, but I decided to use him to help set up Angeli. I built up a phony case against Stevens and told Angeli I was going to nail the doctor for the murders. I figured that if Angeli thought he was off the hook, he\u0027d relax and get careless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Angeli surprised the hell out of me by putting up a fight to keep Stevens out of jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan looked up, puzzled. \"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he was trying to knock him off and he couldn\u0027t get to him if he were locked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When McGreavy began to put the pressure on,\" Captain Bertelli said, \"Angeli came to me hinting that McGreavy was trying to frame Dr. Stevens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were sure then that we were on the right track,\" McGreavy said. \"Stevens hired a private detective named Norman Moody. I checked Moody out and learned that he had tangled with Angeli before when a client of Moody\u0027s was picked up by Angeli on a drug rap. Moody said his client was framed. Knowing what I know now, I\u0027d say Moody was telling the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Moody lucked into the answer from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t all luck. Moody was bright. He knew Angeli was probably involved. When he found the bomb in Dr. Stevens\u0027 car, he turned it over to the FBI and asked them to check it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was afraid if Angeli got hold of it, he\u0027d find a way to get rid of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my guess. But someone slipped up and a copy of the report was sent to Angeli. He knew then that Moody was on to him. The first real break we got was when Moody came up with the name \u0027Don Vinton.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cosa Nostra for \u0027The Big Man.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. For some reason, someone in La Cosa Nostra was out to get Dr. Stevens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you tie up Angeli with La Cosa Nostra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went back to the merchants Angeli had been putting the squeeze on. When I mentioned La Cosa Nostra, they panicked. Angeli was working for one of the Cosa Nostra families, but he got greedy and was doing a little shakedown business of his own on the side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would La Cosa Nostra want to kill Dr. Stevens?\" Sullivan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. We\u0027re working on several angles.\" He sighed wearily. \"We got two lousy breaks. Angeli slipped the men we had tailing him, and Dr. Stevens ran away from the hospital before I could warn him about Angeli and give him protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe switchboard flashed. An operator plugged in the call and listened a moment. \"Captain Bertelli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBertelli grabbed the extension phone. \"Captain Bertelli.\" He listened, saying nothing, then slowly replaced the receiver and turned to McGreavy. \"They lost them.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-naked-face/page-21.html","bookId":2354,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:51 AM"}
