He fumbled with the grocery bag he was carrying, almost dropping it in shock at the sound of the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe One would occasionally surprise him by suddenly appearing in his office or apartment. But this was not the One\u0027s voice. Ernst almost wished it were. It would mean ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An old acquaintance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst felt for the wall switch, found and flipped it. The light revealed a nondescript man in his midthirties relaxing in a chair on the far side of the room. He looked like someone off the street: jeans, baseball cap, sweatshirt. He was clean shaven, with brown hair, brown eyes ... and was that one of Ernst\u0027s Grolsch lagers in his hand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about his face ignited a spark of familiarity, but not bright enough for recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look familiar...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember your little sojourn at the Lodge in Johnson, New Jersey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it all came crashing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded. \"Your former groundskeeper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControlling his initial shock, Ernst walked across his front room and set the bag on the counter. As the answers to a number of long-running questions began to flash through his mind, he realized he might be in mortal danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMight be. Jack certainly had changed from the skinny teenager Ernst had known. He\u0027d filled out but remained wiry instead of bulky. He didn\u0027t look the least bit threatening. In fact, he appeared perfectly innocuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if what Ernst suspected were true, he was anything but. Hard to believe, looking at him now, but no one knew better than Ernst how appearances could deceive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk ... get him talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how did you reach the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst clenched his jaw. The building was supposed to have excellent security. He\u0027d have to have a talk with the management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have armed guards from the Order who routinely...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was shaking his head. \"No, you don\u0027t. Weeks ago I followed you from the Lodge and I\u0027ve been watching this place on and off since. You don\u0027t have any extra security. And why should you? No one outside the Order knows who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue. He had no enemies. Except perhaps the man seated before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay cool and keep him talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rather ironic, don\u0027t you think, that while you\u0027ve been stalking me, I\u0027ve been looking for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assumed that,\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I so predictable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you learned that Weezy Myers was Weezy Connell of Johnson, En-Jay, and her brother Eddie was a member of the Order, I figured it wouldn\u0027t take you long to start wondering what had happened to the third musketeer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it was idle at first. Then I learned that you had seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still on Earth, just off the radar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now you\u0027re here. Any particular reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On how the conversation goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had just enough of an ominous ring to bunch the muscles at the back of Ernst\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will we be a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst didn\u0027t ask again on what. Instead he pointed to the green bottle in Jack\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could use one of those. Shall I get you another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I\u0027ll come with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized it had been too much to hope for Jack to leave him alone in the kitchen, but it had been worth a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to put some food away as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months ago he\u0027d found a wonderful German butcher, a man who made superb bratwurst. Brats had always been a comfort food for him, but over the years he had avoided too many of them for health reasons. After yesterday he didn\u0027t see much point in worrying about his health, and he was in desperate need of comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack hovered as he placed the perishables in the refrigerator, and Ernst thought about that term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerishable ... we\u0027re all perishable, but am I about to perish?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed a pair of bottles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hope you don\u0027t mind that I helped myself,\" Jack said. \"Not too many people stock Grolsch. Hard to resist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep him talking ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the Dutch make excellent lagers, but not quite up to my favorite - Marzen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found an opener and popped the caps. He handed a bottle to Jack and grabbed a Pilsner glass for himself - he didn\u0027t drink from bottles. They returned to the front room where Ernst made a show of searching for coasters. He knew exactly where they were but opened two wrong drawers first. He pulled a Taser from the second and palmed it, thumbing the ON switch before quickly slipping it into his suit coat pocket as he pretended to discover the coasters in the third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he felt a little safer. He had no idea how this might turn out, but at least he could protect himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed Jack a coaster and they settled into upholstered chairs, facing across a glass-top table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I may ask,\" he said, keeping his tone light, \"how did you, as you phrase it, drop off the radar so completely? After a cursory search found no trace of you, I put some very skilled people to work looking for you. They came up with nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I was never on the radar. Never bothered applying for a Social Security number, always worked for cash.\" A quick smile. \"You always paid me cash, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst nodded. He remembered. Petty cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A long time ago.\" Half a lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were you so intent on finding me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a blank space that needed filling in. A mystery man. Brother Connell said you were a repairman, but I began to wonder if you might be related to another mystery man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? And who might that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he phrase this? Should he choose his words carefully? Why? Jack\u0027s appearance here pretty much confirmed his suspicions, although he still found it hard to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMight as well simply come out and say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone involved with the Connells was using deadly force against the Order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a trace of surprise in Jack\u0027s eyes as he said, \"Now why would anyone do that? I mean, considering the caliber of people you sent against them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst felt his saliva began to evaporate. Jack had just admitted to being that man. One thing to suspect, but to have it confirmed in such a matter-of-fact tone ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skinny, innocent kid who had mowed the Lodge\u0027s lawn had grown into a cold-blooded killer. Granted, he had been facing equally cold-blooded killers, but he had proved just as ruthless and much more efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst was trapped here with a very, very dangerous man. Was he armed? Of course he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep him talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced calm and shook his head. No need to fake bafflement. \"How did that boy pulling the lawn mower behind his bike wind up...?\" He shook his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Necessity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a hand. \"I didn\u0027t come here to tell my life story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a question, and you\u0027ve got the answer. At least I\u0027m assuming you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly \"a\" question? That was a relief. But what would happen if he couldn\u0027t answer it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem awfully sure of that. Let\u0027s see if you\u0027re right. Go ahead: Ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack spoke and the question seemed to hover in the air between them. Clear, succinct, to the point. He could almost see the words floating before him, but he couldn\u0027t quite grasp their meaning. It sounded as if he\u0027d said ... but no ... he couldn\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I go about finding the One?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst\u0027s muscles seized, freezing him in place. His first impression had been correct. He\u0027d truly asked about the One. But ... impossible. He couldn\u0027t know about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Ernst flashed back on a conversation with the One, perhaps a month ago. He had appeared in Ernst\u0027s office and asked what he knew about the Order\u0027s Lodge in Johnson, New Jersey. He\u0027d made Ernst recount his stay there in excruciating detail. Ernst hadn\u0027t perceived it at the time, but in light of what was transpiring at this moment, it occurred to him that the One had seemed especially interested in the young groundskeeper and his girlfriend who had invaded the Lodge one night with near disastrous consequences. Ernst had thought he was interested in the event, but now it was clear he\u0027d been interested in Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unexpected symmetry: the One asking about Jack, and now Jack asking about the One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one?\" Ernst fought to maintain a neutral, mildly curious expression as he took a sip of his beer. He noticed the glass shaking in his hand. \"The one what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked annoyed and the mild brown eyes hardened. \"No games. I asked you a straight question. I expect a straight answer. You know exactly who I\u0027m talking about: the One ... the point man for the Otherness ... Rasalom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst choked and spewed beer across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t speak his name!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a bigger shock than hearing the name said aloud was the realization that Jack knew it. Only the High Council of Seven and precious few others were privileged with the One\u0027s name. Even Ernst wasn\u0027t supposed to know it, but he\u0027d heard it from his father shortly before he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack merely stared at him, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst stared back as other connections formed. Jack knew something only a few in the Order were aware of. So had another man ... the bearded man who\u0027d accosted him in Central Park. He\u0027d known about the One and the Fhinntmanchca. He\u0027d pressed a good Austrian pistol under his chin and asked him questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Tasered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the feel of the current jolting through him, running from the back of his neck down his spine and limbs, coursing through his chest. Pain and helplessness - his useless muscles felt as if they\u0027d melted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe imagined a beard on Jack and - yes ... no question. Ernst had never seen the adult Jack, so he hadn\u0027t recognized him through the beard. No doubt about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a burst of anger he slid his hand toward the pocket where his own Taser hid. He\u0027d bought it after the incident, hoping someday he\u0027d have a chance to return the favor when he caught up to the mystery man. His fingers brushed against the comforting lump, then withdrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too far away. He\u0027d bide his time till Jack was closer. Then ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last summer,\" Ernst said. \"In the park. That was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded. \"I was in a rush chasing that Fhinn-thing, and neglected to introduce myself. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man I was with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hank Thompson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo surprise there. If he knew the One\u0027s taken name, he probably knew as much about Thompson as Ernst did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He didn\u0027t see you but is under the impression that you\u0027ve met before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded. \"We have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do get around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not by choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst wasn\u0027t sure what that meant, but didn\u0027t want to waste time pursuing it when he had another question burning to be asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about the One? How do you know his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve met - a couple of times, in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words struck like a blow. \"Met? I don\u0027t believe you. How could you have met the One? And if you really know him, why do you need me to find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not on the best of terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it became clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re aligned with the Enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the reason for the One\u0027s interest in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack frowned. \"\u0027Enemy\u0027?\" Then nodded. \"Oh, right. From your end, I work for the Enemy. From mine, you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst remembered secretly testing him for the Taint as a teen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does someone so rich with the Taint come to oppose the Otherness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"Only the Ally can answer that. But you tell me: How does anyone with half a brain - and you\u0027ve always struck me as an intelligent man - come to work for a force that is out to put some serious hurt on humanity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the Otherness is going to win. I have no doubts about that and neither should you. Those who help it win will not, as you put it, have the hurt put on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack gave him a lopsided grin. \"You really believe that? You really think you can trust something like the Otherness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As much as you trust your so-called Ally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered across Jack\u0027s features. Pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust the so-called Ally. Not a bit. It keeps the Otherness at bay. That\u0027s all it\u0027s good for. And not for our sake. It has its own agenda. I learned that the hard way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting. The Enemy - Jack\u0027s Ally - was reputed to be as ruthless as the Otherness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, Jack said, \"You don\u0027t strike me as a man with many illusions, so why do you think you\u0027ll be spared if the Change comes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it comes,\" Ernst said, \"the One will ascend to power, and those who aided him will ascend with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You and your buddies in the Order will be seated at the right hand of God.\" Jack laughed. \"At the risk of sounding like John McEnroe, you cannot be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The multimillennial existence of the Septimus Order has been devoted to that. Our lore confirms it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again. \"And you\u0027re basing this on what - the word of a guy who feeds on pain and misery? Not exactly what I\u0027d call an ironclad guarantee. After the Change he won\u0027t need you or your Order anymore, Drexler. He\u0027ll be top dog and all bets will be off. New rules will be in place and he\u0027ll be the one making them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words cut to the heart of Ernst\u0027s own misgivings. He\u0027d taken it as a matter of course that if the Change occurred during his lifetime he would be part of it. But would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack wouldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of leverage will you have, Drexler? Do you even have a promise? Did he ever say to you, \u0027When I take over, you\u0027ll be one of my lieutenants\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take that as a no. But think about it: Even if he did promise, you\u0027d have only moral leverage, and we know what kind of moral code this creep lives by. We\u0027re talking about the guy who convinced Vlad that impaling people was an entertaining hobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s quite enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Face it, Drexler: If the One gets his way, you\u0027ll be as screwed as the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst felt something snap within him. With a cry he leaped across the room, pulling the Taser from his pocket as he moved. When Jack raised an arm to ward him off, Ernst rammed the prongs of the Taser against it and pressed the button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed it again with the same result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill seated in his chair, Jack stared up at him, his smile almost sad as he shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst felt a pressure against his throat and angled his gaze downward. He realized with a start that the pressure originated from the muzzle of that same Austrian pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had that come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it and get back to your seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst did just that, and watched as Jack rested the Glock on his lap and took a sip of his beer. He shifted his gaze to the Taser on the floor. What had gone wrong? It had been turned on, had had plenty of time to build a charge ... It should have reduced Jack to twitching helplessness. What sort of man was this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked at him. \"Hit a nerve, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is happening to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the icy control that had been his lifelong pride? His father would be ashamed of him for letting someone - his former teenage groundskeeper, of all people - goad him like that. And it was clear to him now that Jack had been doing just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that what this visit was about? To demonstrate that Ernst was not in control - not of who entered his home, not of his own emotions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat question again. Was this his true reason for coming?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The One? I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stared at him. Ernst tried to read his face. What next? Torture. Ernst didn\u0027t see Jack as a torturer, but he was rich with the Taint, and someone with so much of the Otherness in him might be capable of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" he added. \"The One answers to no one and has never felt the need or obligation to keep the Order informed of his whereabouts. Communication with the One is, fittingly, a one-way street. When he wants something from us, he contacts us. We do not contact him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack kept staring in silence. He was beginning to make Ernst uncomfortable. Finally he broke it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was your last contact with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After your Jihad virus failed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he know that? Did he have a contact inside the Order? Oh, yes. Edward Connell. It must have been him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst saw no use in playing coy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that when he put out the hit on the Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst stiffened and tried to hide it. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack frowned. \"You hesitated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, he didn\u0027t know when the One had ordered the attack. Szeto never mentioned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst dodged that. \"May I inquire as to why you wish to know his whereabouts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst barked a laugh. He couldn\u0027t help it. He waved a hand. \"I apologize. Kill the One? Your hubris borders on the surreal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack seemed unperturbed. \"You think he\u0027s invulnerable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no. But he\u0027s so much older and wiser than you. If you know his taken name, then I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware that he\u0027s survived countless attacks over the thousands of years of his life, many of them launched by one of equal longevity who is far more capable than you. And yet he is still standing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So is the one who made those attacks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes. The so-called Defender or Guardian or Paladin or whatever he\u0027s called these days. But where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack rose from his seat. \"That was my question to you: Where is the One?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you: I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack closed the distance between them and stood over him, reaching into the pocket of his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what? Ernst wondered. A knife? A bullet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo ... something small and metallic in his hand. Ernst flinched as it landed in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your little gizmo will work better with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst glanced down and saw the Taser\u0027s battery, then looked at Jack\u0027s retreating form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned at the door and pulled the hood of his sweatshirt up over his baseball cap. \"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Ernst didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say you don\u0027t know where he is or how to find him, and I believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was baffled. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because if you knew, you\u0027d tell me. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hadn\u0027t occurred to Ernst until this moment, but if he did indeed know the whereabouts of the One ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ... yes, I believe I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you think I don\u0027t stand a chance against him, and you\u0027d like to see me get my just deserts for thinking I can take him on. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\" This was uncanny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged as he opened the door. \"So there\u0027s no point in continuing this conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind him, leaving Ernst alone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-21.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
