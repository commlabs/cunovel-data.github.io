This opened sufficiently to form a little harbour for half-a-dozen fishing luggers, the rocks running out sufficiently to act as a breakwater and keep off the huge billows which at times came rolling in from the south-west, so that on one side of the cliffs lay piled up a slope of wave-washed and rounded boulders, many as big as great Cheshire cheeses, while on the other, where the luggers lay, there were pebbles and sand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upon this rail four men were leaning with folded arms, apparently doing nothing but stare out at the bright, clear sea; but every eye was keenly on the look-out for one of those dark-cloud, shadow-like appearances on the surface which to them meant money and provisions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But there was no sign of fish breaking the surface of the water, and as Lance approached he had a good view of four immense pairs of very thick flannel trousers, whose bottoms were tucked into as many huge boots, which, instead of being drawn well up their owners\u0027 thighs, hung in folds about their ankles, and glittered in the sunshine, where they were well specked with bright fish scales.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Higher up Lance looked upon four pairs of very short braces, hitched over big bone buttons, and holding the aforesaid trousers close up under their wearers\u0027 armpits. The rest of the costume consisted of caps, home-made, and of fur formerly worn by unfortunate seals which had come too near a boat instead of seeking safety in one of the wave-washed caves round the point.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hi!

It was only Hezz, or more commonly \"Hezzerer,\" in three syllables, and he had been busy at work putting a patch on the bottom of a clumsy upturned boat which, as he put it, \"lived in the cave,\" and he was now daubing his new patch with hot tar from a little three-legged iron kettle held in his left hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But this does not account for the groans and squeaks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These were produced from the youth\u0027s throat. In fact, Hezz was singing over his work, though it did not sound very musical at the time, for something was broken; but it was only Hezz\u0027s voice, and it was only the previous night that Old Poltree, his father, had said to Billy Poltree, another of the big fisherman\u0027s offspring, \"Yo\u0027 never know wheer to have him now, my son: one minute he\u0027s hoarse as squire\u0027s Devon bull, and next he\u0027s letting go like the pig at feeding time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the sound of the dull thuds made by Lance\u0027s feet in the sand, Hezz Poltree whisked himself round and held his tar-kettle and brush out like a pair of balances to make him turn, and showed a good-looking young mahogany face—that is to say, it was paler than his father\u0027s, and not so ruddy and polished.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hullo, Master—Lance,\" he said, widening his mouth and showing his white teeth, joining in the laughter as the visitor threw himself down on the sand and roared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Whisked himself round and held his tar-kettle and brush out like a pair of balances.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t help it, Master—Lance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Try again,\" cried the new-comer, wiping the tears from his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do try,\" growled the boy, beginning once more in a deep bass, and then ending in a treble squeak. \"There\u0027s somethin\u0027 got loose in my voice. \u0027Tarn\u0027t my fault.
