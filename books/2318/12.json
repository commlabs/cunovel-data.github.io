Evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t shoot him,” she was saying. “It was a lousy idea anyway. Killed in a robbery—who the hell robs a butcher shop? You know how much dough he takes in during a day? Next to nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got a better way, Vicki?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said. “A much better way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was pulling Jay back, leading him away from the door. And then she was kicking the wooden wedge aside, and laughing, and shutting the door. He heard her laughter, and he heard the terribly final sound the door made when it clicked shut, and then he did not hear anything at all. They were leaving the shop, undoubtedly making all sorts of sounds. The cold bin was soundproof. He heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep, deep breath, and the pain in his chest knocked him to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should have waited, he thought. One more minute, Vicki, and I could have done it myself. Your hands would be clean, Vicki. I could have died happy, Vicki. I could have died not knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a bitch, Vicki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lie down, he told himself. Now go to sleep, just the way you planned it yourself. Nothing’s different. And you can’t get out, because you planned it this way. You’re through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouble indemnity. The bitch was going to collect double indemnity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he thought. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him fifteen minutes to think of it. He had to find a way, and it wasn’t easy. If they thought about murder they would have her, of course. She’d left prints all over the cold-bin door. But they would not be looking for prints, not the way things stood. They’d call it an accident and that would be that. Which was the trouble with setting things up so perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could make it look like suicide. That might cheat her out of the insurance. He could slash his wrists or something, or—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could cheat her out of more than the insurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took awhile, but he worked it out neatly. First he scooped up his cigarette butt and stuck it in his pants pocket. Then he scattered the ashes around. Step one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext he walked to the rear of the cold bin and took a meat cleaver from the peg on the wall. He set the cleaver on top of a hanging side of beef, gave the meat a push. The cleaver toppled over and plummeted to the floor. It landed on the handle and bounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried again with another slab of meat. He tried time after time, until he found the piece that was just the right distance from the floor and found just the spot to set the cleaver. When he nudged the meat, the cleaver came down, turned over once, and landed blade-down in the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried it four times to make sure it would work. It never missed. Then he picked the cleaver from the floor, wiped his prints from the blade and handle with his apron, and placed the cleaver in position on top of the hunk of meat. It was a leg of lamb, the meat blood-red, the fat sickly white. He sat down on the floor, then stretched out on his back looking up at the leg of lamb. Good meat, he thought. Prime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, tensed with pain from his chest and stomach, relaxed and smiled again. Not quite like going to sleep this way, he thought. Not painless, like freezing. But faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a leg, touched his foot to the leg of lamb. He gave it a gentle little push, and the cleaver sliced through the air and found his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHATE GOES COURTING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI SHOULD HAVE FIGURED IT the second day. By that time you have to see it unless you shut your eyes, and if you shut your eyes you just about deserve what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wind. It’s that wind you get out on a plain or desert and almost nowhere else, the kind of wind that builds up miles away and comes at you and keeps on going right through you and on into the next county. Clothes don’t help. If you’re in the desert the sand goes right through your clothes, and if you put a wet handkerchief over your face the wind blows the sand right through the handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re up north you freeze. The wind ices you right through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when you’re in Kansas there’s just the wind coming at you like a sword through a piece of silk, just the wind and nothing else. It’s a sweeping wind, not the twister that blew Dorothy to Oz and knocks over a house now and then. The sky clouds up and the sun disappears and the damned wind is all over the place. Then it rains water by the pound and when it clears up the air is still and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s how it usually happens, and that’s why I couldn’t have figured it out on the first day, not even with my eyes wide open. But the second day I should have known. On the second day there was still no rain, no storm at all, and the wind was blowing all over and harder than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happens that way once in a while. It happens, with the wind holding up forever like it’s never going to stop, and in Kansas they call it the bad wind. It blows forever, and it blows your tendons so tight you think they’re going to snap on you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd something happens. Something like a man dying or a house burning, something bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s why I should have known—if I had my eyes open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe afternoon of the second day we were out hunting jacks in the north field. The wind was coming from the west, bending the long grasses all the way over and holding them there. We were hunting into the wind; it didn’t make too much sense that way, but it was late and we were headed back home, and back home meant walking into the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bet she’s been here,” Brad was saying. “Not hunting—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady let out a burst of good baying, sounding the way a good beagle sounds, and she cut off the rest of his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hear me, John?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded at him but he wasn’t looking at me. He was about twenty yards ahead of me and it was no use talking into the wind. It just shoves the words right back into your mouth. You can shout at it, but I didn’t much feel like shouting. I didn’t feel like answering, when you come right down to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hear me? She’s been out here plenty of times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cap was down over my ears but I could still hear him good and clear. We could have gone home right then. The bag was full of jacks, nice husky ones that Lady ran down like a champion, more rabbit than we could eat in the next year and a half. But going home wouldn’t do any good. Brad was a tough guy to shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice soft grass out here. Her nice little body would fit real cozy in it, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the grass without meaning to and my head started to ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Know what we used to call a woman like that? Called them ‘sweethearts of the fleet.’ There’s lots like her, Brother John. She’s not the only little tramp in the—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“World. But you wouldn’t know, would you? Old John stays on the farm through thick and thin. Doesn’t let the glitter of the outside world knock his life apart. Sober Old John. You ever fixing to see the world, brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. I hear you went to Omaha once. Like it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was all right.” I didn’t want to answer him. I never wanted to answer him, but that didn’t make much difference. It was always like that—him needling and pushing and prodding and me taking it and answering when I was supposed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was in the Navy it was nice. Pa and I made the farm run, coming out ahead in a good year and squeezing by in a bad one. Hunting with Lady and catching a movie in town now and then, and a long sleep at night and good food and plenty of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with Brad around you don’t sleep much. Ma died giving birth to him, and he’s been killing the rest of us since then. Brad was a smart little brother, a real sharp little fellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad and I never got along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You like Omaha, huh? That’s good—glad to hear it. But how does it stack up next to all the other big towns?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I didn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you really do the town or just go to the feed store? I hear they have a real fine feed store in Omaha. Lots of feed and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said something that I didn’t catch, and then he said a little louder, “How does Margie stack up next to the Omaha chippies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to kill him. If he were right close instead of twenty yards off, I would have hit him. I could feel the bag slipping off my shoulder and my fist balling up and sinking into that soft belly of his. My fist would have gone through him like the wind was going through me right then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have raised the gun and shot his head off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I clenched one fist and let it relax. I didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’d make a good one,” he said. “It’s her trade, all right. She’s got the shape for it. And plenty long years of experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it, Brad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All she’d have to do,” he went on, “is what they call relinquishing her amateur standing. Just sell it instead of giving it away. But maybe she likes it too much to set a price on it. Is it as good as I hear it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never touched her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was out of me before I could stop it. It was part question even though I knew he hadn’t. I had to make sure and I had to tell myself, and at the same time I didn’t want to know if he had. It didn’t matter. It didn’t make any difference at all, but I just didn’t want to hear about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure about that, Brother John? Well, maybe yes and maybe no. But I guess I’m fixing to try her, all right. If she’s as good as everybody says, I must be missing a hell of a lot. Is she that good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and listened to the wind. His voice seemed to come over the wind, cutting and burning just like that wind, just as bad and holding up just as long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or are you waiting until you’re married? Is that it, Brother John? That’s a good one—waiting it out on the town tramp!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to laugh. His laugh was like the wind, ice cold and mean as a mad dog, cutting like a sword through a piece of silk. I gave a whistle for Lady and she came like she always did and I headed back toward home, walking away and leaving him laughing that laugh of his in the middle of the fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later I was still walking and I could still hear him laughing and the wind was as bad as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody understood the whole thing, but no one else got on my back the way Brad did. Everybody knew about Margie, but everybody else kept to their own business and let me mind my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for Brad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others knew about Margie, but they also knew that Margie was different, that she wasn’t like any other woman who ever lived. It was something they could feel even if they didn’t know just why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beautiful. That was something all of them could see. It wasn’t exactly hard to see; it jumped out at you until all you were conscious of was the beauty of her. Her hair was the color of corn and she wore it long, letting it flow down pure and golden and glowing. Her body was so smooth and rounded that she seemed to be made out of liquid. She looked like she was moving even when she was standing absolutely still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she slept, she looked like a big cat crouched and ready to spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin was clear as a cameo. Her mouth was tiny and red and her eyes were a soft brown and her ears were little shells covered with a furry fuzz. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-12.html","bookId":2318,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM"}
