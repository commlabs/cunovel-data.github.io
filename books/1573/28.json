All her life, Tally had been troubled by insomnia, lying awake most nights thinking about arguments she\u0027d had, or wanted to have, or things she should have done differently. But here in the Smoke her mind shut off the moment her head hit the pillow, which wasn\u0027t even a pillow, just her new sweater stuffed into a cotton bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally still didn\u0027t know how long she was going to stay there. She hadn\u0027t come to a decision about whether to activate the pendant, but she knew that thinking about it all the time would drive her crazy. So she decided to put it out of her mind. One day she might wake up and realize that she couldn\u0027t stand to live her entire life as an ugly, no matter who it hurt or what it cost...but for the moment, Dr. Cable could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting her troubles was easy in the Smoke. Life was much more intense than in the city. She bathed in a river so cold that she had to jump in screaming, and she ate food pulled from the fire hot enough to burn her tongue, which city food never did. Of course, she missed shampoo that didn\u0027t sting her eyes, and flush toilets (she\u0027d learned to her horror what \"latrines\" were), and mostly medspray. But however blistered her hands became, Tally felt stronger than ever before. She could work all day at the railroad site, then race David and Shay home on hoverboards, her backpack full of more scrap metal than she could have lifted a month before. She learned from David how to repair her clothes with a needle and thread, how to tell raptors from their prey, and even how to clean fish, which turned out to be not nearly as bad as cutting them up in bio class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe physical beauty of the Smoke also cleared her mind of worries. Every day seemed to change the mountain, the sky, and the surrounding valleys, making them spectacular in a completely new way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNature, at least, didn\u0027t need an operation to be beautiful. It just was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning on the way to the railroad track, David pulled his board up alongside Tally\u0027s. He rode silently for a while, taking the familiar turns with his usual grace. Over the last two weeks, she\u0027d learned that his jacket was actually made of leather, real dead animals, but she\u0027d gradually gotten used to the idea. The Smokies hunted, but they were like the rangers, killing only species that didn\u0027t belong in this part of the world or that had gotten out of control thanks to the Rusties\u0027 meddling. With its random patches, the jacket would probably look silly on anyone else. But it suited David, somehow, as if growing up here in the wild allowed him to fuse with the animals that had donated their skins to his clothes. And it probably didn\u0027t hurt that he had actually made the jacket himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke up suddenly. \"I\u0027ve got a present for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A present? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, Tally understood that nothing in the Smoke ever lost its value. Nothing was discarded or given away just because it was old or broken. Everything was repaired, refitted, and recycled, and if one Smokey couldn\u0027t put it to use, it was traded to another. Few things were given away lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, really.\" David angled closer and handed her a small bundle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unwrapped it, following the familiar route down the stream almost without looking. It was a pair of gloves, handmade in light brown leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved the bright, city-made wrapping paper into her pocket, then pulled the gloves onto her blistered hands. \"Thanks! They fit perfectly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I made them when I was about your age. They\u0027re a little small for me these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally smiled, wishing she could hug him. When they spread their arms to take a hard turn, she held his hand for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlexing her fingers, Tally found that the gloves were soft and pliant, the palms worn pale from years of use. White lines across the finger joints revealed how they had fitted David\u0027s hands. \"They\u0027re wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" David said. \"It\u0027s not like they\u0027re magic or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but they\u0027ve got...something.\" History, Tally realized. In the city, she\u0027d owned lots of things - practically anything she wanted came out of the wall. But city things were disposable and replaceable, as interchangeable as the T-shirt, jacket, and skirt combinations of dorm uniforms. Here, in the Smoke, objects grew old, carrying their histories with them in dings and scratches and tatters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid chuckled at her and sped up, joining Shay at the front of the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they got to the railroad site, David announced that they had to clear more track, using vibrasaws to cut through the vegetation that had grown up around the metal rails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the trees?\" Croy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have to chop them down?\" Tally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shrugged. \"Scrub trees like this aren\u0027t good for much. But we won\u0027t waste them. We\u0027ll take them back to the Smoke for burning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burning?\" Tally said. The Smokies usually only cut down trees from the valley, not the rest of the mountain. These trees had been growing there for decades, and David wanted to use them just to cook a meal? She looked at Shay for support, but her friend\u0027s expression was carefully neutral. She probably agreed, but didn\u0027t want to argue with David in front of everyone about how to run his project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, burning,\" he said. \"And after we\u0027ve salvaged the track, we\u0027ll replant. Put a row of useful trees where the railroad used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five others looked at him silently. He spun a saw in his hand, anxious to get started, but aware he didn\u0027t have their full support yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, David,\" Croy said. \"These trees aren\u0027t useless. They protect the underbrush from sunlight, which keeps the soil from eroding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you win. Instead of planting some other kind of tree, we\u0027ll let the forest take back the land. All the crappy scrub and underbrush you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But do we have to clear-cut them?\" Astrix asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took a slow breath. \"Clear-cutting\" was the word for what the Rusties had done to the old forests: felling every tree, killing every living thing, turning entire countries into grazing land. Whole rain forests had been consumed, reduced from millions of interlocking species to a bunch of cows eating grass, a vast web of life traded for cheap hamburgers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, we\u0027re not clear-cutting. All we\u0027re doing is pulling out the garbage that the Rusties left behind,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said. \"It just takes a little surgery to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could chop around the trees,\" Tally said. \"Only cut into them where we need to. Like you said: surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine.\" He chuckled. \"Let\u0027s see what you think of these trees after you\u0027ve had to hack a few out of the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vibrasaw purred through heavy vines, parted tangled underbrush like a comb through wet hair, and sliced cleanly through metal when the odd misstroke brought the cutting edge down onto the track. But when its teeth met the gnarled roots and twisted branches of the scrub trees, it was a different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally grimaced as her saw bounced across the hard wood again, spitting bits of bark at her face, its low hum transformed into a protesting howl. She struggled to force the edge down into the tough old branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more cut and this section of track would be clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going good. You almost got it, Tally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed that Croy stood well back, poised to jump if the saw somehow slipped from her hands. She could see now why David had wanted to chop the scrub trees into pieces. It would have been a lot easier than reaching through the tangle of roots and branches, trying to bring the vibrasaw to bear against a precise spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid trees,\" Tally muttered, gritting her teeth as she plunged the blade down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the saw found purchase in the wood, letting out a high-pitched scream as it bit into the branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it slipped through, free for a second before it thrust, spitting and screeching, into the dirt below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\" Tally stepped back, lifting her goggles, the saw powering down in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroy stepped forward and kicked the section of branch away from the track. \"Perfect surgical slice, Doctor,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m getting the hang of this,\" Tally said, wiping her brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost noon, and the sun was beating down into the clearing mercilessly. She pulled off her sweater, realizing that the morning chill was long gone. \"You were right about the trees giving shade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it,\" Croy said. \"Nice sweater, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. Along with her new gloves, it was her prized possession. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did it cost you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six SpagBols.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little pricey. Pretty, though.\" Croy caught her eye. \"Tally, remember that first day you got here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I kind of grabbed your knapsack? I really wouldn\u0027t have taken your stuff. Not without giving you something for it. You just surprised me when you said I could have everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, no problem,\" she said. Now that she\u0027d worked with Croy, he seemed like a nice enough guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d rather have been teamed up with David or Shay, but those two were cutting together today. And it was probably time she got to know some of the other Smokies better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you got a new sleeping bag, too, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Twelve SpagBols.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be almost out of trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Only eight left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad. Still, I bet you didn\u0027t realize on your way here that you were eating your future wealth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally laughed. They crouched under the partly cut tree, pulling handfuls of cut vines from around the track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d known how valuable food packets were, I probably wouldn\u0027t have eaten so many, starving or not. I don\u0027t even like it anymore. The worst was SpagBol for breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good to me.\" Croy chuckled. \"This section look clear to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Let\u0027s start on the next one.\" She handed him the saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroy did the easy part first, attacking the underbrush with the humming saw. \"So, Tally, there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s kind of confusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saw glanced off metal, sending up a smattering of sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first day you were here, you said you left the city with two weeks of food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it took you nine days to get here, you should only have had five days of food left. Maybe fifteen packets altogether. But I remember on that first day, when I looked into your bag, I was, like, \u0027She\u0027s got tons!\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally swallowed, trying not to show any expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it turns out I was right. Twelve plus six plus eight is...twenty-six?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, working the saw carefully beneath a low branch. \"I thought so. But you left the citybefore your birthday, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally thought fast. \"Sure. But I guess I didn\u0027t really eat three meals every day, Croy. Like I said, I was pretty sick of SpagBol after a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like you didn\u0027t eat much at all, for such a long trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally struggled to do the math in her head, to figure out what sort of numbers would add up. She remembered what Shay had said that first night: Some Smokies were suspicious of her, worried that she might be a spy. Tally had thought they all accepted her by now. Apparently not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, trying to keep the fear out of her voice. \"Look, Croy, let me tell you something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I probably left the city with more than just two weeks\u0027 worth of food. I never really counted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you kept saying - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I might have exaggerated a little, just to make the trip sound more interesting, you know? Like I could have run out of food when the rangers didn\u0027t turn up. But you\u0027re right, I always had plenty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" He looked up at her, smiling gently. \"I thought maybe so. Your trip did sound a little bit too...interesting to be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But most of what I said was - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" The saw whined to a stop in his hand. \"I\u0027m sure most of it was. Question is, how much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally met his piercing eyes, struggling to think of what to say. It was nothing but a few extra food packets, hardly proof that she was a spy. She should just laugh it off. But the fact that he was dead right silenced her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want the saw for a while?\" he said mildly. \"Clearing this up is hard work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince they were clearing brush, there was no load of metal to take back at midday, so the railroad crew had brought their lunch out with them: potato soup, and bread with salty olives dotted through it. Tally was glad when Shay took her lunch away from the rest of the group, to the edge of the dense forest. She followed, settling next to her friend in the dappled light. \"I need to talk to you, Shay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay, not looking at her, sighed softly as she tore her bread into pieces. \"Yeah, I guess you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Did he talk to you, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay shook her head. \"He didn\u0027t have to say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it\u0027s obvious. Ever since you got here. I should have seen it right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never - \" Tally started, but her voice betrayed her. \"What are you saying? You think Croy\u0027s right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay sighed. \"I\u0027m just saying that - \" She stopped and turned to face Tally. \"Croy? What about Croy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was talking to me before lunch, and he noticed my sweater and asked if I got a sleeping bag. And he figured that after nine days getting here I had too much SpagBol left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had too muchwhat ?\" Shay\u0027s expression was one of total confusion. \"What on earth are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember when I got here? I told everyone that...\" Tally trailed off, for the first time noticing Shay\u0027s eyes. They were lined with red, as if she hadn\u0027t slept. \"Wait a second, what did you think I was talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay held out a hand, fingers splayed. \"This.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold out yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally opened one hand, making a mirror image of Shay\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same size,\" Shay said. She turned both her palms up. \"Same blisters, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally looked down and blinked. If anything, Shay\u0027s hands were in worse shape, red and dry and cracked with the ragged edges of burst blisters. Shay always worked so hard, diving in first, always taking the hardest jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally\u0027s fingers went to the gloves tucked into her belt. \"Shay, I\u0027m sure David didn\u0027t mean to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he did. People always think long and hard about gifts in the Smoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally bit her lip. It was true. She pulled the gloves from her belt. \"You should take them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I. Don\u0027t. Want. Them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally sat back, stunned. First Croy, now this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I guess you don\u0027t.\" She dropped the gloves. \"But Shay, shouldn\u0027t you talk to David before you go nuts about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay chewed at a fingernail, shaking her head. \"He doesn\u0027t talk to me that much anymore. Not since you showed up. Not about anything important. He\u0027s got stuff on his mind, he says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Tally gritted her teeth. \"I never...I mean, I like David, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not your fault, okay? I know that.\" Shay reached out and gave Tally\u0027s heart-shaped pendant a little flick. \"And besides, maybe your mysterious someone will show up, and it won\u0027t matter anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally nodded. True enough, once the Specials got here, Shay\u0027s romantic life would be the least of anyone\u0027s worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you even mentioned that to David? It seems like it might be an issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just never came up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShay\u0027s mouth tightened. \"That\u0027s convenient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally let out a groan. \"But Shay, you said it yourself: I wasn\u0027t supposed to be giving out directions to the Smoke. I feel really bad about the whole thing. I\u0027m not going to go advertising it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except by wearing that thing around your neck. Which didn\u0027t do much good, though, since apparently David didn\u0027t notice it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally sighed. \"Or maybe he doesn\u0027t care, because this is all just in your...\" She couldn\u0027t finish. It wasn\u0027t just in Shay\u0027s head; she could see it now, and feel it too. When David showed her the railway cave, and told her his secret about his parents, he had trusted her, even when he shouldn\u0027t have. And now this present. Could it really be just Shay overreacting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a quiet part of her mind, Tally realized that she hoped it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, expelling the thought. \"Shay, what do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About why you wear that heart.
