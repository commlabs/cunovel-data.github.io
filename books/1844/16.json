Millicent was as determined as I was, of course, and she had servants scour the countryside looking for these women. I don\u0027t know what I would have done without her assistance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Millicent\u0027s a dear woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, she is,\" Judith agreed. \"She sends you her love, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine nodded. \"Tell me what you learned from all of these midwives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be completely honest with you, at first I heard so many conflicting opinions, I almost lost heart. One would tell me the chamber had to be as hot as purgatory during the laboring, and another would be vehemently in favor of just the opposite. Aye, it was frustrating, Frances Catherine. Then a miracle came about. One morning a midwife named Maude marched into the keep, acting very like she owned the place. She was old, terribly fragile-looking, with stooped shoulders and gnarled hands. She was a sight, all right. I\u0027ll confess I had immediate misgivings about her knowledge. I quickly realized how foolish that conclusion was. Frances Catherine, she is the dearest of women. She was full of insight, too, and told me that most of her opinions were based on just plain sense. She\u0027s been a midwife for ages and ages, but her methods are really quite modern. She\u0027s kept up with all the changes and says she\u0027s always interested in hearing about the newest techniques. She\u0027s a dedicated midwife. If she hadn\u0027t been so old and fragile, I would have begged her to come here with me. The journey would have been too much for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The women would never have allowed her interference,\" Frances Catherine said. \"You don\u0027t understand, Judith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then help me understand. Have you spoken to the midwives here about your fears?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord, no,\" Frances Catherine answered in a rush. \"If I told her I was frightened, she\u0027d only make it worse. Her name\u0027s Agnes, and I don\u0027t want her near me when my time comes. She and another woman named Helen are the only two midwives here. They\u0027re both very high- and mighty-acting. Agnes\u0027s daughter, Cecilia, is supposed to marry Iain when he gets around to asking, and I think that\u0027s the reason Agnes always has her nose in the air. She thinks she\u0027s going to become the laird\u0027s mother-in-law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith\u0027s heart felt as though it had just dropped to the bottom of her stomach. She turned her gaze to the tabletop so Frances Catherine wouldn\u0027t notice how upset she was by this news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friend didn\u0027t notice. She continued right along with her explanation. \"The marriage isn\u0027t certain in anyone\u0027s mind but Agnes\u0027s, and Patrick doesn\u0027t believe Iain has any intention of offering for Cecilia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why does Agnes believe he will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her daughter is a beautiful woman. \u0027Tis the truth she\u0027s probably the prettiest woman in the whole clan. It\u0027s a shallow reason, but Agnes thinks that because her daughter is so appealing, Iain will eventually want her. Cecilia\u0027s dim-witted and can\u0027t hold a thought longer than a flea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith shook her head. \"Shame on you for saying such cruel things about this woman.\" She tried to sound as though she meant what she had just said, but ruined the effect completely by bursting into laughter. \"A flea, Frances Catherine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friend nodded. Then she started laughing. \"Oh, Judith, I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just as happy to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine\u0027s change in mood happened so quickly, Judith was quite astonished. She had been laughing just a moment before and was now looking like she was going to cry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude had told Judith that expectant mothers were prone to emotional outbursts. She had also said that a calm, peaceful frame of mind was imperative for an uncomplicated delivery. Whenever the mother became upset, she was to be soothed as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith followed that dictate now. She patted Frances Catherine\u0027s hand and smiled at her. She tried to act confident. \"Do about what? Everything\u0027s going to be fine, Frances Catherine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agnes won\u0027t let you assist me when my laboring starts. And I won\u0027t have that vile woman near me. So what are we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mentioned another midwife named Helen? What about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agnes taught her everything she knows,\" Frances Catherine replied. \"I don\u0027t believe I want her near me, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have to be more midwives here,\" Judith said. \"From the number of cottages and the crowd I spotted when I arrived, I guessed there were nearly five hundred men and women living here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d guess twice that number,\" Frances Catherine estimated. \"You didn\u0027t see all the cottages along the back side of the mountain. Only the warriors are counted, and their number swells to over six hundred at the very least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there have to be other midwives here,\" Judith said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine shook her head. \"Agnes runs things,\" she explained. \"And because I\u0027m the laird\u0027s sister-in-law, she will insist on delivering the babe. If there are other midwives, they keep quiet about it. They wouldn\u0027t want to get Agnes riled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith suddenly felt sick. Panic was beginning to take hold inside. Dear heavens, she wasn\u0027t qualified to take on this duty alone. Yes, she had gathered information about the latest birthing methods, but she\u0027d never been allowed to witness an actual delivery, and she felt completely inadequate overseeing Frances Catherine\u0027s care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy wasn\u0027t anything ever easy? Judith had pictured herself mopping her friend\u0027s brow during the pains, holding her hand, too, and occasionally whispering \"There, there,\" while the experienced midwife took care of the more necessary duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears were once again streaming down Frances Catherine\u0027s face. Judith let out a little sigh. \"Only one thing is certain,\" she announced. \"You\u0027re going to have this baby. I\u0027m here to help you, and surely between the two of us, we can solve any problem, no matter how impossible it seems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer matter-of-fact tone of voice soothed Frances Catherine. \"Yes,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it possible to win Agnes over or do we give up on her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We give up,\" Frances Catherine answered. \"She won\u0027t change her ways. She\u0027s cruel-hearted, Judith. Every chance she gets, she makes horrid remarks about the pain I\u0027m going to have to endure. She likes to tell stories about other difficult birthings, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mustn\u0027t listen to her,\" Judith said. Her voice shook with anger. She had never heard of anything so appalling. Agnes did sound cruel-hearted. Judith shook her head while she thought about this bleak situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re doing,\" her friend whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to understand Agnes, aren\u0027t you? Once you come up with a reason for her behavior, you\u0027ll set out to change it. It won\u0027t matter to me,\" she added. \"I don\u0027t care if she turns into an angel. She isn\u0027t coming near me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not trying to understand her. I already know why she acts the way she does. She\u0027s after power, Frances Catherine. She uses fear and a woman\u0027s vulnerability to get what she wants. She feeds on their weakness. Maude told me there are women like her. Nothing I can do will change her attitude, either. Don\u0027t you worry. I won\u0027t let her near you. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine nodded. \"I don\u0027t feel so alone any longer,\" she confessed. \"Whenever I try to talk to Patrick about the birthing, he gets very upset. He\u0027s afraid for me, and I always end up comforting him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He loves you,\" Judith said. \"That\u0027s why he\u0027s worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine why he loves me. I\u0027ve been so difficult lately. I cry all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t anything wrong with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine smiled. Judith had always been her champion. She felt very fortunate to have her for her friend. \"I\u0027ve talked long enough about my problems. Now I want to talk about yours. Are you going to try to see your father while you\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith shrugged. \"It has become a little more complicated. First, I didn\u0027t realize how large these Highlands are,\" she said. \"And second, I heard the Macleans were feuding with the Maitlands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find that out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith explained about the discussion she\u0027d had with Isabelle\u0027s mother. Frances Catherine was frowning when she finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What she told you is true. The Macleans are enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father might be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked Patrick to tell me what the Maclean laird was like, pretending only mild curiosity, of course, and he said he was an old man who had ruled his clan for many years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did he tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing else,\" Frances Catherine said. \"I didn\u0027t want to prod him. He\u0027d ask me why I was so interested in the Macleans if I asked too many questions. I gave you my promise never to tell anyone who your father was, and since I made that promise before I married Patrick, I can\u0027t tell him. Besides, he\u0027d have heart palpitations. Judith, no one must ever know, not while you\u0027re here. It would be dangerous for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain would protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t know about Maclean,\" she argued. \"I don\u0027t know what he would do if he found out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he would still protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, you sound certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith smiled. \"I am certain,\" she said. \"But it doesn\u0027t matter, does it? Iain\u0027s never going to find out. I\u0027m not even sure I want to meet my father. I had hoped to see him from a distance, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what would that accomplish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My curiosity would be appeased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should talk to him,\" Frances Catherine insisted. \"You don\u0027t know if he banished your mother or not. You need to find out the truth. You certainly can\u0027t believe your mother\u0027s story, not after all the lies you\u0027ve been told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know for certain he never came to England to get us,\" Judith argued. Her hand instinctively went to her bosom. Her father\u0027s ring was nestled between her br**sts on the gold chain, hidden beneath her gown. She should have left the ring at home, but she hadn\u0027t been able to do that. She couldn\u0027t understand why. Lord, it was a confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let her hand drop back to the tabletop. \"Promise me that if a way doesn\u0027t present itself, you\u0027ll let this go. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Catherine agreed just to placate her friend. She could tell this was a painful discussion for Judith. She decided to change the subject, and began to reminisce about some of their adventures at the festivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn no time at all, both women were laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick could hear the sound of his wife\u0027s laughter outside. He smiled in reaction. Her friend was already helping. Brodick walked by Patrick\u0027s side. He also smiled. \"Frances Catherine is pleased to have Judith here,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, she is,\" Patrick replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still smiling when he walked into the cottage. His wife remembered her manners this time. She immediately stood up and walked over to her husband. Judith also stood up. She folded her hands together and called her greeting to both warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick carried three of her satchels inside. Patrick carried two. The men dropped the baggage on the bed. \"Exactly how long are you planning to stay, lass?\" Patrick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded worried. Judith couldn\u0027t resist teasing him. \"Just a year or two,\" she answered. He tried not to blanch. She laughed. \"I was jesting,\" she told him then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick, you must stay for supper,\" Frances Catherine said. \"Judith, don\u0027t jest with Patrick. You\u0027ve made the color drain from his face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth women thought that fact was vastly amusing. They were still laughing when Alex and Gowrie appeared in the opened doorway. The two warriors looked a little sheepish. Frances Catherine immediately invited them to supper too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick seemed surprised to have visitors. Judith helped her friend finish the preparations for the meal. Frances Catherine had made a thick lamb stew and had baked round loaves of rich, black bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men crowded around the table. Judith and Frances Catherine served them before squeezing in next to Patrick to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Judith nor Frances Catherine had much of an appetite. They talked to each other all through the supper. Alex did more staring at Judith than eating, Patrick noticed, and when he realized Gowrie hadn\u0027t touched his food, either, the reason for their spontaneous visit became clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both taken with Judith. Patrick had to restrain himself from laughing. The ladies were oblivious to the men. They excused themselves from the table and went over to the bed. Judith gave her friend all the presents she\u0027d made, then blushed with pleasure over Frances Catherine\u0027s joy. All but one of the gifts were for the baby, but Judith had also made her friend a beautiful white nightgown with pink and blue roses embroidered along the neckline. It had taken Judith a full month to finish the garment. The work had been worth the effort, for Frances Catherine thought the gown was exquisite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the women weren\u0027t paying the men any attention, the men didn\u0027t find it necessary to hide their interest. Their gazes were centered on Judith. Patrick noticed that whenever she smiled, so did the soldiers. Brodick\u0027s interest surprised Patrick the most because he was usually quite good at keeping his emotions under tight rein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you grinning about?\" Brodick suddenly asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Patrick answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Brodick could take exception to that honest reply, Judith called out, \"Brodick, I\u0027ve forgotten to take the sweet biscuits over to Isabelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see she gets them,\" Brodick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith shook her head. \"I want to meet her,\" she explained. She stood up and walked over to the table. \"I have messages to give her from her mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be happy to show you the way,\" Alex volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" Gowrie announced in a much firmer voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick shook his head. \"Isabelle is my sister-in-law,\" he snapped. \"I\u0027ll show Judith the way.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-16.html","bookId":1844,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM"}
