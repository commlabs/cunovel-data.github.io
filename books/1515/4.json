As she neared the building\u0027s main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she\u0027d just received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sign on the door announced:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(SMSC)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building\u0027s natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. \"Ms. Solomon!\" He smiled broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Redskins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed, looking guilty. \"Pregame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"I won\u0027t tell.\" She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine\u0027s eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Ms. Solomon?\" the guard whispered jokingly. \"Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you\u0027re doing back there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up. \"Someday, Kyle. Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he pressed. \"A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation\u0027s statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, the room was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon\u0027s grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. \"Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe docent hesitated. \"I\u0027m not sure, sir. When does it start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn\u0027t imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter\u0027s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar southern accent answered. \"Peter Solomon\u0027s office, this is Anthony. May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anthony!\" Langdon said with relief. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I\u0027m standing in the Statuary Hall, but there\u0027s nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe so, sir. Let me check.\" His assistant paused a moment. \"Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was confused. \"No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I recall that.\" There was a silence on the line. \"That was a bit careless of you, don\u0027t you think, Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was now fully alert. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider this . . .\" the man said. \"You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon\u0027s assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a chill race through his body. \"Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you\u0027re in Washington today.\" The man\u0027s southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. \"You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. \"Who the hell are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s reply was a silky calm whisper. \"Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summoned?\" Langdon felt like a caged animal. \"Try kidnapped!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly.\" The man\u0027s voice was eerily serene. \"If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now.\" He let the words hang for a moment. \"My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation.\" No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon\u0027s unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. \"Look, I don\u0027t know what the hell is going on here, but I\u0027m hanging up--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unwise,\" said the man. \"Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon\u0027s soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon drew a sharp breath. \"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you heard me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way this man had uttered Peter\u0027s name had stopped Langdon cold. \"What do you know about Peter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0027t be happening. \"You don\u0027t have Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m calling the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need,\" the man said. \"The authorities will join you momentarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is this lunatic talking about? Langdon\u0027s tone hardened. \"If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now.\" \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place.\" The man paused. \"He is in the Araf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s religious and literary references solidified Langdon\u0027s suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. \"You\u0027re saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s words hung in Langdon\u0027s ear. \"Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly, no.\" \"Not exactly?!\" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. \"Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon tried to process this. \"What do you want from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Langdon said, \"if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon,\" the man snapped. \"I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind\u0027s pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stark words left Langdon confused. \"Then what the hell is this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man paused for several seconds. \"As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ancient portal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you have lost your mind. \"I\u0027m sorry, but you\u0027ve chosen poorly,\" Langdon said. \"I don\u0027t know anything about any ancient portal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon.\" \"What?\" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a stab of anger. \"I\u0027m warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s far too late for that,\" the man said in an amused tone. \"I\u0027ve already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter? \"I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As above, so below,\" the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. \"Look, I don\u0027t know how to find any ancient portal. I\u0027m calling the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It really hasn\u0027t dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will,\" he replied, chuckling. \"Any moment now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was coming from the Rotunda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He pulled it out of his sling,\" someone said frantically, \"and just left it there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body\u0027s most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike real skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stopped abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he saw the blood. My God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon\u0027s attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy isn\u0027t Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine\u0027s work at the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as \"The Street,\" the corridor connected the building\u0027s five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building\u0027s more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. \"What in the world is that?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother chuckled and kept walking. \"Pod Three. It\u0027s called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five,\" her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. \"It\u0027s our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine glanced over. \"Empty? So why are we looking at it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother\u0027s gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. \"It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you\u0027ve been developing for all these years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine stared at her brother in shock. \"But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it\u0027s one of the world\u0027s most advanced scientific research facilities. We\u0027re constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Already in place.\" He smiled broadly. \"The lab is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine stopped short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother pointed down the long corridor. \"We\u0027re going to see it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine could barely speak. \"You . . . you built me a lab?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you\u0027ve proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory.\" Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. \"Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, I can\u0027t possibly--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody\u0027s using Pod Five right now. When you\u0027re done with your experiments, you\u0027ll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePOD 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. \"You sure you\u0027re ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. My brother, always the showman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand back.\" Peter hit the keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steel door hissed loudly open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses,\" her brother said, \"and you get the basic idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine felt herself take a step backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. \"How far back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It\u0027s exceptionally dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine peered tentatively around the corner. \"No light switch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . . then how can a lab function?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked. \"Hydrogen fuel cell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine\u0027s jaw dropped. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What\u0027s more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or \"white noise.\" This included interference as subtle as \"brain radiation\" or \"thought emissions\" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn\u0027t work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go back and have a look.\" Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. \"Just follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter?\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leap of faith,\" he called back, his voice already fading away. \"You\u0027ll find your way. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s kidding, right? Katherine\u0027s heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can\u0027t see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. \"Peter?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll find your way. Trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was three years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar more important, her brother\u0027s other prediction had come true as well: Katherine\u0027s experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steel door hissed open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangest commute on earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside.
