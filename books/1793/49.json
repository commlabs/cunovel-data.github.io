And for the record, I did not have those relationships simultaneously. Hell, I\u0027ve only dated maybe a half dozen different women in the past three years. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s excessive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother and your grandmother and your sisters do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all obsessed with the idea of getting me married again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They think you\u0027ve got some kind of psychological block. They\u0027ve all decided that you\u0027ve got a problem with getting serious about another woman because you\u0027re afraid of losing her the way you lost Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick watched Carson poke at a hole in the sand with a long stick while he tried to decide how to respond to that. \"What do you think?\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" Sullivan seemed surprised to be asked for his opinion. He halted beside a rock. \"I think you just haven\u0027t found the right woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick realized he had been braced for a lecture. He allowed himself to relax slightly. \"Yeah, that\u0027s sort of how I see it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Octavia is different, isn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for letting down his guard. \"Mitchell sent for you, didn\u0027t he? That\u0027s why you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch feels protective toward Octavia Brightwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Octavia can take care of herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" Sullivan asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Nick a beat or two to grasp that. \"Don\u0027t tell me that you\u0027re afraid that I\u0027m the one who might be in trouble here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan\u0027s gaze rested on Carson and Winston, who had moved on to explore the entrance of a shallow cave. \"Got one question for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you give Octavia The Talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn. I\u0027m starting to think that everyone in the Northwest knows all the details of my social life. A guy could get paranoid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t answer my question. Did you give Octavia your patented lecture on the subject of keeping things light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what? I\u0027m not going to answer that question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan nodded. \"Things went wrong this time around, didn\u0027t they? Mitch was right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027d better change the subject, Granddad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a good idea. Relationship counseling isn\u0027t exactly my forte. But for what it\u0027s worth, I came here to see what was going on, not to put pressure on you. I figure you can handle your own love life without my interference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick raised his brows. \"I\u0027m stunned. Since when did anyone in our family ever hesitate to apply pressure whenever the opportunity arose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan exhaled heavily. \"I put enough pressure on you when you were growing up. Always figured you\u0027d take over Harte Investments, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t handle it well that day when you came to me and told me that you were leaving the company. Lost my temper. Said some things I shouldn\u0027t have said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both did,\" Nick said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hamilton cornered me in my office that same afternoon. He was mad as hell. Angrier than I\u0027d ever seen him. Told me to back off and leave you alone. Told me that you and Lillian and Hannah all had the right to make your own choices in life the same way I\u0027d made mine and that he wasn\u0027t going to stand by and let me pressure any of you into doing what I wanted you to do. He really let me have it that day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad said all that?\" Nick was surprised. He had known that he\u0027d had his father\u0027s support when he made the decision to leave the company but he hadn\u0027t realized that Hamilton had gone toe-to-toe with Sullivan over the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Looking back, I can see that he was trying to protect you and your sisters from the kind of pressure I\u0027d put him under when he was growing up. I didn\u0027t mean to force anyone into a mold, you know. It\u0027s just that I had always had this vision of H.I. descending down through the family. I couldn\u0027t believe that my grandson didn\u0027t want what I had spent so much of my life creating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is,\" Nick said, groping for the words he needed, \"Harte was your creation. I needed something that was all mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you found it in your writing. I understand that now.\" Sullivan\u0027s jaw tightened. \"Something I\u0027ve always wondered, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick glanced at him warily. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it your leaving Harte after your first book was published that put the strain on your marriage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick sucked in a deep breath. \"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t. It was your grandmother who guessed that things weren\u0027t going so well between you and Amelia there at the end. She had a hunch that the problems started when you decided to quit Harte. She always felt that, for Amelia, the company was part of the deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know what to say, Nick thought. He had never realized that anyone had known about the fault line in his marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandmother is right,\" he said after a moment. \"Amelia was having an affair with the man who was flying the plane that day. I think that, if she had lived, there would have been a divorce. She wanted out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you wouldn\u0027t have been able to handle her cheating. You\u0027re a Harte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured it was something like that.\" Sullivan kept his attention on Carson and Winston. \"That\u0027s the real reason why you\u0027ve been so cautious about getting serious with another woman. Got burned once and you\u0027re a mite nervous about sticking your finger back in the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit. Seems like everyone is trying to psychoanalyze me these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan\u0027s brows bristled into a sharp frown. \"Who\u0027s everyone? Far as I know, only Rachel figured out the problems between you and Amelia. We never mentioned them to anyone else in the family or outside, for that matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Octavia about how it was between Amelia and me. She leaped to the same conclusion that Grandma did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh. Women. Always trying to analyze what makes a man tick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only they knew how simple we really are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better to keep \u0027em guessing,\" Nick said. \"Probably makes us appear more interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" Sullivan dug the tip of his cane into the coarse sand and started walking again. \"Well, I think we\u0027ve exhausted that subject. Tell me about this missing painting. You really trying to play private eye like that guy, John True, in your books?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got into it because Virgil, A.Z., and Octavia asked me to look around a bit.\" Nick fell into step beside him. \"They didn\u0027t think Valentine was looking in the right places, and they may have had a point. He suspects one of the Heralds probably took it and arranged to unload it in Seattle or Portland. He figures it\u0027s long gone.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-49.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
