I turned my head to ask what he was doing when I caught the look in his eyes. He used his hands to turn me by my waist, his fingers at the edge of my shirt as a shiver ran down my spine and heat flooded my center. He lifted the edge of my shirt and pulled it up over my head. His eyes were on my red lace bra and his finger traced the edge of it. I put my hands up the front of his shirt, feeling his smooth skin. He took his hands away from me and put them on the wall behind his head. Dragging his shirt up and over, his hands then came to the button of my jeans. My stomach muscles contracted at his touch. My breaths were becoming erratic from having him this close to me, touching him. Asher touching me. I prayed that no one interrupted us this time and quickly moved my hands to the front of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, he captured my hands and pulled them away from his skin. Startled, I looked up at him. His mouth crashed into mine, his tongue swept the seam of my mouth and mine opened under his. My hands grabbed his head, holding him closer, deepening the kiss. His hands slid down my waist to my ass and he picked me up. My jeans fell to the floor and my legs circled his hips. He walked five steps to set me down on the basin of the sink. His hand went to my hair and he tugs out my hair tie. My hair fell down around me and he wrapped his fist in it, tugging my head to the side so he could kiss me harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body was on fire and my panties were soaked. I tightened my legs around him, trying to get some friction to relieve the ache that he created. He growled and pulled his lower body slightly away from me. I whimpered and my head fell back against the mirror. His lips trailed down my neck, breathing heavily. My thighs started shaking as he kissed down my neck, over my collar bone, to the edge of my lace bra. Then his mouth was sucking my nipple through the lace. The friction was intense. “Asher,” I whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, baby.” Then he sucked harder and I could feel his teeth scrape against my sensitive flesh. His hand traveled down my side to the edge of my panties. Near my hip, I felt his finger sliding under the edge and traveling along the inside of my thigh. He was approaching my core and I started panting. His hands and mouth felt amazing on me but I needed more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my lip, I looked down at him. It was the most erotic thing I’ve ever seen. His hand pulled down the cups of my bra then his mouth latched back on. His hand went to my other nipple, pulling and rolling it between his fingers. My head trashed then his mouth was back on mine. My hands traveled down his back, around to the front of his jeans so I could get his button undone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used my toes to shove his jeans and boxers down his hips then I watched as he sprang free. His cock is as beautiful as he is. Long and thick, I just want to wrap my mouth around it but I\u0027m pinned to the counter. I wrapped my hand around him and pumped once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit!” Asher growled and pulled away from my grasp. His mouth was trailing down my body, licking and biting. His hand went to my panties and he grabbed the material at my core and ripped them away. “You’re soaked, baby. Do you want my mouth or my cock?” This was such a complicated question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted both but all I could say was, “Please.” Then his hot mouth was on me sucking, licking, and consuming me like he was starving. His hands went to my ass, pulling me closer. My hands went to his head, holding him to me. His fingers slid in and I shattered, screaming out his name. My body was shaking. Never have I felt that way in my life. It was one of those mind blowing, body shaking orgasms that everyone talks about. I floated slowly back to earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes, Asher was leaning over me. “Please tell me that you’re on birth control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I cried, feeling the length of him against me. Then he slammed into me. I screamed his name and his forehead dropped to my chest and he stilled his movements. I rolled my hips, trying to get him to give me what I needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head came up. “Don’t move, baby,” he whispered. I watched as he took a deep breath then he pulled out and slid back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy back bowed. “Please, Asher,” I cried, digging my nails into his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold onto me, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed on to him and wrapped my legs around his waist. He carried me to the bed. Once he laid me down, he grabbed my hips and slammed into me over and over. My head went back and my eyes closed. He was hitting the perfect spot and his fingers were digging into my hips. The pain and pleasure that I was feeling was making me cry out with each thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at me.” He growled. My head tipped down and he kissed me deeply. I tore my mouth away and my head flew against the mattress as I felt myself start to come. “Look at me, November.” He growled again and my eyes came to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t come until I come with you,” he said, pounding into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going to come now,” I told him, feeling my insides tighten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet. Hold it.” Oh God, I didn’t know if I could hold it. My body was on fire. I bit down on his shoulder, trying to control my orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, come now,” he roared and I felt him swell as my body exploded around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was floating with a million colors dancing around me. My face went into his neck, my arms and legs tightened around him, holding him close. We stayed like that for a long time, just holding each other closely. Our breathing evened out and he lifted his head. I pulled my face out of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay, baby?” he asked, his eyes searching my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing,” I said, leaning in and kissing him softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, your pussy is as beautiful as you are.” He tightened his arms around me. “And as sweet as your mouth.” I had never had a guy go down on me before. I thought it would be uncomfortable but it was amazing. All I could do was smile. “What’s that look?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I’ve never done that before. I mean, I’ve done it but never had a guy do that to me.” He started chuckling. His body was still surrounding me and I could still feel him inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kidding, right?” he asked. I felt embarrassed and my body went tight. I looked over his shoulder, wondering why I had no filter with him. It was like whatever was on my mind came out like word vomit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should, um, turn off the shower,” I told his shoulder. That wasn’t a lie. There was steam rolling out of the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just saying we don’t want to run out of hot water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“November, look at me.” At his tone, my eyes went to his. He cupped my cheek in his big palm and kissed me softly. “You never have to be embarrassed. Trust me, I\u0027m fucking thankful that I\u0027m the only one who has gotten to see you like that.” I felt my nose sting and I shoved my face in his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I whispered. He made me feel beautiful and special, like I had known him forever rather than just a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, let’s have a shower,” he said, picking me up. My legs were still around him and I could feel him inside me. The movement caused me to moan. “You’re going to get soapy and play with yourself while I watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I whispered, feeling nervous and excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard me,” he said, nipping my neck. He stood me up in the shower and handed me a bottle of body wash and a sponge. As directed, I got soapy and played with myself. Then, he played with me. Then, I played with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got out and dried off, he carried me to bed without bothering with clothes. He wrapped his body around mine and we fell asleep. It was definitely the best day of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo maybe I\u0027m more like my grandmother than I thought. I mean I love shopping as much as the next woman but seriously, it’s almost ten at night and we’re just now heading home from our girls’ day out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day started with Asher waking me with his mouth and fingers then he had me get on top and ride him until we both collapsed back into bed breathing heavily. We made breakfast and drank coffee out on the deck while watching Beast chase wild turkeys around the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher’s mom showed up at eleven thirty when I was still in the bathroom putting on makeup. I just had to put my clothes on so I chose a pair of dark jeans and an empire waist floral tank top and a mint green cardigan over it with knee high brown boots. They have a low heel so they’re comfortable for walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked into the kitchen and Asher was standing near the sink in jeans, bare feet and a black thermal long sleeve shirt that had buttons at the neck that were undone. His face was extra scruffy so he looked exceptionally sexy. I wanted to send his mom home and drag him back to bed for the day. His eyes came to me and he did a head to toe inspection and gave me a sweet smile. His eyes were warm and as I bit my lip, they dropped to my mouth and I got the dimple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready to go, beautiful girl?” his mom asked, making me jump. I felt heat hit my cheeks because I forgot that she was there the minute I saw Asher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, yeah. Can we stop at my dad’s so I can drop off Beast?” I asked, looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beast is going with me, baby. I\u0027m meeting Trevor to help him with some shit at his house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, now come kiss before you leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Asher,” I said in a warning tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, get your ass over here. If I have to come to you, you’re not going to like it.” I feel my nipples tighten at his tone. I wasn’t so sure that I didn’t want to see what he would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do know that you’re not the boss of me, right?” I asked, crossing my arms over my chest to hide how turned on I was. He didn’t miss the gesture and a smug smile slid across his face. “Whatever,” I muttered and grabbed my bag off the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at Asher’s mom, I asked, “Ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could make it five steps, I was spun around and Asher’s mouth was on mine. I tried to fight him but his hand twisted into the hair at the back of my head. I gasped then his tongue was in my mouth. I couldn’t help but to kiss him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he tears his mouth from mine, he moves his lips near my ear and whispers, “You’re mine. Every inch of you belongs to me. From your sweet mouth to your even sweeter pussy and when I want it, you better give it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bites my earlobe then kisses my nose. I was in a complete Asher fog when I heard Susan call my name. I looked at her and she was smiling. I look up at Asher and he kisses my nose again. “Have fun, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes on him, praying for magical powers that would cause him to light on fire. This didn’t happen and I rolled my eyes. Susan moved to stand in front of Asher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have fun, Ma, and take care of my girl,” he said, bending down to kiss her cheek. He walked us to the door. His mom walked out before me so I slowed my steps and turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on my tiptoes, I kissed Asher and quickly ducked my head before he could get his arms around me. I ran out the door to his mom’s truck. “Bye, honey. Have a good day,” I yelled, looking over my shoulder and laughing. Asher was standing on the porch with arms crossed and feet planted apart. His dimple is out. I hopped up in the truck and shut the door. I heard Asher call Beast who ran over to him and sat at his feet. I waved as we backed out of the driveway. Asher didn’t wave but I did get a chin lift so that’s pretty much the same thing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-november-until-1/page-17.html","bookId":2744,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:13 PM"}
