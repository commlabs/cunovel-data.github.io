On the other hand, Patroni was convinced that those in engineering and maintenance departments behaved like mature adults. Maintenance men (Joe was apt to argue), even when employed by competing airlines, worked closely and harmoniously, sharing their information, experience, and even secrets for the common good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Joe Patroni sometimes confided privately to his friends, an example of this unofficial sharing was the pooling of information which came to maintenance men regularly through conferences held by individual airlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni\u0027s employers, like most major scheduled airlines, had daily telephone conferences---known as \"briefings\"---during which all regional headquarters, bases, and outfield stations were connected through a continent-wide closed-circuit hookup. Directed by a head office vice-president, the briefings were, in fact, critiques and information exchanges on the way the airline had operated during the past twenty-four hours. Senior people throughout the company\u0027s system talked freely and frankly with one another. Operations and sales departments each had their own daily briefing; so did maintenance---the latter, in Patroni\u0027s opinion, by far the most important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the maintenance sessions, in which Joe Patroni took part five days a week, stations reported one by one. Where delays in service---for mechanical reasons---had occurred the previous day, those in charge were required to account for them. Nobody bothered making excuses. As Patroni put it: \"If you goofed, you say so.\" Accidents or failures of equipment, even minor, were reported; the objective, to pool knowledge and prevent recurrence. At next Monday\u0027s session, Patroni would report tonight\u0027s experience with the Aereo-Mexican 707, and his success or failure, however it turned out. The daily discussions were strictly no-nonsense, largely because the maintenance men were tough cookies who knew they couldn\u0027t fool one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter each official conference---and usually unknown to senior managements---unofficial ones began. Patroni and others would exchange telephone calls with cronies in maintenance departments of competing airlines. They would compare notes about one another\u0027s daily conferences, passing on what information seemed worth while. Rarely was any intelligence withheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith more urgent matters---especially those affecting safety---word was passed from airline to airline in the same way, but without the day\u0027s delay. If Delta, for example, had a rotor blade failure on a DC-9 in flight, maintenance departments of Eastern, TWA, Continental, and others using DC-9s, were told within hours; the information might help prevent similar failures on other aircraft. Later, photographs of the disassembled engine, and a technical report, would follow. If they wished, foremen and mechanics from other airlines could widen their knowledge by dropping over for a look-see at the failed part, and any engine damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who, like Patroni, worked in this give-and-take milieu were fond of pointing out that if sales and administration departments of competing airlines had occasion to consult, their people seldom went to one another\u0027s headquarters, but met on neutral ground. Maintenance men, in contrast, visited competitors\u0027 premises with the assurance of a common freemasonry. At other times, if one maintenance department was in trouble, others helped as they were able.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis second kind of help had been sent, tonight, to Joe Patroni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hour and a half since work began in the latest attempt to move the stranded jet from alongside runway three zero, Patroni\u0027s complement of help had almost doubled. He had begun with the original small crew of Aereo-Mexican, supplemented by some of his own people from TWA. Now, digging steadily with the others, were ground crews from Braniff, Pan Am, American, and Eastern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the various newcomers had arrived, in an assortment of airline vehicles, it became evident that news of Patroni\u0027s problem had spread quickly on the airport grapevine, and, without waiting to be asked, other maintenance departments had pitched in. It gave Joe Patroni a good, appreciative feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the extra help, Patroni\u0027s estimate of an hour\u0027s preparatory work had already been exceeded. Digging of twin trenches, floored by heavy timbers, in front of the airliner\u0027s main landing gear had gone ahead steadily---though slowly because of the need for all the men working to seek shelter periodically, to warm themselves. The shelter and the warmth, of a sort, were in two crew buses. As the men entered, they beat their hands and pinched their faces, numb from the biting wind still sweeping icily across the snow-covered airfield. The buses and other vehicles, including trucks, snow clearance equipment, a fuel tanker, assorted service cars, and a roaring power cart---most with beacon lights flashing---were still clustered on the taxiway close by. The whole scene was bathed by floodlights, creating a white oasis of snow-reflected light in the surrounding darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twin trenches, each six feet wide, now extended forward and upward from the big jet\u0027s main wheels to the firmer ground onto which Patroni hoped the airplane could be moved under its own power. At the deepest level of the trenches was a mess of mud beneath snow, which had originally trapped the momentarily strayed airliner. The mud and slush now mingled, but became less viscous as both trenches angled upward. A third trench, less deep, and narrower than the other two, had been dug to allow passage of the nosewheel. Once the firmer ground was reached, the aircraft would be clear of runway three zero, over which one of its wings now extended. It could also be maneuvered with reasonable ease onto the solid surface of the adjoining taxiway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the preparatory work was almost complete, the success of what came next would depend on the aircraft\u0027s pilots, still waiting on the Boeing 707\u0027s flight deck, high above the current activity. What they would have to judge was how much power they could safely use to propel the aircraft forward, without upending it on its nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough most of the time since he arrived, Joe Patroni had wielded a shovel with the rest of the men digging. Inactivity came hard to him. Sometimes, too, he welcomed the chance to keep himself fit; even now, more than twenty years since quitting the amateur boxing ring, he was in better shape physically than most men years his junior. The airline ground crewmen enjoyed seeing Patroni\u0027s cocky, stocky figure working with them. He led and exhorted... \"Keep moving, son, or we\u0027ll figure we\u0027re gravediggers, and you the corpse.\"... \"The way you guys keep heading for that bus, looks like you\u0027ve got a woman stashed there.\"... \"If you lean on that shovel any more, Jack, you\u0027ll freeze solid like Lot\u0027s wife.\"... \"Men, we want this airplane moved before it\u0027s obsolete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, Joe Patroni had not talked with the captain and first officer, having left that to the Aereo-Mexican foreman, Ingram, who had been in charge before Patroni\u0027s arrival. Ingram had passed up a message on the aircraft interphone, telling the pilots what was happening below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, straightening his back, and thrusting his shovel at Ingram, the maintenance chief advised, \"Five minutes more should do it. When you\u0027re ready, get the men and trucks clear.\" He motioned to the snow-shrouded airplane. \"When this one comes out, she\u0027ll be like a cork from a champagne bottle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngram, huddled into his parka, still pinched and cold as he had been earlier, nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While you\u0027re doing that,\" Patroni said, \"I\u0027ll yak with the fly boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old-fashioned boarding ramp which had been trundled from the terminal several hours ago to disembark the stranded passengers was still in place near the aircraft\u0027s nose. Joe Patroni climbed the ramp, its steps covered in deep snow, and let himself into the front passenger cabin. He went forward to the flight deck---with relief, lighting his inevitable cigar as he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to the cold and wind-blown snow outside, the pilots\u0027 cockpit was snug and quiet. One of the communications radios was tuned to soft music of a commercial station. As Patroni entered, the Aereo-Mexican first officer, in shirt-sleeves, snapped a switch and the music stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about doing that.\" The chunky maintenance chief shook himself like a bull terrier while snow cascaded from his clothing. \"Nothing wrong with taking things easy. After all, we didn\u0027t expect you to come down and shovel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the first officer and captain were in the cockpit. Patroni remembered hearing that the flight engineer had gone with the stewardesses and passengers to the terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain, a heavy-set, swarthy man who resembled Anthony Quinn, swiveled around in his port-side seat. He said stiffly, \"We have our job to do. You have yours.\" His English was precise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Patroni acknowledged. \"Only trouble is, our job gets fouled up and added to. By other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are speaking of what has happened here,\" the captain said, \"Madre de Dios!---you do not suppose that I placed this airplane in the mud on purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t.\" Patroni discarded his cigar, which was maimed from chewing, put a new one in his mouth, and lit it. \"But now it\u0027s there, I want to make sure we get it out---this next time we try. If we don\u0027t, the airplane\u0027ll be in a whole lot deeper; so will all of us, including you.\" He nodded toward the captain\u0027s seat. \"How\u0027d you like me to sit there and drive it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain flushed. Few people in any airline talked as casually to four-stripers as Joe Patroni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" the captain said coldly. He might have replied even more unpleasantly, except that at the moment he was suffering acute embarrassment for having got into his present predicament at all. Tomorrow in Mexico City, he suspected, he would face an unhappy, searing session with his airline\u0027s chief pilot. He raged inwardly: Jesucristo y por la amor de Dios!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lotta half-frozen guys outside who\u0027ve been busting their guts,\" Patroni insisted. \"Getting out now\u0027s tricky. I\u0027ve done it before. Maybe you should let me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aereo-Mexican captain bridled. \"I know who you are, Mr. Patroni, and I am told that you are likely to help us move from this bad ground, where others have failed. So I have no doubt that you are licensed to taxi airplanes. But let me remind you there are two of us here who are licensed to fly them. It is what we are paid for. Therefore we shall remain at the controls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself.\" Joe Patroni shrugged, then waved his cigar at the control pedestal. \"Only thing is, when I give the word, open those throttles all the way. And I mean all the way, and don\u0027t chicken out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he left the cockpit, he ignored angry glares from both pilots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, digging had stopped; some of the men who had been working were warming themselves again in the crew buses. The buses and other vehicles---with the exception of the power cart, which was needed for starting engines---were being removed some distance from the airplane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Patroni closed the forward cabin door behind him and descended the ramp. The foreman, huddled deeper than ever into his parka, reported, \"Everything\u0027s set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering his cigar was still lighted, Patroni puffed at it several times, then dropped it into the snow where it went out. He motioned to the silent jet engines. \"Okay, let\u0027s light up all four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral men were returning from the crew bus. A quartet put their shoulders to the ramp beside the aircraft and shoved it clear. Two others responded to the foreman\u0027s shout against the wind, \"Ready to start engines!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the second pair stationed himself at the front of the aircraft, near the power cart. He wore a telephone headset plugged into the fuselage. The second man, with flashlight signal wands, walked forward to where he could be seen by the pilots above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Patroni, with borrowed protective head pads, joined the crewman with the telephone headset. The remainder of the men were now scrambling from the sheltering buses, intent on watching what came next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cockpit, the pilots completed their checklist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground below, the crewman with the telephone set began the jet starting ritual. \"Clear to start engines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause. The captain\u0027s voice. \"Ready to start, and pressurize the manifold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the power cart blower, a stream of forced air hit the air turbine starter of number three engine. Compressor vanes turned, spun faster, whined. At fifteen percent speed, the first officer fed in aviation kerosene. As the fuel ignited, a smoke cloud belched back and the engine took hold with a deep-throated bellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clear to start four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber four engine followed three. Generators on both engines charging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain\u0027s voice. \"Switching to generators. Disconnect ground power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the power cart, electric lines came down. \"Disconnected. Clear to start two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber two took hold. Three engines now. An encompassing roar. Snow streaming behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber one fired and held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disconnect air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disconnected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe umbilical air hose slipped down. The foreman drove the power cart away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFloodlights ahead of the aircraft had been moved to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni exchanged headsets with the crewman near the front of the fuselage. The maintenance chief now had the telephone set, and communication with the pilots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This\u0027s Patroni. When you\u0027re ready up there, let\u0027s roll her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of the aircraft nose, the crewman with the lighted wands held them up, ready to be a guide along an elliptical path beyond the trenches, also cleared at Joe Patroni\u0027s direction. The crewman was ready to run if the 707 came out of the mud faster than expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni crouched close to the nosewheel. If the airplane moved quickly, he, too, was vulnerable. He held a hand near the interphone plug, ready to disconnect. He watched the main landing gear intently for a sign of forward movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain\u0027s voice. \"I am opening up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tempo of the jets increased. In a roar like sustained thunder, the airplane shook, the ground beneath it trembled. But the wheels remained still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni cupped his hands around the interphone mouthpiece. \"More power! Throttles forward all the way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine noise heightened but only slightly. The wheels rose perceptibly, but still failed to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamit! All the way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor several seconds, the engine tempo remained as it was, then abruptly lessened. The captain\u0027s voice rattled the interphone; it had a sarcastic note. \"Patroni, por favor, if I open my throttles all the way, this airplane will stand on its nose. Instead of a stranded 707, we shall both have a wrecked one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maintenance chief had been studying the landing gear wheels, which had now settled back, and the ground around them. \"It\u0027ll come out, I tell you! All it needs is the guts to pull full power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look to your own guts!\" the captain snapped back. \"I am shutting the engines down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni shouted into the interphone. \"Keep those motors running; hold \u0027em at idle! I\u0027m coming up!\" Moving forward under the nose, he motioned urgently for the boarding ramp to be repositioned. But even as it was being pushed into place, all four engines quieted and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the cockpit, both pilots were unfastening their seat harnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni said accusingly, \"You chickened out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain\u0027s reaction was surprisingly mild. \"Es posible. Perhaps it is the only intelligent thing I have done tonight.\" He inquired formally, \"Does your maintenance department accept this airplane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Patroni nodded. \"We\u0027ll take it over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first officer glanced at his watch and made an entry in a log.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you have extricated this airplane, in whatever way,\" the Aereo-Mexican captain stated, \"no doubt your company will be in touch with my company. Meanwhile, buenas noches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two pilots left, their heavy topcoats buttoned tightly at the neck, Joe Patroni made a swift, routine check of instruments and control settings. A minute or so later he followed the pilots down the outside ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aereo-Mexican foreman, Ingram, was waiting below. He nodded in the direction of the departing pilots, now hurrying toward one of the crew buses. \"That was the same thing they done to me; not pulling enough power.\" He motioned gloomily toward the aircraft\u0027s main landing gear. \"That\u0027s why she went in deep before; now she\u0027s dug herself in deeper still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was what Joe Patroni had feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Ingram holding an electric lantern, he ducked under the fuselage to inspect the landing gear wheels; they were back in mud and slush again, almost a foot deeper than before. Patroni took the light and shone it under the wings; all four engine nacelles were disquietingly closer to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing but a sky hook\u0027ll help her now,\" Ingram said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maintenance chief considered the situation, then shook his head. \"We got one more chance. We\u0027ll dig some more, bring the trenches down to where the wheels are now, then start the engines again. Only this time I\u0027ll drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind and snow still howled around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShivering, Ingram acknowledged doubtfully, \"I guess you\u0027re the doctor. But better you than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Patroni grinned. \"If I don\u0027t blast her out, maybe I\u0027ll blow her apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngram headed for the remaining crew bus to call out the men; the other bus had taken the Aereo-Mexican pilots to the terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni calculated: there was another hour\u0027s work ahead before they could try moving the aircraft again. Therefore runway three zero would have to continue out of use for at least that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to his radio-equipped pickup to report to air traffic control. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airport/page-30.html","bookId":1522,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM"}
