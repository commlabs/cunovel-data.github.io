{"id":39379,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. UNWELCOME NEWS.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Shortly after Mr. Craven\u0027s departure, Ben announced that he must be going. Left alone, Frank went into the house. He felt rather sober, for though he did not believe that his mother was in any danger of marrying again—least of all, Mr. Craven—the mere possibility disturbed him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is mother up stairs, Katy?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said Katy, looking very knowing. \"She went up as soon as Mr. Craven went away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He staid a long time. He seems to come here pretty often.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"May be he\u0027ll come oftener and stay longer, soon,\" said Katy, nodding her head vigorously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean, Katy? What makes you say such things?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [22]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do I mane? Why do I say such things? You\u0027ll know pretty soon, I\u0027m thinking.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you\u0027d tell me at once what you mean?\" said Frank, impatiently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Craven doesn\u0027t come here for nothing, bad \u0027cess to him,\" said Katy, oracularly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t mean, Katy—\" exclaimed Frank, in excitement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I mean that you\u0027re goin\u0027 to have a step-father, Master Frank, and a mighty mane one, too; but if your mother\u0027s satisfied, it ain\u0027t for Katy O\u0027Grady to say a word, though he isn\u0027t fit for her to wipe her shoes on him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who told you such a ridiculous story?\" demanded Frank, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He told me himself shure,\" said Katy. \"Didn\u0027t I pop in when he was on his knees at your mother\u0027s feet, and didn\u0027t he ask me to congratulate him, and your mother said never a word? What do you say to that Master Frank, now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think there must be some mistake, Katy,\" said Frank, turning pale. \"I will go and ask my mother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [23]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No wonder the child can\u0027t abide havin\u0027 such a mane step-father as that,\" soliloquized Katy. \"He looks like a sneakin\u0027 hyppercrite, that he does, and I\u0027d like to tell him so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Hunter was an amiable woman, but rather weak of will, and easily controlled by a stronger spirit. She had yielded to Mr. Craven\u0027s persuasions because she had not the power to resist for any length of time. That she did not feel a spark of affection for him, it is hardly necessary to say, but she had already begun to feel a little reconciled to an arrangement which would relieve her from so large a share of care and responsibility. She was placidly thinking it all over when Frank entered the room hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you wiped your feet, Frank?\" she asked, for she had a passion for neatness. \"I am afraid you will track dirt into the room.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes—no—I don\u0027t know,\" answered Frank, whose thoughts were on another subject. \"Has Mr. Craven been here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" replied his mother, blushing a little.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [24]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He seemed to stay pretty long.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He was here about an hour.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He comes pretty often, too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I consult him about my business affairs, Frank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look here, mother, what do you think Ben Cameron told me to-day?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know, I am sure, Frank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He said it was all over the village that you were going to marry him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I—I didn\u0027t think it had got round so soon,\" said the widow, nervously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So soon! Why, you don\u0027t mean to say there\u0027s anything in it, mother?\" said Frank, impetuously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope it won\u0027t displease you very much, Frank,\" said Mrs. Hunter, in embarrassment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it true? Are you really going to marry that man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He didn\u0027t ask me till this afternoon, and, of course, it took me by surprise, and I said so, but he urged me so much that I finally consented.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t love him, mother? I am sure you can\u0027t love such a man as that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [25]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I never shall love any one again in that way, Frank—never any one like your poor father.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then why do you marry him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He doesn\u0027t ask me to love him. But he can relieve me of a great many cares and look after you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want anybody to look after me, mother—that is, anybody but you. I hate Mr. Craven!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now that is wrong, Frank. He speaks very kindly of you—very kindly indeed. He says he takes a great interest in you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry I cannot return the interest he professes. I dislike him, and I always have. I hope you won\u0027t be angry, mother, if I tell you just what I think of him. I think he\u0027s after your property, and that is what made him offer himself. He is poor as poverty, though I don\u0027t care half so much for that as I do for other things.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Frank; you are mistaken there,\" said credulous Mrs. Hunter, eagerly. \"He is not poor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do you know?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [26]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He told me that he had twenty thousand dollars\u0027 worth of mining stock out West somewhere, besides owning a house in New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank looked astonished.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If he has as much property as that,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t see what makes him come here. I don\u0027t believe his business brings him in three hundred dollars a year.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s the very reason, Frank. He has money enough, and doesn\u0027t mind if business is dull. He generously offered to pay—or was it help pay?—the expenses of your education; but I told him that you didn\u0027t need it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If I did, I wouldn\u0027t take it from him. But what you tell me surprises me, mother. He doesn\u0027t look as if he was worth five hundred dollars in the world. What made him tell you all this?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He said that some people would accuse him of being a fortune-hunter, and he wanted to convince me that he was not one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It may be a true story, and it may not,\" said Frank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are really very unjust, Frank,\" said his mother. \"I don\u0027t pretend to love Mr. Craven, and he doesn\u0027t expect it, but I am sure he has [27] been very kind, and he takes a great deal of interest in you, and you will learn to know him better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When you are married to him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mother,\" exclaimed Frank, impetuously, \"don\u0027t marry this man! Let us live alone, as we have done. We don\u0027t want any third person to come in, no matter who he is. I\u0027ll take care of you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are only a boy, Frank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I am already fifteen. I shall soon be a man at any rate, and I am sure we can get along as well as we have done.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Hunter was not a strong or a resolute woman, but even women of her type can be obstinate at times. She had convinced herself, chiefly through Mr. Craven\u0027s suggestion, that the step she was about to take was for Frank\u0027s interest, and the thought pleased her that she was sacrificing herself for him. The fact that she didn\u0027t fancy Mr. Craven, of course heightened the sacrifice, and so Frank found her far more difficult of persuasion than he anticipated. She considered that he [28] was but a boy and did not understand his own interests, but would realize in future the wisdom of her conduct.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have given my promise, Frank,\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you can recall it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would not be right. My dear Frank, why can you not see this matter as I do? I marry for your sake.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, mother, I have the right to ask you not to do it. It will make me unhappy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Frank, you do not know what is best. You are too young.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you are quite determined, mother?\" asked Frank, sadly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I cannot draw back now, Frank. I—I hope you won\u0027t make me unhappy by opposing it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I won\u0027t say another word, mother, since you have made up your mind,\" said Frank, slowly. \"When is it going to be?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do not know yet. Mr. Craven wants it to be soon.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [29]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will let me know when it is decided, mother?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly, Frank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He left the room sad at heart. He felt that for him home would soon lose its charms, and that he would never get over the repugnance which he felt against his future step-father.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81705.html","bookId":376,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM"}
