There\u0027s no recourse except to have another drink. That I\u0027m not driving is the consolation. Trent is standing with a manager and two agents - all of them g*y, one engaged to a woman, the other two still in the closet. I know Trent\u0027s sleeping with the junior agent, blond with fake white teeth, so blandly good-looking he\u0027s not even a variation on a type. I realize I have nothing to say to Trent Burroughs as I tell him, \"I\u0027ve been in New York the last four months.\" New Age Christmas music fails to warm up the chilly vibe. I\u0027m suddenly unsure about everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent looks at me, nodding, slightly bewildered by my presence. He knows he needs to say something. \"So, that\u0027s great about The Listeners. It\u0027s really happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the nonconversation starts itself we enter into a hazy area about a supposed friend of ours, someone named Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly disappeared,\" Trent says, straining. \"Have you heard anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah?\" I ask, and then, \"Wait, what do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly Montrose. He disappeared. No one can find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went out to Palm Springs,\" Trent says. \"They think maybe he met someone online.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent seems to want a reaction. I stare back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s strange,\" I murmur disinterestedly. \"Or ... is he prone to things like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent looks at me as if something has been confirmed, and then reveals his disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prone? No, Clay, he\u0027s not prone to things like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trent - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking away from me, Trent says, \"He\u0027s probably dead, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the veranda overlooking the massive lit pool bordered by palms wrapped in white Christmas lights, I\u0027m smoking a cigarette, contemplating another text from Julian. I look up from the phone when a shadow steps slowly out of the darkness and it\u0027s such a dramatic moment - her beauty and my subsequent reaction to it - that I have to laugh, and she just stares at me, smiling, maybe buzzed, maybe wasted. This is the girl who would usually make me afraid, but tonight she doesn\u0027t. The look is blond and wholesome, midwestern, distinctly American, not what I\u0027m usually into. She\u0027s obviously an actress because girls who look like this aren\u0027t out here for any other reason, and she just gazes at me like this is all a dare. So I make it one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to be in a movie?\" I ask her, swaying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl keeps smiling. \"Why? Do you have a movie you want to put me in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the smile freezes and quickly fades as she glances behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around and squint at the woman heading toward us, backlit by the room she\u0027s leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn back around the girl\u0027s walking away, her silhouette enhanced by the glow of the pool, and from somewhere in the darkness there\u0027s the sound of a fountain splashing, and then the girl is replaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that?\" Blair asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was invited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friends brought me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends? Congratulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas\" again is all I can offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that girl you were talking to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around and glance back into the darkness. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair sighs. \"I thought you were in New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m back and forth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" And then: \"You and Trent still happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here tonight? Who are you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know this was your place,\" I say, looking away. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you know these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you haven\u0027t talked to me in two years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother text from Julian tells me to meet him at the Polo Lounge. Not wanting to go back to the condo, I have the producer drop me off at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Outside, on the patio, next to a heat lamp, Julian sits in a booth, his face glowing while he texts someone. He looks up, smiles. As soon as I slide into the booth a waiter appears and I order a Belvedere on the rocks. When I offer Julian a questioning look he taps a bottle of Fiji water I hadn\u0027t noticed before and says, \"I\u0027m not drinking.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-5.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
