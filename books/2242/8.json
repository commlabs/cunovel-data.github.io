{"id":84818,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003eOf course, I heard from my mother that night. My mother, tall and elegant and reminiscent of Lauren Bacall at her coolest, might as well have been born on a different planet from me; I cannot imagine her carrying me in her womb, no matter what evidence there is to the contrary. I am an only child, and I\u0027ve seen pictures of her pregnant, so I guess I\u0027m really hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was never much a child of my father, except biologically. He left when I was in my teens, my early teens. My mother, in her excellent vengeance, became a real estate tycoon in a modest way - if a tycoon can be modest - and lived in more affluence than I ever would have if I\u0027d stayed with my newspaperman father. He\u0027d remarried, and had a son named Phillip, my half-brother. I hadn\u0027t seen Phillip in years. My father had decided I reminded the boy of a traumatic incident, and that seeing me was bad for Phillip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he got his own computer, Phillip began emailing me. I could tell, in his first messages, Phillip considered himself daring, contacting his dangerous older sister. I replied so calmly and matter-of-factly that it made my teeth ache, but at the same time I tried to make it clear that I was very happy to hear from him. Now we exchanged news once or twice a week. I hadn\u0027t had much to tell him since Martin died (Phillip had sent me the biggest, most sentimental card he could find, covered with a glittery substance). That wasn\u0027t the case tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the phone rang I was busy trying to tell Phillip about the excitement of the movie shoot, without dwelling on the death of Celia Shaw. Seeing the movie set and the movie people through different eyes made me feel better about the whole thing, myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the phone absently, my mind still on my composition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you met up with Arthur Smith today,\" my mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the first time I\u0027d seen him in years,\" I said. \"He looked pretty much the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not dating anyone now,\" my mother informed me, and I didn\u0027t ask her why she\u0027d bothered to find that out. She wasn\u0027t giving me information about an opportunity, she was warning me. She\u0027d never forgiven Arthur for dating Lynn while he was dating me, and especially for getting Lynn pregnant while I should have been. Mother\u0027s slacked off on the grandkid issue since she has some stepgrand-children through her husband, John Queensland. Especially once I told her that I had a malformation of the womb, and it was very unlikely that I would ever be able to have a baby: I\u0027d tried to keep that to myself as long as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even if I told her I was dying to present her with a grandchild, she wouldn\u0027t want Arthur to be the father -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not any more. In her opinion, he\u0027d publicly humiliated me. (Actually, that was true. But I had given up minding.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, that poor girl who died was the one who was going to play you in the movie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, the composite me. Weird feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know Robin Crusoe is here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027ve seen him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does he look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much the same. He dresses better. His hair\u0027s still red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you coming to dinner tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... oh, sure.\" I rolled my eyes at the computer screen. The last thing I wanted was to go to a family dinner with all John\u0027s kids, their spouses, and the children. But I\u0027d agreed a few days ago, guilted out because I\u0027d skipped the last two such gatherings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night, then, at six. Please don\u0027t be late. You can bring someone if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe always said that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be late,\" I said firmly. I never was: Roe Teagarden, punctual librarian. Didn\u0027t I sound exciting? I sighed after we\u0027d said good-bye, pretty much standard ritual after a phone conversation with Aida Teagarden Queensland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my mother had always done her best by me, and she loved me. I loved her too. It would have been nice if I hadn\u0027t had to constantly remind myself of that. Abruptly, I was fed up with my own whininess, and decided it was high time I went to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had certainly been a highly eventful Saturday, compared with my normal weekend routine. I suppressed the memory of Celia\u0027s appearance when she was dead, and instead spun myself a fantasy in which Joel Park Brooks came to my door and begged me to take her place in the movie, and I did so with completely unexpected talent and grace, and some incredibly attractive actor - not anybody obvious like George Clooney or Mel Gibson, but someone more cerebral, like John Cusack - came to my door and begged me to return to Hollywood with him and tan by his pool and be his love goddess, since I was far more genuine and original than the shallow movie beauties surrounding him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no age limit or personality conflict in fantasies, and this one merged pleasantly into sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext morning was a good Sunday for church. I attend on most Sundays, but sometimes I\u0027m more enthusiastic than others. I wasn\u0027t sure what was happening to me, what process had been set in motion this past week, but I was relieved to feel better. I didn\u0027t realize how long a dark cloud had hung around me until it began to lift. I slicked my hair back and put it up as smoothly as I manage, and I wore a fall suit of a russet color. I put on my gold-rimmed glasses, and I had suede pumps and a purse to match. Amber earrings, I decided, and a dab of perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look good,\" I told my mirror earnestly. \"Pretty darn good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to St. Stephen\u0027s about nine-fifteen. We had an early service, since Aubrey also preached at another church about thirty miles away at eleven o\u0027clock. I slipped into the pew I usually used, noticed my mother and John hadn\u0027t gotten there yet, and slid to my knees to pray. Our church is small and beautiful, and just breathing the air of it makes me feel better. The organist began her playing before I\u0027d finished, and I eased back into the pew and listened with my eyes closed. I don\u0027t have much of an ear for music, but I thought I was listening to Handel. The pew creaked as someone sat by me, and I opened my eyes after listening a little longer. Robin was on his knees next to me, wearing a perfectly proper suit and tie. He sat back by me, and began the business of book-marking his hymnal and turning to the proper place in the Book of Common Prayer. When he was arranged to his satisfaction, one of his long, slender hands reached over and patted mine. I turned my hand palm up so he could clasp it, and he gave my fingers a squeeze. His untidy hair was freshly washed and floating around his head in a coppery nimbus, and I averted my face so he couldn\u0027t see me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin released my hand with another pat, and the processional began. We stood to observe it, and bowed at the passage of the cross. I was reminded all over again of how much taller he was than I. As Aubrey, the lector, and the two acolytes disposed themselves at the front of the church, I saw Will Weir, the cameraman, scuttle into the back pew on the other side. He was wearing a sports jacket, a white shirt, and jeans; not standard churchgoing garb in Lawrenceton, but he was a visitor, after all. My mother and her husband had slipped in late, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun poured in the windows of the church and I watched dust motes dance in the beams. The ritual unfolded exactly as it ought, and as the congregation knelt and stood in unison, I felt a deep calm wash over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill scuttled out of the church as fast as he\u0027d scuttled in, so he apparently didn\u0027t want to meet and greet. Astonishingly, Robin went through the whole ritual. I gave him every opportunity to detach himself from me, because I was naturally aware that there was going to be speculation. But with the greatest tenacity, Robin stuck to my side and walked me to my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother wonders if you\u0027d like to come to dinner tonight,\" I heard myself saving. Actually, that was true. She\u0027d yanked me aside and ordered me to extend the invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you feel about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at his small hazel eyes, fringed with rusty lashes. I looked down at my feet. \"If you\u0027d like to come, that would be fine, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come by and pick me up at the hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Five-thirty okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Casual dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. I\u0027ll go home and change to pants and a shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you let your hair down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I hadn\u0027t thought about it,\" I said, more than a little surprised. I started to ask him why he wanted to know, but reined myself in. I also felt an impulse to ask him if he wanted to come home with me for lunch, and zapped that idea, too. Instead, I gave Robin a small smile and wave, and got in my car to go back to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat an interesting morning it had turned out to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur was parked in my driveway when I got back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the hair,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sorted through my keys and nodded in reply as I went to the side door. \"Come on in,\" I called, unlocking the door and deactivating the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur was wearing a suit, and he was clean-shaven, but I was fairly sure he hadn\u0027t been at church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dressed up,\" I said tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on the news.\" He looked embarrassed. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe how many news people are down at the station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been watching the television. I guess it was everywhere on the news.\" Arthur nodded. I was standing in the middle of my kitchen, tucking my keys back into my purse, and thinking as hard as I could. \"Oh, this is bad. They\u0027ll be coming around again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon as they get directions to your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said a very unladylike word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur laughed. \"You can say that again. You know if it gets bad you can come stay with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think not,\" I said, smiling. \"Notorious Widow in Cop\u0027s Love Shack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur took a deep breath. \"Listen, Roe, who in that movie crew was especially close to Celia Shaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost anyone would know more about that than I know.\" I slung the purse onto the counter, slid out of my pumps, and made some fresh coffee. I got a mug out of the cabinet and put it by the coffeepot, and I got out some sugar and milk for Arthur\u0027s coffee. Funny, if you\u0027d asked me how he took it, I wouldn\u0027t have thought I remembered - but here I was, setting out the things he took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have reasons for asking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do. Well, of course, Robin dated her...though there were signs that the relationship was over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like her going to bed with your stepson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, like that. No, really, there were indications before that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seemed to be big buddies with Meredith Askew. I\u0027m not sure how two-way that was, but Celia used Meredith to deliver her messages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about other crew members?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will Weir was with her when I ran into them while they were shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur consulted his notes. \"He would be the head cameraman. I understand he\u0027s more famous in his field that Celia Shaw had gotten to be in hers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he has a few years on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we went out to dinner at Heavenly Barbecue, Mark Chesney went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He the assistant director? The gay one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Well, that is, he\u0027s the assistant director. I don\u0027t know about the gay part.\" Actually, that was a conclusion I\u0027d reached myself. I found that I was unwillingly impressed. There was no telling how many people Arthur had interviewed yesterday. He was definitely on top of this investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you notice anything peculiar about this actress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peculiar? How so? Mentally?\" I\u0027d seldom seen anyone more focused than Celia Shaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Physically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I had noticed some things. She stumbled a lot,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stumbled.\" Arthur looked... not exactly excited, but intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she was a little clumsy on her feet. And once she slapped at the director and looked surprised, like she didn\u0027t know she was going to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur looked down at his feet. He didn\u0027t want me to see his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, are you going to explain?\" I am as curious as the next person, and this was truly aggravating of Arthur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be in the papers,\" he said, more to himself than to me. He looked up. \"No, I just can\u0027t. We\u0027re trying to keep it quiet as long as we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had done this on purpose, I figured, to punish me for my lack of interest in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" said Arthur, his hard blue eyes fixed on my face, \"if you were to butter up the lead detective sufficiently ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Define \u0027butter up,\u0027\" I said, my voice tart. I hoped he didn\u0027t mean what I thought he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cup of that coffee would be nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flushed, and poured him the coffee. It smelled so good, I decided I\u0027d have more, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t open your paper this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I save the big Sunday paper for the afternoons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur slipped off the rubber band and unrolled the paper. Celia\u0027s murder was the below-the-fold story on the front page. I blinked at the amount of coverage. The picture of Celia was one taken at the Emmys, when she\u0027d been hanging on Robin\u0027s arm. She looked fabulous, and very young. Robin looked awfully mature, compared to Celia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motioned at a chair at the table, and Arthur sat. I slid into the chair across from him and began reading. The more I read the hotter my cheeks got. There were several references to the age difference between Robin and Celia. There were several references to Barrett. You didn\u0027t have to be Miss Marple to read between the lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d finished, I couldn\u0027t look up at Arthur. This time it was I who didn\u0027t want him to read my face. I was wondering who was responsible for the slant of the story. Was it this individual reporter? Was this the way Arthur had read the situation, and had the facts he\u0027d released to the papers been selected because they followed Arthur\u0027s reading? Or had this reporter been talking to Barrett?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was willing to bet on some combination of all these elements. There were details about the evening at Heavenly Barbecue that had \"Barrett\" stamped all over them, especially the inclusion of my name. It could easily have been left out of the story, and my presence at that awful meal clearly had no bearing on Celia\u0027s death - or at least, none that I could fathom. Barrett wanted to cause me discomfort and inconvenience, and he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang while I was thinking, and before I could answer it, Arthur picked it up. I felt rage prickle at the backs of my eyes while I waited for him to hand over my own telephone to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, she\u0027s right here,\" Arthur was saying, and as he gave me the receiver he got a good look at my face. I don\u0027t think he\u0027d quite realized that he was upsetting me, but he sure knew now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roe?\" It was Robin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you... are you too busy to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound kind of funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in a mood,\" I said, with self-control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I can tell. With me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you read the paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It was just brought to my attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you... are we still on for tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" He sounded flatteringly relieved. \"This may be hard to arrange, because I\u0027m besieged here at the motel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think. I\u0027ll call you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me his room number, which he\u0027d forgotten to do at the church, and I said good-bye. I hung up and swung around to face Arthur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t answer the telephone in my home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize. I was out of line. It was a reflex. I should have thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, I need you to go. I have things I have to do this afternoon.\" I wondered what I would do if Arthur wouldn\u0027t leave, but I pushed that thought down into a corner as hard as I could. It wouldn\u0027t do to sound the least uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry to have bothered you.\" Now he was getting all stiff and huffy. Screw it. No more Ms. Nice Widow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, unrelenting, until he stuffed his pad back into his pocket and stomped out. I set the alarm behind him. I watched from the window as he drove away. Again, I felt the isolation of this house. It was definitely time to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered, as I turned away from the window, what big secret he had been going to tell me. I was proud of myself for not softening, but at the same time it was irritating to be left hanging that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Robin and I had eventually arranged, I picked up a key at the desk and then pulled around to the back of the motel about two hours before my mother\u0027s dinner. We\u0027d allowed plenty of time in case something went wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough they weren\u0027t in the front, where the office was, there were lots of reporters camped out in the side parking lot of the motel, and some television news vans. It had been easy for them to find out where the movie crew was staying. The men and women of the media were milling around on the pavement. Some of them had brought deck chairs, and some of them were playing cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I would not make a living as a reporter for any amount of money. No one could pay me enough to sit in a motel parking lot just in case someone should stick his head out of a door long enough to be photographed or interviewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still had my hair up and I was wearing dark glasses, a rudimentary camouflage move. I scooted up the stairs to a room on the second floor, not even glancing out over the railing to see if I was being observed. I had noticed Shelby\u0027s car parked two slots down, and that was one big relief. Shelby had rented the room I\u0027d just entered under his own name, and left the key at the desk for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called up to Robin\u0027s room. Shelby answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s ready,\" Shelby said when he recognized my voice. He sounded amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. The door\u0027s unlocked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelby hung up; he was a man of few words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn less than two minutes, the door swung open, and Robin walked in dressed in Shelby\u0027s blue padded Pan-Am Agra winter jumpsuit. It was what the men out in the plant wore when the temperatures dropped. Shelby was not as tall as Robin, but he was wider, and the poor fit was not so noticeable. The day was just barely cool enough to make the heavy garment reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I take it off, now?\" Robin asked. \"It\u0027s cutting me in a, uh, tender area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, take it off till it\u0027s time for us to leave,\" I said, trying not to smile too broadly. I hadn\u0027t figured that Shelby\u0027s suit would be too short in the crotch for a long man like Robin. I perched on the end of the bed to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that smile,\" Robin said, his voice muffled by his attempts to take off the jumpsuit while he faced away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nice clothes were somewhat rumpled by the experience, and his hair was disheveled, but he emerged from the heavy jumpsuit looking relieved. \"I\u0027ll put it back on before we go. You\u0027re sure your friend doesn\u0027t mind doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as long as he gets his jumpsuit back. I owe them two hours babysitting now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t seem too bad. I\u0027ll help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be around,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll be back in Hollywood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat beside me on the end of the bed, and what you might call a significant silence fell. I was scared to look up at him, but eventually I just had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t ask him what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t say it was totally unexpected, but it was still a sort of shock. I hadn\u0027t kissed anyone since Martin died. And I hadn\u0027t kissed Robin, of course, in many years. But there was a familiarity to it, a kind of renewal, instead of the shock of something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe because we were in a motel room, and I didn\u0027t have anything of my former life around me, maybe because I had that pleasant zingy feeling that I\u0027d put one over on a lot of people with my plan to sneak Robin out for an innocent dinner at my mother\u0027s, maybe just because I hadn\u0027t had sex in a hell of a long time, but I went up in flames. It was all I could to keep from grabbing him and throwing him to the bed. This was not my usual style. I was trembling with the effort of suppressing my reaction to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roe?\" he said, almost whispering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had put his hands on either side of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little more,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we a little mature to be making out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to go sit on that chair over there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s lie down as our next step,\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" I scooted up on the bed after kicking off my shoes, and Robin did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lot easier to kiss you when we\u0027re lying down,\" he observed, after a minute or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had noticed that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do that some more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we did. It was like being teenagers again. We were thoroughly frustrated when I called a halt to the proceedings. But I just couldn\u0027t take that step. I just wasn\u0027t quite ready. Though God knows, my body was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin vanished into the bathroom, and reappeared a few minutes later, looking more relaxed. He wedged back into the jumpsuit. My blouse was buttoned and tucked, and I\u0027d put on my shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your mother just as formidable as she was a few years ago?\" he asked, watching me brush my hair, which I\u0027d taken down. With a little help. I carefully pinned it in a knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s softer around the edges. Marriage and having grandchildren by way of John\u0027s kids has really fulfilled her.\" I was still enjoying the pleasant sense of having been naughty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remind me to take you to a motel room more often,\" Robin said as we trotted down the stairs and scrambled into my car. No one called out to us. The jumpsuit and the hairstyle evidently were enough camouflage. \"If we\u0027d stayed a little longer, maybe I could have had my wicked way with you.\" He had jammed a baseball cap over his telltale red hair, and I turned my face away to hide my smile. Every man I knew wore a cap at some time or another and looked quite natural, but not Robin. He looked like an ostrich dressed up for Halloween. I was relieved when he pulled it off when we got into downtown Lawrenceton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene at my mother\u0027s house was chaotic. John\u0027s two sons and their wives and their children made the two-story four-bedroom seem positively tight. I had always liked John: warming up to his sons Avery and John David had taken a little longer. They\u0027d been a little wary of my mother and me, too. The fact that John and my mother had signed a prenuptial agreement that was very clear on who got what when they passed away had been a great help, and my mother\u0027s cordiality and courtesy had won over her new stepdaughters-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelinda, Avery\u0027s wife, was braiding her toddler\u0027s hair in the foyer when I stepped in. Her infant, Charles, was in one of those portable carriers, which was on the floor where she could keep an eye on him. Charles was awake and watching his mother and sister with wide eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold still, Marcy!\" Melinda was saying, her temper obviously at the breaking point. Marcy, of course, picked the entrance of a stranger (Robin) to spring into her worst behavior. \"No!\" she shrieked. \"It hurts! Daddy do it! Daddy do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, your daddy\u0027s busy. I\u0027m going to braid your hair,\" Melinda said firmly. My respect for her mounted. I would have gone searching for Daddy instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melinda, this is my friend Robin,\" I said, when Melinda\u0027s hands had begun dividing Marcy\u0027s fine brown hair into three parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Robin! I\u0027d shake your hand, but I\u0027m busy right now. I think your mom is in the den, Roe.\" Melinda\u0027s fingers flew, braiding like hell while Marcy was standing still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Aunt Roe,\" Marcy said, looking up at us. She eyed Robin. He must have seemed huge to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe located my mother in the den, as Melinda had said. She was serving glasses of wine, but she put the tray down so Robin could give her a small hug (nicely calibrated on Robin\u0027s part). Then there was a round of handshaking among the men. John had recovered from his heart attack, but he was thinner and didn\u0027t move as quickly as before. He was still a handsome man, and he\u0027d passed his looks to Avery and John David, tall brown-haired men with blue eyes. They were golfers like John, and they were both confident men who did well at their chosen careers. Other than those similarities, they were quite different, and their wives weren\u0027t anything like each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery, Melinda\u0027s husband, was an accountant. Avery was very traditional, and people who weren\u0027t also completely buttoned down were somewhat suspect in his book. He\u0027d never been really sure about me. Melinda herself, though pleasant, was none too bright. But she seemed to have this raising kids thing down pat, and she was active in community work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn David, the younger brother, had been a wild child. There was still a gleam in his eyes that said he was anticipating the unexpected. His wife, Poppy, had also made a name for herself as a teenager, but now she seemed quite settled into her role as a suburban wife and mother. She still enjoyed an evening out every now and then, and I would not have put money on either of them maintaining fidelity during their marriage, but I liked both of them quite a bit. Their new son, Brandon Chase Queensland, was the most placid baby I had ever encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I might have predicted, Avery questioned Robin cautiously about his means of making a living, his future plans, and his upbringing. John David wanted to hear stories of the famous people Robin knew, and instantly treated Robin as if he was my acknowledged companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too surprising, since you have a hickey on your neck,\" my mother murmured into my ear, and I jumped a mile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell,\" I said, clapping a hand over the spot she touched with one cool finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone\u0027s already seen it,\" she said with a shrug. \"You and Robin seem to have picked up where you left off.\" My mother\u0027s graying brown hair was beautifully styled, as always, and her tailored blouse and gray slacks were as informal as she got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her arm and we stepped into the dining room, which so far was empty of Queenslands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only thing is,\" I said, with the frankness you can only show your family, \"I think about Martin and I just feel so guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother took a deep breath. Her eyes looked old, suddenly. \"You listen to me right now, Roe. Your husband is beyond all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin - yes, while he was here he truly loved you - but Martin has passed beyond those emotions that plague living people - jealousy, possessiveness, selfishness. He\u0027s not here, he doesn\u0027t worry about worldly things any more, and he should not affect your decisions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent - mostly from the shock of her frankness -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as I pondered my mother\u0027s pronouncements. \"You\u0027re sure you believe this,\" I said, half-asking a question. \"Because you know... Martin, as he was, would rather have killed Robin, and maybe me, too... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that wasn\u0027t Martin\u0027s best side,\" my mother said calmly. \"But these things are no longer his concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat idea caused a painful ache. It detached my life even further from Martin\u0027s. And yet, I could not deny that I felt a lightening of my heart, as if the fact that it was still emotionally tied to Martin\u0027s had been dragging it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the best mother I\u0027ve ever had,\" I said, and my voice came out shaky. She laughed, and I laughed, and I gave her a hug, and then she went back to her company. \"Melinda, have you got that girl\u0027s hair braided?\" I heard her asking as she went into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mumble from Melinda, then Marcy\u0027s voice, shrill and piercing, \"Is that big man with Aunt Roe a giant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole house seemed to hold its breath for a second before laughter came from at least three different rooms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-scene-alive-aurora-teagarden-7/page-8.html","bookId":2242,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:17 PM"}
