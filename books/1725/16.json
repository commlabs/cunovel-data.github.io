It was unprecedented, even inconceivable, that she had felt frustrated for hours now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander of the spaceport was Captain Racety all over again. He was polite, almost obsequious, looked unhappy, expressed his regrets, denied the least willingness to contradict her, and stood like iron against her plainly stated wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finally forced from stating her desires to demanding her rights as though she were a common Sarkite. She said, \"I suppose that as a citizen I have the right to meet any incoming vessel if I wish.\" -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was poisonous about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander cleared his throat and the expression of pain on his lined face grew, if anything, clearer and more definite. Finally he said, \"As a matter of fact, my Lady, we have no wish at all to exclude you. It is only that we have received specific orders from the Squire, your father, to forbid your meeting the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said frozenly, \"Are you ordering me to leave the port, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my Lady.\" The commauder was glad to compromise. \"We were not ordered to exclude you from the port. If you wish to remain here you may do so. But, with all due respect, we will have to stop you from approaching closer to the pits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone and Samia sat in the futile luxury of her private ground-car, a hundred feet inside the outermost entrance of the port. They had been waiting and watching for her. They would probably keep on watching her. If she as much as rolled a wheel onward, she thought indignantly, they would probably cut her power-drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gritted her teeth. It was unfair of her father to do this. It was all of a piece. They always treated her as though she understood nothing. Yet she had thought he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had risen from his seat to greet her, a thing he never did for anyone else now that Mother was dead. He had clasped her, squeezed her tightly, abandoned all his work for her. He had even sent his secretary out of the room because he knew she was repelled by the native\u0027s still, white countenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost like the old days before Grandfather died when Father had not yet become Great Squire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Mia, child, I\u0027ve counted the hours. I never knew it was such a long way from Florina. When I heard that those natives had hidden on your ship, the one I had sent just to insure your safety, I was nearly wild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy! There was nothing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t there? I almost sent out the entire fleet to take you off and bring you in with full military security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed together at the thought. Minutes passed before Samia could bring the conversation back to the subject that filled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said casually, \"What are you going to do with the stowaways, Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want to know, Mia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think they\u0027ve plans to assassinate you, or anything like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFife smiled. \"You shouldn\u0027t think morbid thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think so, do you?\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good! Because I\u0027ve talked to them, Dad, and I just don\u0027t believe they\u0027re anything more than poor harmless people. I don\u0027t care what Captain Racety says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve broken a considerable number of laws for \u0027poor harmless people,\u0027 Mia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t treat them as common criminals, Dad.\" Her voice rose in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man isn\u0027t a native. He\u0027s from a planet called Earth and he\u0027s been psycho-probed and he\u0027s not responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, dear, Depsec will realize that. Suppose you leave it to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s too important to just leave to them. They won\u0027t understand. Nobody understands. Except me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only you in the whole world, Mia?\" he - asked indulgently, and put out a finger to stroke a lock of hair that had fallen over her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said with energy, \"Only I! Only I! Everyone else is going to think he\u0027s crazy, but I\u0027m sure he isn\u0027t. He says there is some great danger to Florina and to all the Galaxy. He\u0027s a Spatio-analyst and you know they specialize in cosmogony. He would knowr\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know he\u0027s a Spatio-analyst, Mia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are the details of the danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t know. He\u0027s been psycho-probed. Don\u0027t you see that that\u0027s the best evidence of all? He knew too much. Someone was interested in keeping it dark.\" Her voice instinctively fell and grew huskily confidential. She restrained an impulse to look over her shoulder. She said, \"If his theories were false, don\u0027t you see, there wouldn\u0027t have been any need to psycho-probe him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t they kill him, if that\u0027s the case?\" asked Fife and instantly regretted the question. There was no use in teasing the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia thought awhile, fruitlessly, then said, \"If you\u0027ll order Depsec to let me speak to him, I\u0027ll find out. He trusts me. I know he does. I\u0027ll get more out of him than Depsec can. Please tell Depsec to let me see him, Dad. It\u0027s very important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFife squeezed her clenched fists gently and smiled at her. \"Not yet, Mia. Not yet. In a few hours we\u0027ll have the third person in our hands. After that, perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The third person? The native who did all the killings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. The ship carrying him will land in about an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you won\u0027t do anything with the native girl and the Spatio-analyst till then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good! I\u0027ll meet the ship.\" She rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going, Mia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the port, Father. I have a great deal to ask of this other native.\" She laughed. \"I\u0027ll show you that your daughter can be quite a detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fife did not respond to her laughter. He said, \"I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s essential that there be nothing out of the way about this man\u0027s arrival. You\u0027d be too conspicuous at the port.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t explain statecraft to you, Mia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Statecraft, pooh.\" She leaned toward him, pecked a quick kiss at the center of his forehead and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she sat helplessly car-bound in the port while far overhead there was a growing speck in the sky, dark against the brightness of the late afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed the button that opened the utility compartment and took out her polo-glasses. Ordinarily they were used to follow the gyrating antics of the one-man speedsters which took part in stratospheric polo. They could be put to more serious use too. She put them to her eyes and the descending dot became a ship in miniature, the ruddy glow of its stern drive plainly visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would at least see the men as they left, learn as much as she could by the one sense of sight, arrange an interview somehow, somehow thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSark filled the visiplate. A continent and half an ocean, obscured in part by the dead cotton-white of clouds, lay below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenro said, his words a trifle uneven as the only indication that the better part of his mind was perforce on the controls before him, \"The spaceport will not be heavily guarded. That was at my suggestion too. I said that any unusual treatment of the arrival of the ship might warn Trantor that something was up. I said that success depended upon Trantor being at no time aware of the true state of affairs until it was too late. Well, never mind that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens shrugged his shoulders glumly. \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenty, to you. I will use the landing pit nearest the East Gate. You will get out the safety exit in the rear as soon as I land. Walk quickly but not too quickly toward that gate. I have some papers that may get you through without trouble and may not. I\u0027ll leave it to you to take necessary action if there is trouble. From past history, I judge I can trust you that far. Outside the gate there will be a car waiting to take you to the embassy. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Sark was changing from a huge featureless sphere of blinding browns and greens and blues and cloud-white into something more alive, into a surface broken by rivers and wrinkled by mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenro\u0027s smile was cool and humorless. \"Your worries may end with yourself. When they find you gone, I may be shot as a traitor. If they find me completely helpless and physically unable to stop you, they may merely demote me as a fool. The latter, I suppose, is preferable, so I will ask you, before you leave, to use a neuronic whip on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Townman said, \"Do you know what a neuronic whip is like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite.\" There were small drops of perspiration at his temples. \"How do you know I won\u0027t kill you afterward? I\u0027m a Squire-killer, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But killing me won\u0027t help you. It will just waste your time. I\u0027ve taken worse chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surface of Sark as viewed in the visiplate was expanding, its edges rushed out past the border of visibility, its center grew and the new edges rushed out in turn. Something like the rainbow of a Sarkite city could be made out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope,\" said Genro, \"you have no ideas of striking out on your own. Sark is no place for that. It\u0027s either Trantor or the Squires. Remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe view was definitely that of a city now and a green-brown patch on its outskirts expanded and became a spaceport below them. It floated up toward them at a slowing pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenro said, \"If Trantor doesn\u0027t have you in the next hour the Squires will have you before the day is out. I don\u0027t guarantee what Trantor will do to you, but I can guarantee what Sark will do to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens had been in the Civil Service. He knew what Sark would do with a Squire-killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe port held steady in the visiplate, but Genro no longer regarded it. He was switching to instruments, riding the pulse-beam downward. The ship turned slowly in air, a mile high, and settled, tail down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred yards above the pit, the engines thundered high. Over the hydraulic springs, Terens could feel their shuddering. He grew giddy in his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenro said, \"Take the whip. Quickly now. Every second is important. The emergency lock will close behind you. It will take them five minutes to wonder why I don\u0027t open the main lock, another five minutes to break in, another five minutes to find you. You have fifteen minutes to get out of the port and into the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shuddering ceased and in the thick silence Terens knew they had made contact with Sark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shifting diamagnetic fields took over. The yacht tipped majestically and slowly moved down upon its side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenro said, \"Now!\" His uniform was wet with perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens, with swimming head, and eyes that all but refused to focus, raised his neuronic whip..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens felt the nip of a Sarkite autumn. He had spent years in its harsh seasons until he had almost forgotten the soft eternal June of Florina. Now his days in Civil Service rushed back upon him as though he had never left this world of Squires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that now he was a fugitive and branded upon him was the ultimate crime, the murder of a Squire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was walking in time to the pounding of his heart. Behind him was the ship and in it was Genro, frozen in the agony of the whip. The lock had closed softly behind him, and he was walking down a broad, paved path. There were workmen and mechanics in plenty about him. Each had his own job and his own troubles. They didn\u0027t stop to stare a man in the face. They had no reason to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad anyone actually seen him emerge from the ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told himself no one had, or by now there would have been the clamor of pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched his hat briefly. It was still down over his ears, and the little medallion it now carried was smooth to the touch. Genro had said that it would act as identification. The men from Trantor would be watching for just that medallion, glinting in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could remove it, wander away on his own, find his way to another ship-somehow. He would get away from Sark- somehow. He would escape-somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many somehows! In his heart he knew he had come to the final end, and as Genro had said, it was either Trantor or Sark. He hated and feared Trantor, but he knew that in any choice it could not and must not be Sark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You! You there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens froze. He looked up in cold panic. The gate was a hundred feet away. If he ran... But they wouldn\u0027t allow a running man to get out. It was a thing he dared not do. He must not run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman was looking out the open window of a car such as Terens had never seen, not even during fifteen years on Sark. It gleamed with metal and sparkled with translucent gem mite. -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens\u0027 legs carried him slowly to the car. Genro had said Trantor\u0027s car would be waiting outside the port. Or had he? And would they send a woman on such an errand? A girl, in fact. A girl with a dark, beautiful face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"You arrived on the ship that just landed, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe became impatient. \"Come, I saw you leave the ship!\" She tapped her polo-glasses. He had seen such glasses before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens mumbled, \"Yes. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held the door open for him. The car was even more luxurious inside. The seat was soft and it all smelled new and fragrant and the girl was beautiful. -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Are you a member of the crew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was testing him, Terens imagined. He said, \"You know who I am.\" He raised his fingers momentarily to the medallion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any sound of motive power the car backed and turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the gate Terens shrank back into the soft, cool, kyrtcovered upholstery, but there was no need for caution. The girl spoke peremptorily and they passed through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"This man is with me. I am Samia of Fife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took seconds for the tired Terens to hear and understand that. When he lurched tensely forward in his seat the car was traveling along the express lanes at a hundred per.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA laborer within the port looked up from where he stood and muttered briefly into his lapel. He entered the building then and returned to his work. His superintendent frowned and made a mental note to talk to Tip about this habit of lingering outside to smoke cigarettes for half an hour at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the port one of two men in a ground-car said with annoyance, \"Got into a car with a girl? What car? What girl?\" For all his Sarkite costume, his accent belonged definitely to the Arcturian worlds of the Trantorian Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis companion was a Sarkite, well versed in the visicast news releases. When the car in question rolled through the gate and picked up speed as it began to veer off and upward to the express level, he half rose in his seat and cried, \"It\u0027s the Lady Samia\u0027s car. There isn\u0027t another like it. Good Galaxy, what do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow,\" said the other briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the Lady Samia-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s nothing to me. She shouldn\u0027t be anything to you either. Or what are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir own car was making the turn, climbing upward onto the broad, nearly empty stretches on which only the speediest of ground travel was permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite groaned, \"We can\u0027t catch that car. As soon as she spots us she\u0027ll kick out resistance. That car can make two-fifty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s staying at a hundred so far,\" said the Arcturian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while he said, \"She\u0027s not going to Depsec. That\u0027s for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after another while he said, \"She\u0027s not going to the Palace of Fife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill another interval and he said, \"I\u0027ll be spun in space if I know where she\u0027s going. She\u0027ll be leaving the city again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite said, \"How do we know it\u0027s the Squire-killer that\u0027s in there? Suppose it\u0027s a game to get us away from the post. She\u0027s not trying to shake us and she wouldn\u0027t use a car like that if she didn\u0027t want to be followed. You can\u0027t miss it at two miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but Fife wouldn\u0027t send his girl to get us out of the way. A squad of patrollers would have done the job better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it isn\u0027t really the Lady in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to find out, man. She\u0027s slowing. Flash past and stop around a curve!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to speak to you,\" said the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens decided it was not the ordinary kind of trap he had first considered it. She was the Lady of Fife. She must be. It did not seem to occur to her that anyone could or ought to interfere with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never looked back to see if she were followed. Three times as they turned he had noted the same car to the rear, keeping its distance, neither closing the gap nor falling behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not just a car. That was certain. It might be Trantor, which would be well. It might be Sark, in which case the Lady would be a decent sort of hostage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027m ready to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"You were on the ship that brought the native from Florina? The one wanted for all those killings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. Now I\u0027ve brought you out here so that there\u0027ll be no interference. Was the native questioned during the trip to Sark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch naIvet��, Terens thought, could not be assumed. She really did not know who he was. He said guardedly, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you present at the questioning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I thought so. Why did you leave the ship, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, thought Terens, was the question she should have asked first of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I was to bring a special report to-\" He hesitated. She seized on the hesitation eagerly. \"To my father? Don\u0027t worry about that. I\u0027ll protect you completely. I\u0027ll say you came with me at my orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Very well, my Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words \"my Lady\" struck deeply into his own consciousness. She was a Lady, the greatest in the land, and he was a Florinian. A man who could kill patrollers could learn easily how to kill Squires, and a Squire-killer might, by the same token, look a Lady in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, his eyes hard and searching. He lifted his head and stared down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because she was the greatest Lady in the land, she was unconscious of his regard. She said, \"I want you to tell me everything that you heard at the questioning. I want to know all that was told to you by the native. It\u0027s very important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask why you are interested in the native, my Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may not,\" she said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish, my Lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what he was going to say. With half his consciousness he was waiting for the pursuing car to catch up. With the other half he was growing more aware of the face and body of the beautiful girl sitting near him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorinians in the Civil Service and those acting as Townmen were, theoretically, celibates. In actual practice, most evaded that restriction when they could. Terens had done what he dared and what was expedient in that direction. At best, his experiences had never been satisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was all the more important that he had never been so near a beautiful girl in a car of such luxuriance under conditions of such isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was waiting for him to speak, dark eyes (such dark eyes) aflame with interest, full red lips parted in anticipation, a figure more beautiful for being set off in beautiful kyrt. She was completely unaware that anyone, anyone, could possibly dare harbor dangerous thought with regard to the Lady of Fife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half of his consciousness that waited for the pursuers faded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly knew that the killing of a Squire was not the ultimate crime after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t quite aware that he moved. He knew only that her small body was in his arms, that it stiffened, that for an instant she cried out, and then he smothered the cry with his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were hands on his shoulder and the drift of cool air on his back through the opened door of the car. His fingers groped for his weapon, too late. It was ripped from his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia gasped wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite said with horror, \"Did you see what he did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arcturian said, \"Never mind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a small black object into his pocket and smoothed the seam shut. \"Get him,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite dragged Terens out of the car with the energy of fury. \"And she let him,\" he muttered. \"She let him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" cried Samia with sudden energy. \"Did my f ather send you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arcturian said, \"No questions, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a foreigner,\" said Samia angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite said, \"By Sark, I ought to bust his head in.\" He cocked his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" said the Arcturian. He seized the Sarkite\u0027s wrist and forced it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite growled sullenly, \"There are limits. I can take the Squire-killing. I\u0027d like to kill a few myself, but standing by and watching a native do what he did is just about too much for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia said in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, \"Native?\" The Sarkite leaned forward, snatched viciously at Terens\u0027 cap. The Townman paled but did not move. He kept his gaze steadily upon the girl and his sandy hair moved slightly in the breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamia moved helplessly back along the car seat as far as she could and then, with a quick movement, she covered her face with both hands, her skin turning white under the pressure of her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarkite said, \"What are we going to do with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She saw us; She\u0027ll have the whole planet after us before we\u0027ve gone a mile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to kill the Lady of Fife?\" asked the Arcturian sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no. But we can wreck her car. By the time she gets to a radio-phone, we\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not necessary.\" The Arcturian leaned into the car. \"My Lady, I have only a moment. Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arcturian said, \"You had better hear me. I am sorry I interrupted you at a tender moment but luckily I have put that moment to use. I acted quickly and was able to record the scene by tri-camera. This is no bluff. I will transmit the negative to a safe place minutes after I leave you and thereafter any interference on your part will force me to be rather nasty. I\u0027m sure you understand me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away. \"She won\u0027t say anything about this. Not a thing. Come along with me, Townman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerens followed. He could not look back at the white, pinched face in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever might now follow, he had accomplished a miracle. For one moment he had kissed the proudest Lady on Sark, had felt the fleeting touch of her soft, fragrant lips. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-currents-of-space-galactic-empire-2/page-16.html","bookId":1725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:48 AM"}
