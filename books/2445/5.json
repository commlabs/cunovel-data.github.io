{"id":79588,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eI WAS in a cell no more than four metres by four, with a ceding maybe three metres high. There were no windows - apart from a small one set in the door - and no two-way mirrors. There were two surveillance cameras in the corners above the door, a long table with a tape recorder on it, three chairs, me - and three grim-looking police officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the officers was standing by the door, a rifle cradled tightly across his chest, eyes sharp. He hadn\u0027t told me his name - he hadn\u0027t spoken a word - but I could read it from his badge: William McKay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two weren\u0027t wearing badges, but had told me their names: Con and Ivan. Con was tall, dark-faced and very lean, with a gruff manner and ready sneer. Ivan was older and thinner, with grey hair. He looked tired and spoke softly, as though the questions were exhausting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Darren Shan your real name, like we\u0027ve been told?\" Ivan enquired for about the twentieth time since I\u0027d been admitted to the holding cell. They\u0027d been asking the same questions over and over, and showed no signs of letting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. So far I hadn\u0027t said anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or is it Darren Horston - the name you\u0027ve been using recently?\" Ivan asked after a few seconds of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about your travelling companion - Larten Crepsley or Vur Horston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my hands, which were handcuffed, and said nothing. I examined the chain linking the handcuffs: steel, short, thick. I thought I\u0027d be able to snap it if I had to, but I wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ankles were cuffed as well. The chain linking my ankles had been short when I was arrested. The police left the short chain on while I was being fingerprinted and photographed, but took it off and replaced it with a longer chain soon after they locked me away securely in the cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the freak?\" the officer called Con asked. \"That grey-skinned monster. What\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t a monster!\" I snapped, breaking my code of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Con sneered. \"What is he then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe me if I told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try us,\" Ivan encouraged me, but I only shook my head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the other two?\" Con asked. \"Vancha March and Larten Crepsley. Our informants told us they were vampires. What do you have to say about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled humourlessly. \"Vampires don\u0027t exist,\" I said. \"Everyone knows that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Ivan said. \"They don\u0027t.\" He leant across the table, as though to tell me a secret. \"But those two aren\u0027t entirely normal, Darren, as I\u0027m sure you already know. March disappeared like a magician, while Crepsley ?\" He coughed. \"Well, we haven\u0027t been able to photograph him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled when he said that, and looked up at the video cameras. Full-vampires have peculiar atoms, which make it impossible for them to be captured on film. The police could take snaps of Mr Crepsley from every angle they could dream of, with the best cameras available - to no visible effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at the grin on him!\" Con snapped. \"He thinks this is funny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, wiping the smile from my face. \"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you laughing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I was thinking of something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan slumped back in his chair, disappointed by my answers. \"We\u0027ve taken a blood sample from Crepsley,\" he said. \"From the thing called Harkat Mulds too. We\u0027ll find out what they are when the results come back. It would be to your advantage to tell us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t reply. Ivan waited a moment, then ran a hand through his grey hair. He sighed despondently, and began with the questions again. \"What\u0027s your real name? What\u0027s your relationship to the others? Where ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore time passed. I wasn\u0027t able to judge exactly how long I\u0027d been imprisoned. It felt like a day or more, but realistically it was probably only four or five hours, maybe less. The sun was most likely still shining outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Mr Crepsley and wondered how he was faring. If he was in a cell like mine, he\u0027d nothing to worry about. But if they\u0027d put him in a cell with windows ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are my friends?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCon and Ivan had been discussing something under their breath. Now they looked at me, expressions guarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d like to see them?\" Ivan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to know where they are,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you answer our questions, a meeting can be arranged,\" Ivan promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to know where they are,\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re close,\" Con grunted. \"Locked away nice and tight like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In cells like this?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly the same,\" Con said, then looked around at the walls and smiled as he realized why I was concerned. \"Cells without windows,\" he chuckled, then nudged his partner in the ribs. \"But that can be changed, can\u0027t it, Ivan? What say we move the \u0027vampire\u0027 to a cell with lovely round windows? A cell with a view of the outside - the sky - thesun .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing, but locked gazes with Con and stared back angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like the sound of that, do you?\" Con hissed. \"The thought of us sticking Crepsley in a room with windows terrifies you, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged indifferently and averted my eyes. \"I want to speak to a lawyer,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCon burst out laughing. Ivan hid a smile behind a hand. Even the guard with the rifle smirked, as though I\u0027d cracked the best joke ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny?\" I snapped. \"I know my rights. I\u0027m entitled to a phonecall and a lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Con crowed. \"Even killers have rights.\" He rapped the table with his knuckles, then turned off the tape recorder. \"But guess what - we\u0027re withholding those rights. We\u0027ll catch hell for it later, but we don\u0027t care. We\u0027ve got you walled up here and we won\u0027t let you take advantage of your rights until you give with some answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s illegal,\" I growled. \"You can\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Normally, no,\" he agreed. \"Normally our Chief Inspector would barge in and kick up a storm if she heard about something like this. But our Chief isn\u0027t here, is she? She\u0027s been abducted by your fellow killer, Vancha March.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went white-lipped when I heard that and realized what it meant. With their Chief out of the way, they\u0027d taken the law into their own hands, and were prepared to do whatever it took to find out where she was and get her back. It might cost their them careers, but they didn\u0027t care. This was personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to torture me to make me talk,\" I said stiffly, testing them to see how far they were willing to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Torture\u0027s not our way,\" Ivan said immediately. \"We don\u0027t do things like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unlike some people we could mention,\" Con added, then tossed a photo across the table at me. I tried to ignore it, but my eyes flicked automatically to the figure in it. I saw that it was the vampet we\u0027d taken hostage earlier that morning in the tunnels, the one called Mark Ryter - the one Vancha had tortured and killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not evil,\" I said quietly. But I could see things from their point of view and understood how monstrous we must look. \"There are sides to this you don\u0027t know about. We\u0027re not the killers you seek. We\u0027re trying to stop them, the same as you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCon barked a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" I insisted. \"Mark Ryter was one of the bad guys. We had to hurt him to find out about the others. We\u0027re not your enemies. You and I are on the same side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the weakest lie I\u0027ve ever heard,\" Con snapped. \"How dumb do you think we are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re dumb at all,\" I said. \"But you\u0027re misguided. You\u0027ve been tricked. You ?\" I leant forward eagerly. \"Who told you where to find us? Who told you our names, that we were vampires, that we were your killers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policemen shared an uneasy glance, then Ivan said, \"It was an anonymous tip-off. The caller rang from a public phone booth, left no name, and was gone when we arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t that sound fishy to you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We receive anonymous tips all the time,\" Ivan said, but he looked fidgety and I knew he had his doubts. If he\u0027d been alone, maybe I could have talked him round to my way of thinking, and persuaded him to grant me the benefit of the doubt. But before I could say anything more, Con tossed another photo across the table at me, then another. Close-ups of Mark Ryter, capturing even more of the grisly details than the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People onour side don\u0027t kill other people,\" he said coldly. \"Even when they\u0027d like to,\" he added meaningfully, pointing a finger at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and let it drop, knowing I couldn\u0027t convince them of my innocence. A few seconds of silence passed, while they settled down after the exchange and composed themselves. Then they switched the tape recorder on and the questions started again. Who was I? Where had I come from? Where did Vancha March go? How many people had we killed? On and on and on and ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police were getting nowhere with me, and it was frustrating them. Ivan and Con had been joined by another officer called Morgan, who had pinpoint eyes and dark brown hair. He sat stiff-backed, his hands flat on the table, subjecting me to a cool, unbreaking gaze. I had the feeling that Morgan was here to get nasty, although so far he\u0027d made no violent moves against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\" Con was asking. \"Where are you from? How long have you been here? Why pick this city? How many others have your murdered? Where are the bodies? What have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped at a knock on the door. Turning away, he went to see who was there. Ivan\u0027s eyes followed Con as he went, but Morgan\u0027s stayed on me. He blinked once every four seconds, no more, no less, like a robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCon had a murmured conversation with the person outside the door, then stood back and motioned the guard with the rifle away. The guard sidestepped over to the wall and trained his weapon on me, making sure I wouldn\u0027t try anything funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was expecting another police officer, or maybe a soldier - I hadn\u0027t seen anyone from the army since I\u0027d been arrested - but the meek little man who entered took me by complete surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MrBlaws ?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school inspector who\u0027d forced me to go to Mahler\u0027s looked nervous. He was carrying the same huge briefcase as before, and wearing the same old-fashioned bowler hat. He advanced half a metre, then stopped, reluctant to come any closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for coming, Walter,\" Ivan said, rising to shake the visitor\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Blaws nodded feebly and squeaked, \"Glad to be of assistance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like a chair?\" Ivan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Blaws shook his head quickly. \"No thanks. I\u0027d rather not stop any longer than necessary. Rounds to do. Places to be. You know how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan nodded sympathetically. \"That\u0027s fine. You brought the papers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Blaws nodded. \"The forms he filled in, all the files we have on him. Yes. I left them with a man at the front desk. He\u0027s photocopying them and giving the originals back to me before I leave. I have to hang on to the originals for the school records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Ivan said again, then stepped aside and jerked his head at me. \"Can you identify this boy?\" he asked officiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mr Blaws said. \"He\u0027s Darren Horston. He enrolled with Mahler\u0027s on the ?\" He paused and frowned. \"I\u0027ve forgotten the exact date. I should know it, because I was looking at it on the way in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s OK,\" Ivan smiled. \"We\u0027ll get it from the photocopies. But this is definitely the boy who called himself Darren Horston? You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Blaws nodded firmly. \"Oh yes,\" he said. \"I never forget the face of a pupil, especially one who\u0027s played truant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Walter,\" Ivan said, taking the school inspector\u0027s arm. \"If we need you again, we\u0027ll ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped. Mr Blaws hadn\u0027t moved. He was staring at me with wide eyes and a trembling lip. \"Is it true?\" Mr Blaws asked. \"What the media are saying - he and his friends are the killers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan hesitated. \"We can\u0027t really say right now, but as soon as we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you?\" Mr Blaws shouted at me. \"How could you kill all those people? And poor little Tara Williams - your own classmate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t kill Tara,\" I said tiredly. \"I didn\u0027t kill anybody. I\u0027m not a killer. The police have arrested the wrong people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hah!\" Con snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a beast,\" Mr Blaws growled, raising his briefcase high in the air, as though he meant to throw it at me. \"You should be - you should - should ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t say any more. His lips tightened and his jaw clenched shut. Turning his back on me, he started out of the door. As he was stepping through, I reacted to a childish impulse and called him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr Blaws?\" I shouted. He paused and looked over his shoulder questioningly. I adopted an innocent, dismayed expression. \"This won\u0027t harm my grades, will it, sir?\" I enquired sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school inspector gawped at me, then glared furiously when he realized I was teasing him, turned up his nose, showed me a clean pair of heels and clacked away down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed aloud as Mr Blaws departed, taking absurd comfort in the annoying little man\u0027s irate expression. Con, Ivan and the guard with the gun smiled too, despite themselves, but Morgan didn\u0027t. He remained as steely-faced as ever, a terrible, unspoken menace in his sharp, mechanical eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killers-of-the-dawn-the-saga-of-darren-shan-9/page-5.html","bookId":2445,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM"}
