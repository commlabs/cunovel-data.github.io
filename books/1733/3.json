Then he said, \"Wasn\u0027t that the Secretary\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that was the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Old man Hargrove. Are you ready for lunch? \" \"Of course. What was he doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Jonsbeck didn\u0027t answer immediately. He merely stood up, and beckoned Gelb to follow. They walked down the corridor and into a room that had the steamy smell of spicy food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you are,\" said Jonsbeck. \"The whole meal has been prepared by computer. Completely automated. Untouched by human hands. And my own programming. I promised you a treat, and here you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good. Gelb could not deny it and didn\u0027t want to. Over dessert, he said, \"But what was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHargrove doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonsbeck smiled. \"Consulting me on programming. What else am I good for?\" \"But why? Or is it something you can\u0027t talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something I suppose I shouldn\u0027t talk about, but it\u0027s a fairly open secret. There isn\u0027t a computer man in the capital who doesn\u0027t know what the poor frustrated simp is up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he up to then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s fighting wars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGelb\u0027s eyes opened wide. \"With whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With nobody, really. He fights them by computer analysis. He\u0027s been doing it for I don\u0027t know how long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants the world to be the way we are-noble, honest, decent, full of respect for human rights and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I. So do we all. We have to keep up the pressure on the bad guys, that\u0027s all.\" \"And they\u0027re keeping the pressure on us, too. They don\u0027t think we\u0027re perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose we\u0027re not, but we\u0027re better than they are. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonsbeck shrugged. \" A difference in point of view. It doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027ve got a world to run, space to develop, computerization to extend. Cooperation puts a premium on continued cooperation and there is slow improvement. We\u0027ll get along. It\u0027s just that Hargrove doesn\u0027t want to wait. He hankers for quick improvement-by force. You know, make the bums shape up. We\u0027re strong enough to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By force? By war, you mean. We don\u0027t fight wars any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because it\u0027s gotten too complicated. Too much danger. We\u0027re all too powerful. You know what I mean? Except that Hargrove thinks he can find a way. You punch certain starting conditions into the computer and let it fight the war mathematically and yield the results.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you make equations for war?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you try, old man. Men. Weapons. Surprise. Counterattack. Ships. Space stations. Computers. We mustn\u0027t forget computers. There are a hundred factors and thousands of intensities and millions of combinations. Hargrove thinks it is possible to find some combination of starting conditions and courses of development that will result in clear victory for us and not too much damage to the world, and he labors under constant frustration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if he gets what he wants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if he can find the combination-if the computer says, \u0027This is it,\u0027 then I suppose he thinks he can argue our government into fighting exactly the war the computer has worked out so that, barring random events that upset the indicated course, we\u0027d have what we want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027d be casualties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. But the computer will presumably compare the casualties and other damage-to the economy and ecology, for instance-to the benefits that would derive from our control of the world, and if it decides the benefits will outweigh the casualties, then it will give the go-ahead for a \u0027just war.\u0027 After all, it may be that even the losing nations would benefit from being directed by us, with our stronger economy and stronger moral sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGelb stared his disbelief and said, \"I never knew we were sitting at the lip of a volcanic crater like that. What about the \u0027random events\u0027 you mentioned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The computer program tries to allow for the unexpected, but you never can, of course. So I don\u0027t think the go-ahead will come. It hasn\u0027t so far, and unless old man Hargrove can present the government with a computer simulation of a war that is totally satisfactory, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much chance he can force one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he comes to you, then, for what reason?\" \"To improve the program, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you help him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, certainly. There are big fees involved, Herman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGelb shook his head, \"Peter! Are you going to try to arrange a war, just for money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There won\u0027t be a war. There\u0027s no realistic combination of events that would make the computer decide on war. Computers place a greater value on human lives than human beings do themselves, and what will seem bearable to Secretary Hargrove, or even to you and me, will never be passed by a computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be sure of that? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m a programmer and I don\u0027t know of any way of programming a computer to give it what is most needed to start any war, any persecution, any devilry, while ignoring any harm that may be done in the process. And because it lacks what is most needed, the computers will always give Hargrove, and all others who hanker for war, nothing but frustration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it that a computer doesn\u0027t have, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Gelb. It totally lacks a sense of self-righteousness.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gold-the-final-science-fiction-collection/page-3.html","bookId":1733,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}
