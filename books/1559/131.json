I was worried about you back on the bed there. Your eyes rolled up into your head and everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose I was dying again, so I asked the Lord of Permanent Affection for the strength to live the day. Clearly, the answer came in the affirmative.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know there was such a Fellow,” Buttercup said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither did I, in truth, but if He didn’t exist, I didn’t much want to either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four great horses seemed almost to fly toward Florin Channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It appears to me as if we’re doomed, then,” Buttercup said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley looked at her. “Doomed, madam?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To be together. Until one of us dies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve done that already, and I haven’t the slightest intention of ever doing it again,” Westley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup looked at him. “Don’t we sort of have to sometime?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not if we promise to outlive each other, and I make that promise now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup looked at him. “Oh my Westley, so do I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And they lived happily ever after,’ my father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wow,’ I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. ‘You’re not pleased?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, no, it’s just, it came so quick, the ending, it surprised me. I thought there ‘d be a little more, is all. I mean, was the pirate ship waiting or was that just a rumor like it said?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Complain to Mr. Morgenstern. “And they lived happily ever after” is how it ends.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was, my father was fibbing. I spent my whole life thinking it ended that way, up until I did this abridgement. Then I glanced at the last page. This is how Morgenstern ends it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup looked at him. “Oh my Westley, so do I.” From behind them suddenly, closer than they imagined, they could hear the roar of Humperdinck: “Stop them! Cut them off!” They were, admittedly, startled, but there was no reason for worry: they were on the fastest horses in the kingdom, and the lead was already theirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this was before Inigo’s wound reopened; and Westley relapsed again; and Fezzik took the wrong turn; and Buttercup’s horse threw a shoe. And the night behind them was filled with the crescendoing sound of pursuit…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s Morgenstern’s ending, a ‘Lady or the Tiger?’-type effect (this was before ‘The Lady or the Tiger?,’ remember). Now, he was a satirist, so he left it that way, and my father was, I guess I realized too late, a romantic, so he ended it another way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I’m an abridger, so I’m entitled to a few ideas of my own. Did they make it? Was the pirate ship there? You can answer it for yourself, but, for me, I say yes it was. And yes, they got away. And got their strength back and had lots of adventures and more than their share of laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that doesn’t mean I think they had a happy ending either. Because, in my opinion anyway, they squabbled a lot, and Buttercup lost her looks eventually, and one day Fezzik lost a fight and some hot-shot kid whipped Inigo with a sword and Westley was never able to really sleep sound because of Humperdinck maybe being on the trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not trying to make this a downer, understand. I mean, I really do think that love is the best thing in the world, except for cough drops. But I also have to say, for the umpty-umpth time, that life isn’t fair. It’s just fairer than death, that’s all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-131.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
