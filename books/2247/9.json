How about this Friday night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrunched her face, tapped her face with a thin finger. \"I don\u0027t think so, Jay. I like you. Really. But I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be good for me. I can\u0027t start living big overnight, and I don\u0027t think a week of sit-ups is going to change you. I think we better try being friends for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" He felt a sulk coming on and didn\u0027t try to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But listen, I meant what I said about Ellis.

I\u0027m not going to be a professor at some backwater diploma mill. I\u0027m going to find out about this Ellis kid, and I\u0027ll do it alone if I have to.\" She slid out of the booth, dropped a twenty on the table. \"That should cover my part of lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t quite storm out, but she didn\u0027t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to see any more rodents,\" Morgan said. \"You understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Lancaster looked sheepish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No rats, no mice, no hamsters, no kind of furry animals at all, okay? I don\u0027t want to read any more poems in which furry animals are symbolic of anything at all. You get me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster gulped. \"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even want to see little animals symbolize themselves. I don\u0027t want to even see a person in your poem wearing fuzzy bedroom slippers that are even remotely reminiscent of anything animal-like at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster went red at the ears. He couldn\u0027t look at the rest of the class, head down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan had to come down on the kid hard. Sometimes these students got stuck in a rut and it just got worse and worse until somebody gave them a slap. \"I hope I\u0027ve been clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to read a poem about people. They can be fucking or making soup or driving tractors or buying baseball cards on eBay or chewing tobacco or anything you damn well want. But I want people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster said nothing, didn\u0027t budge. He\u0027d been thoroughly squashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Morgan shuffled his stack of papers to the last poem of the day. Hell. It was the Ellis kid\u0027s turn. Morgan had been dreading this. He looked at his watch. Maybe he could claim they were out of time, put off Ellis\u0027s poem until next class. No good. Still fifteen minutes left. Nothing to do but forge ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sherman, read us your poem please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis actually stood. This was different. Morgan wondered for a second if Ellis was actually about to leave, run out of the class instead of read his poem. Morgan had seen it happen before. But Ellis wasn\u0027t going anywhere. He had a fierce look in his eyes, chest puffed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis waved his fist in the air, slapped his chest with the other hand. \"Okay, y\u0027all, this is Sherman E in the house. I\u0027m gonna need some help with this one. Everybody say YEAH!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody froze. The students looked at Morgan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the poem:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was cruising the hood in my red Mercedes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekeeping it real with my homies and my ladies,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody can touch my crew because all them cats are fraidies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThem St. Louis niggers ain\u0027t got no class,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwitching on the crack bust a cap in my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis recited his poem like he was angry, slapping his desk with the rhythm, saliva flying from his mouth, eyes white and wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rocking and shaken and frying up some bacon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut if they think they know Sherman E then they sadly mistaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGonna POP that COP\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCocksucker motherfucker never make me STOP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBleed the bitch out now shout now shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point Ellis grabbed his own balls, hopped up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn your knees on your knees, show you what it\u0027s \u0027bout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll pull you a stunt, smoke my blunt Sherman E don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake shit from some cunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis looked at Morgan, waited for commentary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe class sat in dead quiet. Dumbstruck. Morgan went pale, his lips squeezed tight and bloodred like wet paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda paled, hugged herself in her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrible. Morgan shook his head. What the hell am I supposed to do with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster tugged at his collar. \"Well...\" He looked at his copy of the poem, made useless scratches with his pen. \"Well, yes. Okay then. I think it\u0027s very brave of Sherman to embrace certain clich¨¦s and stereotypes in an attempt to... uh... explore the dangers of...\" He shook his head. \"Look, I don\u0027t really know what Sherman was trying to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego\u0027s mouth hung open. \"Jesus.\" He barked a hard laugh. \"I mean... Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan shuffled the stack of poems, stood slowly. He turned, walked out the door. The students waited a minute, looked at one another, but their professor didn\u0027t come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny waited on Morgan\u0027s porch. She was there smiling coyly when he arrived home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze when he saw her, looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d call me,\" Ginny said. That\u0027s how it was supposed to work. She cast her spell, and the poet wouldn\u0027t be able to live without her. But he hadn\u0027t called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you wanted me to.\" He unlocked the front door, and she followed him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hurt my feelings,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was being dumb.\" She put her hand on his hip. Tentative. This would be the test. If he shrugged her off, then she was barking up the wrong tree. \"Can we go in the bedroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGotcha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood stiffly, let her unzip him, strip him clean. She unbuttoned her blouse, wriggled out of her too tight jeans, white breasts spilling over a red lace bra. She peeled off thong panties. They moved to the bed and didn\u0027t talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was on top of him, Morgan tilted his head back into the pillow, closed his eyes. Ginny ground into him, bit her lower lip hard. Even if Morgan never helped her writing career, she still liked this part. Liked it a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold Jenks slumped at the bar between his new classmates Timothy Lancaster III and Wayne DelPrego. They\u0027d just started their fourth pitcher of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen class had ended and Morgan had walked out, Jenks had just stood there with his balls in his hand. His first poem hadn\u0027t gone over so well, so he\u0027d really tried to sell this one, put everything into it. Make it one righteous, kick-ass performance. But by the time he\u0027d finished reading, he\u0027d found himself in a roomful of truly terrified white people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the class had filed out, carefully not making eye contact. But Wayne DelPrego had approached him, shaking his head, a smart-ass grin crooked on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ Almighty,\" DelPrego said. \"You\u0027ve either got some jumbo, supersized testicles or you\u0027re high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks told DelPrego to fuck his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy, man,\" DelPrego said. \"The poetry thing\u0027s a tough gig. Let me buy you a beer. Timothy and I get one after every workshop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks thought briefly about busting DelPrego in the mouth, but decided a beer would be more helpful. He looked at his watch. It wasn\u0027t even noon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime flew by at the bar, and Jenks found himself deep in meaningless conversation with Lancaster and DelPrego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen the statistics on college binge drinking?\" Lancaster held his beer mug up for inspection, wiped a smudge clean with his napkin. \"This is dangerously stereotypical behavior we\u0027re engaging in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah?\" Jenks said. \"Well, you just ended your sentence with a preposition.\" Dr. Grayson had just drilled him on prepositions yesterday in the Writing Lab. She was one hard-core bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch¨¦.\" Lancaster sipped beer, but it had gotten warm. He frowned, pushed the mug away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" DelPrego said. \"After Morgan\u0027s class, we need a few belts. That guy doesn\u0027t like anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear that.\" Lancaster had told Jenks his poem amounted to little more than predictable rhyme and juvenile posturing. No imagery, little attention to the intricacies of language. Jenks wasn\u0027t totally sure he knew what that meant, but he was sure it wasn\u0027t good. But at least Lancaster hadn\u0027t walked out of class looking like he was about to puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis shit was going to be harder than he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well, he wasn\u0027t totally without a point,\" Lancaster said. He waved the bartender over. \"Take this away,\" he said, indicating the beer mug. \"Bring me a chardonnay please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big bartender scowled down at him. \"This ain\u0027t exactly a chardonnay-type place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks chuckled. It was true. The place was pretty rough and backwoodsy. A long unpainted pine bar, mismatched stools, seats, and tables. DelPrego had told Jenks that the noise coming out of the jukebox was some shit called Vince Gill. But the place had pool tables and cold beer, and right now that was enough. DelPrego had convinced Jenks and Lancaster to enter the place on the grounds the drinks were cheap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like my rhymes?\" Jenks asked Lancaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a second, Sherman.\" Lancaster turned back to the bartender. \"Do you have any wine at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender bent behind the bar, came back up with a screw-cap jug the size of a Volkswagen, half-full. \"This. It\u0027s red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God. No, I can\u0027t drink that. Just a glass of water with lemon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender rolled his eyes and walked away. It didn\u0027t look like he was in any hurry to bring Lancaster his water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks tapped Lancaster\u0027s shoulder. \"I asked you a question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster sighed. \"Frankly, I didn\u0027t care for it. Perhaps I\u0027m too traditional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego snickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you too,\" Jenks said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s another thing,\" Lancaster said. \"You don\u0027t seem to get the idea of the workshop. Perhaps they do it differently where you\u0027re from. But essentially, we\u0027re supposed to say whatever we think about the work. You\u0027re not supposed to take it personally. I mean it\u0027s about focusing on the work, not the person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you can talk, Timothy,\" DelPrego said. \"Professor Morgan didn\u0027t like your shit either. Or mine for that matter. He hates us, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks slapped the bar with an open palm. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m talking \u0027bout. That motherfucker can\u0027t be pleased about nothing. Why try? He ain\u0027t going to like it anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just have to tune in to his aesthetic,\" Lancaster said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now I\u0027m just going to tune in to this.\" DelPrego gulped beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Jenks said. \"You know all about it, then explain this shit to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try,\" Lancaster said. \"Poetry is like, it\u0027s like...\" He pinched his thumb and forefinger together like he was trying to pluck the definition of poetry out of midair. \"Poetry is reminding you about truths you forgot you already knew. A poem doesn\u0027t tell us something, it shows us. It doesn\u0027t reflect an experience. A poem is its own experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand one fucking thing you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s all get some guns and go to Mexico,\" DelPrego said. \"Let\u0027s get whores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that sounds constructive,\" Lancaster said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you cats like to earn a few extra dollars?\" asked Jenks. He realized he was feeling a bit drunk himself but didn\u0027t care. He drained his mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who you want us to kill?\" DelPrego said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks didn\u0027t laugh. \"I\u0027m serious. Can you boys be tough? Can we be tight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster sighed. \"I think you\u0027re both already tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I ain\u0027t so fucked up I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about. You guys got enough money? Is that it? You\u0027re so up to your asses in greenbacks that you don\u0027t need any more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it something illegal?\" asked DelPrego. \"I mean, I don\u0027t care. I just want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, I ain\u0027t saying nothing until I knew we\u0027re tight. This kinda shit get fucked up quick if it ain\u0027t handled by guys that don\u0027t have trust. Now, when I see we tight, I\u0027ll let you know. But I\u0027m thinking we can be tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there some sort of written exam for this?\" Lancaster asked. \"How does one go about becoming tight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you when it happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks still wasn\u0027t sure about these two, but they seemed to be regular guys. They just wanted to find out how to get through school, how to get ahead, how to keep a roof over their heads and once in a while find some pussy. Lancaster was a little strange and maybe too smart for his own damn good, but he didn\u0027t talk down to Jenks. He didn\u0027t patronize. A word he got from Grayson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatronize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want you sons a bitches out of here right now. Just about had enough of listening to your bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them spun on their barstools, looked into the glassy eyes of two gigantic rednecks. They had full, thick beards, bellies hanging over big belt buckles. One wore a Sooners cap. The other had a buzz cut and a faded Marine Corps tattoo on his massive upper arm. They both held pool cues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fresh cigarette dangled from Sooner Cap\u0027s mouth. It bobbed up and down as he talked. \"We don\u0027t want your kind in here. So get the hell out right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks almost said something, but DelPrego opened his mouth first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, guys. It\u0027s the twenty-first century,\" DelPrego said. \"Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve never seen a black person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t give a shit about blacks,\" Tattoo Man said. \"It\u0027s him.\" He jabbed a finger at Lancaster. \"We don\u0027t like faggots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster\u0027s jaw dropped. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of our bar, faggot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood drained from Lancaster\u0027s face. \"But-I assure you-\" he sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was trouble. Jenks sized up the rednecks. Both of them tensed for it. Sooner Cap had on a pair of heavy work boots, but Tattoo Man wore only soft sneakers.

He didn\u0027t like the way they held those pool cues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego hopped off his stool, spoke to Sooner Cap. \"He\u0027s not a faggot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, punk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no faggot, and I should know,\" DelPrego said. \"Because I\u0027m the faggot, and I just love to suck big cock.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-9.html","bookId":2247,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM"}
