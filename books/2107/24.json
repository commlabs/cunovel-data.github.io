The security of the Edificant Library was at stake, Cadderly believed, and his ability to discern the source of the chaos curse and the background of the powerful priest would be a critical factor in reestablishing that security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly knew that the implications of what had happened might go far beyond the library itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarradoon, on the lake to the east, was not a large and well-fortified town, and the elves of Shilmista were neither numerous nor particularly interested in affairs beyond their own borders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the appearance of the evil priest foreshadowed things to come, then Cadderly\u0027s headmasters desperately needed information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young scholar alternated his time researching known curses and known symbols. He pored through dozens of tomes and ancient, yellowed scrolls, and interviewed every scholar, host or visitor, who had any knowledge of either field. The evil priest had proclaimed Talona as his goddess, and the trident symbol was somewhat similar to the Lady of Poison\u0027s triangle-and-teardrop insignia, but what particular organization that trident represented, Cadderly could not discover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica watched Cadderly from a distance, not wanting to disturb his vital work. She understood the discipline that Cadderly now needed, the focused determination that excluded everything else, including her, from his days. The young woman was not concerned; she knew that as soon as time permitted, she and Cadderly would continue their relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Ivan and Pikel, the days passed with wonderful boredom. Both dwarves had been beaten badly in the catacombs, but both were soon well on the way to recovery. Pikel held fast to his resolve to become a druid, and Ivan, after witnessing Newander\u0027s heroics, no longer chided him about his choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not thinking a dwarf would make a druid,\" Ivan huffed whenever anyone asked him about it,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"but it\u0027s me brother\u0027s choice to be making.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo life gradually returned to normal at the proud and ancient library. Summer came on in full and the sunshine seemed like deliverance from the nightmare. Those who came to the library\u0027s front doors that season often noticed, basking high in the branches of a tree along the road, a plump white squirrel, usually licking casasa-nut and butter from its paws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the elf prince Elbereth, the sun did not seem so marvelous. Rather, it revealed him, leaving him open and vulnerable. It was a strange feeling for the skilled warrior, who could put four arrows in the air before the first ever hit its mark, and who could cut down an enraged giant with his finely crafted sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that same warrior training that told Elbereth to be afraid now. A week before, he had led a contingent of elves against a small party of huge and hairy bugbears. His troops had won the encounter quickly, but, unlike the expected rabble filtering down from the wild mountains, these bugbears were well disciplined and well armed, and each wore a glove bearing a similar insignia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth had fought in several wars. He knew an advanced scouting party when he encountered one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe determined elf plodded on through the broken mountain passes, leading his weary horse. The multitude of bells on the shining white steed did not ring cheerily in Elbereth\u0027s ears, nor did the sun seem so warm. The magic of Shilmista had long been on the wane; Elbereth\u0027s proud people were not so numerous anymore. If a major attack did come, Shilmista would be Sorely pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth had left the forest, bearing one of the gloves, to discover what his people might be up against, to the only place in the region where he might learn of his enemies: the Edificant Library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked again at the curious trident-and-bottle design on the glove, then high and far in the distance, to the ivy-strewn structure just coining into view. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-canticle-the-cleric-quintet-1/page-24.html","bookId":2107,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:50 PM"}
