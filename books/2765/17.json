She\u0027s in heat and was supposed to be bred with a stud. Now she\u0027ll have a litter of mutts instead of purebreds. It\u0027s all because you can\u0027t control your animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man looks like he\u0027s about to have a coronary and his wrinkles threaten to crease further into his waxy skin. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say, trying to break the tension while thinking the only stud around here is my mutt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Obermeyer holds his hands up. \"Sorry?\" he says. \"How is your \u0027sorry\u0027 going to change the situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0027t. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s not a purebred, your responsibility is to have him fixed.\" Pursing his lips together, Mr. Obermeyer stalks off with Princess strutting beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care if Mutt isn\u0027t a purebred. He\u0027s mine. And Avi gave him to me, which makes him more valuable than any purebred. Oh, no! Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run over to Mutt and clasp the leash on him. I walk back home, but stay a safe distance behind Mr. Obermeyer and his bitch, waiting long enough for them to reach the condo before I venture into the elevator with my stud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find Avi sitting on our couch, his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clasped together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry it took so long,\" I say, releasing Mutt and hanging the leash back on the hook. \"There was kind of a commotion at the dog park.\" I look over at Mutt, who is now stretched out on his back on the floor looking more relaxed and content than I\u0027ve ever seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I going to tell my dad about Princess and Mutt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you ditched me,\" Avi says, the side of his mouth quirked up. \"Amy, the more I\u0027m here, the more I realize this was a bad idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step around the couch and sit next to him. \"Don\u0027t say that. There\u0027s just a lot going on right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis midnight eyes are so different from Nathan\u0027s. They\u0027re brooding, just like my dad\u0027s. I can tell he\u0027s been through a lot just by staring into them. He\u0027s worried about something but he\u0027s trying not to show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the Israeli army?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sababa,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s sababa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means \u0027cool, awesome, no problem.\u0027\" He talks in that deep, dark voice of his that can melt my own invisible walls I\u0027ve built around myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look bigger and more muscular than this summer.\" Most American guys I know don\u0027t look as serious or manly at eighteen years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Survival training will do that to a guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. Survival training. My survival training consists of running to the racks at Neiman Marcus on the opening day of their winter blowout sale. It doesn\u0027t tone my muscles, but it definitely does hone my skills in sniffing out the best deals before anyone else can get to them. Kinda different than being stuck in a desert with a gun as your only companion. Although Neiman Marcus can be considered a battleground on those winter blowout days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you,\" I say. I omit the fact that I\u0027ve thought about him every single day since I came back from my trip to Israel. I also fail to mention that I\u0027ve been having doubts about our relationship...or non-relationship, as it might be. And even though I\u0027m totally blown away with seeing him again, I don\u0027t want to be a \"friend with benefits.\" I want more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes he? And where does Nathan fit into all of this? Ugh, I\u0027m an emotional mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi\u0027s hand reaches out to mine. As he takes hold of it, the warmth and comfort I\u0027ve been missing since the summer comes rushing back to me. His other hand touches my shoulder and slowly moves up, caressing my neck and cheek. I lean my cheek into his palm, the warmth of it drawing me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you, too,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tentatively lick my lips, scared for this first kiss that will tell both of us where we stand in this relationship. We\u0027ve got a lot to live up to. Our summer makeout sessions were sensual and emotional and made me feel drugged without any chemicals or alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans forward, watching me. His eyes are fixed on mine. \"I shouldn\u0027t want you so bad,\" he says, then his full lips capture mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt starts off like before. He brushes his lips over mine as if he\u0027s painting them... memorizing the shape and softness. I\u0027m totally getting into it, but then my mind wanders. I have no clue why. Thoughts of Nathan, and Mutt\u0027s fiasco, and my mom\u0027s pregnancy, and the dates I keep bungling and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Avi\u0027s tongue reaches for mine, the events of the day are swirling in my head. And I have this nagging feeling I\u0027m forgetting something really important, but I can\u0027t remember what. Especially while Avi\u0027s trying to take our kisses to the next level, concentrating is impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back and break the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose beautiful brooding eyes are staring back at me. \"What\u0027s going on? Is it that guy? Just tell me\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I remember! With his lips on mine I couldn\u0027t think, but now my brain starts to function again. \"I have to go to work,\" I say and hop off the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonah tried to dis God by refusing to go to Nineveh as God commanded. The poor guy was thrown into the sea and sat in a fish\u0027s belly for three days as punishment (Jonah 2:1). Didn\u0027t Jonah know you can\u0027t hide from God--He knows everything. My boyfriend however, doesn\u0027t. (Except when my friends open their big mouths.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi insists on accompanying me to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we enter the elevator again, I want to tell him everything that\u0027s been on my mind and why I\u0027m confused. But there\u0027s no time. My life is spinning out of control and there\u0027s no button or switch to stop it. Time sucks that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi,\" I say. I don\u0027t really have anything to tell him, I just want him to stop looking away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" he says, turning to me. I wish I could tell what he\u0027s thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see if I can get some time off work this week so we can do some Chicago sightseeing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need sightseeing, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t have to say he came here for me. The fact that he came all this way to spend a week in Chicago is flattering and overwhelming at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Perk Me Up! counter, I introduce Maria to Avi. Maria smiles wide and drops the cup she\u0027s holding so she can shake his hand. Then she giggles, which I\u0027ve never seen her do before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first met Avi it was a really confusing and awkward time in my life. To be honest, I was rebelling. Avi is the only guy who has ever challenged me. He stayed in the fight long enough to duke it out... mentally, of course. He\u0027s as strong on the inside as he is on the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m taking care of customers. Avi sits on one of the big cushy chairs and waits. He\u0027s leaning back with his arms crossed in front of his chest and I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s actually here while I\u0027m making skim vanilla lattes instead of spending time with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over at him every time I have a free second. And when there\u0027s nobody else in the caf√©, I ask Maria if I can make Avi one of my fave hot chocolate drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t tell me he was visiting,\" Maria whispers while I\u0027m mixing the drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well I didn\u0027t know. My dad did, though,\" I inform her as I top off the cocoa with a triple dose of vanilla-flavored whipped cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he forgot to tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess they wanted it to be a surprise.\" I have yet to tell my dad I hate surprises. Surprises are like having your period in the middle of class. Initially you\u0027re shocked and confused, then you\u0027re embarrassed and have to deal with everyone staring at you. I\u0027m self-conscious enough as it is; I don\u0027t need surprises in my life to make me feel more aware of people gawking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria holds out a cup holder for me so I can slip it onto the perfectly made hot cocoa. \"I miss my teenage years,\" she says with a wistful smile on her face. \"Boys, school, friends. Enjoy it before you grow up and have more responsibilities than you ever signed up for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already feel like I have more responsibilities than I signed up for. And I\u0027m only seventeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy specialty drink in hand, I walk over to Avi just as the door to Perk Me Up! opens. It\u0027s Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard about what happened at the dog park today. Amy, are you okay?\" Her hair is brown and stick-straight and her eyes look darker than usual because she\u0027s wearing a black top. It takes her a second to focus on the guy in the chair, but when she does, a little shriek escapes from her mouth. \"Avi?\" she asks, totally pointing like a little kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi stands and I clear my throat. \"Jessica, this is Avi. Avi, this is my best friend Jessica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me Jess,\" she says, smiling so wide I think her cheeks are going to crack and her lips stretch out so much she reminds me of that elastic woman from the cartoon movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me he was coming?\" she says through gritted teeth although Avi can hear every word that\u0027s coming out of her mouth. Duh! He\u0027s standing right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know,\" I say back. \"It was a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess knows I hate surprises, thus the understanding \"Oh\" comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened at the dog park today?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really want to share the disaster so I just say, \"Urn...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mutt humped another dog and impregnated her right in front of everyone,\" Jess blurts out. \"The owner of the other dog almost called the cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was no big deal,\" I say, trying to blow it off. Well, at least I\u0027m trying to make it look like I\u0027m blowing it off. It actually is a major deal and my dad is going to kill me when he finds out Princess\u0027s womb is ruined because of my dog. And the fact that he might be a grandpa to a basketful of puppies in a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, are you kidding? Everyone knows,\" Jess says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi leans forward with a confused look on his face. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I don\u0027t know.\" It\u0027s the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d like to give Avi the hot chocolate concoction I made him, but the whipped cream is melting and running down the side of the cup onto my hand and it doesn\u0027t look as decadent and appetizing as it did before Jess came in the caf√©. And now my hand is all grody and sticky from the melting, now lopsided whipped cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going for a walk,\" Avi says, obviously upset I\u0027ve shut him out. I can\u0027t even blame him for being pissed as I watch him open the door and step out into the cold. I wish I could tell him what\u0027s going on, but how can I express it to him when I don\u0027t even have it all figured out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now it\u0027s just Jessica and me standing together. \"Ooh, can I have that?\" she says, eyeing the drink in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove my \"Avi peace offering\" at her and go back to working behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy can\u0027t things go my way? Is this God\u0027s way of entertaining me so I don\u0027t have a boring life? I swear, for once I\u0027d like to have a calm, uneventful day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria is in the middle of blending the new Tango Mango Cr√®me Blend for a customer. The entire caf√© now smells like mangoes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-17.html","bookId":2765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:53 PM"}
