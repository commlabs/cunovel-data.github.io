It was some kind of a boiler room, and a big one; heavy, thrumming machinery filled the large chamber, surrounded by winding catwalks. Massive turbines spun and pounded, generating power in a steady whine as hidden ducts spat out steam at short intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved slowly into the poorly lit chamber, peering down one of the railed walkways into the fluctuating shadows cast by the towering generators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where she was, she could see that the place was a labyrinth of paths, twining around the giant blocks of noisy machinery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source of the estate\u0027s power. That explains how they managed to keep it a secret for so long, they had their own little city out here, totally autonomous, probably had their food shipped in, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned down the narrow walk to her right, watching uneasily for any more of the strange, pale zombies that she\u0027d seen in the corridors of B3. The path seemed clear, but with the movement and noise created by the turbines...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething ripped at her left shoulder, a sudden, violent slash that tore open her vest and scraped the skin beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill spun and fired, the roar of the shotgun drowning out the hissing machines. The blast hit metal, pellets ricocheting into the empty walk. There was nothing behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lunging, blade-like claw sliced the air in front of her face, swooping down from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stumbled back, staring up at the steel mesh of the ceiling and saw a dark shape skitter out of the shadows, hooking its way across the grate incredibly fast, curving claws at its hands and feet. She caught a glimpse of thick spines around its mutant, flattened face and then it turned and ran into the thrumming shadows of the power room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a door at the end of the walk and Jill sprinted toward it, heart racing, the pounding whine of the generators thundering in her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was five feet from the door when she saw the moving shadow position itself in front of her. She raised the shotgun and leaned back - - more of them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two of the creatures overhead, squat, terrible things with vicious, curving hooks instead of hands. One of them dropped down suddenly, hanging by clawed feet to swipe at her with its bladed arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill fired and the creature screeched, the blast hitting it in the chest. It fell from the ceiling with a clatter, thick blood oozing out of the ragged wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back toward the entrance and ran, hearing the patter of claws against the mesh overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of the aberrant monkey-like things swung down in front of her, and Jill ducked, afraid to stop running. The thing\u0027s strange arm whistled past her ear, missing her head by less than an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe metal doors were in front of her. Jill crashed into them, slapping one handle down and stumbling back into the cold stillness of the corridor. The door closed on the furious, shrill cry of one of the monsters, rising high over the sounds of the working machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sagged against the door, gasping and saw Barry Burton standing midway down the chilled, silent hall. He hurried toward her, an expression of deep worry on his rugged, bearded face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill! Are you alright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed away from the door, surprised. God, Barry, where have you been? I thought you\u0027d gotten lost in the tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry nodded grimly. I did. And I ran into some trouble trying to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the splatters of blood on his clothing, the rips and tears in his shirt, and realized that he must have come across more of those walking green nightmares. He looked like he\u0027d been through a war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill touched her shoulder, her ringers coming away bloody. It was painful but shallow; she\u0027d survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry, we\u0027ve got to get out of here. I found some papers upstairs, proof of what\u0027s been going on. Enrico was right, Umbrella\u0027s behind all of this and one of the S.T.A.R.S. knew about it. It\u0027s too dangerous to keep looking around, we should get those files and head back to the mansion, wait for the RPD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think I found the main lab, Barry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, there\u0027s an elevator at the end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are computers and stuff. We can get into their files, really nail \u0027em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t seem excited by the find, but Jill barely noticed. With the information they could get from Umbrella\u0027s database: names, dates, research material...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can find out everything, present the investigators with the whole, messy package...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill nodded, grinning. Lead the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnels had been a cold, miserable maze, but the map had led them through quickly. Rebecca and Chris had reached the first basement level, both of them shivering and wet - and not a little freaked out by the dead creatures they\u0027d passed along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Umbrella scientists had been disgustingly creative in their approach to making monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris rattled the door that supposedly led to the heliport, but it was solidly locked, an emergency sign next to it implying that it could only be opened by an alarm system. He\u0027d hoped to send Rebecca out with the radio while he searched for the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down the narrow stairwell and sighed, turning to her. I want you to stay here. If you stand by the elevator, you should be able to pick up Brad\u0027s signal from outside. Tell him where we are and what happened - and if I\u0027m not back in twenty minutes, get back to the courtyard and wait there until help comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlustered, Rebecca shook her head. But I want to go with you! I can take care of myself, and if you find the lab, you\u0027ll need me to tell you what you\u0027re looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. For all we know, Wesker already killed the other S.T.A.R.S. and is looking to finish the job. If we\u0027re the last ones, we can\u0027t risk both of us getting ambushed. Somebody has to survive and tell people about Umbrella. I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s the only way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her, putting a hand on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know you can take care of yourself. This isn\u0027t about your competence, okay? Twenty minutes. I just have to see if anyone else made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca opened her mouth as if to protest further and then closed it, nodding slowly. Okay, I\u0027ll stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris turned and started down the ladder, hoping he could keep his promise to come back. The captain had successfully deceived them all, acting the part of concerned leader for weeks while the people in Raccoon City had died and all along he\u0027d known why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was a sociopath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that Umbrella had created more than one kind of monster. And it was time to find out how much damage he\u0027d done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry couldn\u0027t bring himself to look at Jill as they took the elevator down to B4. Wesker would be waiting for them at the bottom, and Jill would find out that he had been helping the captain all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d killed three more of the violent, springing creatures down in the tunnels before making it to the lab only to run into Wesker, who had insisted that he lure Jill down to B4 and assist him in locking her up. The smiling bastard had reminded Barry of his family\u0027s situation and promised again that it was the last thing he\u0027d have to do, that after Jill was safely locked away he\u0027d call his people off - - except he\u0027s said that every time. Find the crests and you\u0027re free. Help me in the tunnels, you\u0027re free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetray your friend...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry, are you okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to her as the elevator stopped, looking miserably into her concerned, thoughtful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been worried about you ever since we got to the mansion, she said, laying a hand across his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even thought - well, never mind what I thought. Is something wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the gate open and raised the mesh outer door, an excuse to look away. I... yeah, something\u0027s wrong, he said quietly. But now\u0027s not the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s just get this over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill frowned but nodded, still looking concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. When this is over, we can talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou won\u0027t want to talk to me when this is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry stepped out into the short hallway and Jill followed, their boots clanking across a steel grate. The hall turned to the left just ahead and Barry slowed down on the pretense of checking his weapon, letting Jill get in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned the corner and Jill froze, staring into the muzzle of Wesker\u0027s raised Beretta. He grinned at them, his sunglasses hiding his eyes, his smile smug and leering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello, Jill. Nice of you to drop by, he said smoothly. Nice work, Barry. Take her weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her startled gaze to him as he quickly plucked the shotgun from her hands, then reached around to unholster her Beretta, his face burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow get back up to Bl and wait for me by the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be up in a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry stared at him. But you said you just wanted to lock her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWesker shook his head. Oh, don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going to hurt her, I promise. Now get going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill looked at him, confusion and fear and anger playing across her face. Barry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry, Jill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and walked around the corner, feeling defeated and ashamed - not to mention terrified for Jill. Wesker had promised, but Wesker\u0027s word meant nothing. He\u0027d probably kill her as soon as he heard the elevator doors close, but what if I\u0027m not in the elevator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I can still do something to keep her alive...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry hurried to the lift and opened the gates, then slammed them closed and pushed the operation switch, sending it back to B3 without a passenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving silently, he edged back toward the corner, listening. ... can\u0027t say I\u0027m all that surprised, Jill was saying. But how did you get Barry to help you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWesker laughed. Ol\u0027 Barry\u0027s got some trouble at home. I told him that Umbrella has a team watching his house, waiting to kill his precious family. He was only too happy to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry clenched his fists, his jaw tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re a bastard, you know that? Jill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. But I\u0027m going to be a rich bastard when all this is over. Umbrella is paying me a lot of money to clean up their little problem, and to get rid of a few of you goddamn snooping S.T.A.R.S. in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would Umbrella want to destroy the S.T.A.R.S.? Jill asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, not all of them. They\u0027ve got big plans for some of us, at least those of us that want to make a profit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s you sniveling do-gooders that they don\u0027t want, the red-white-and-blue, apple pie, all that happy bullshit. The way Redfield\u0027s been running around, mouthing off about conspiracies, you think Umbrella didn\u0027t notice? It has to stop, here. This whole place was rigged to blow up just in case of an accident and the Tyrant virus escaping qualifies. Once you\u0027re all dead and this facility\u0027s destroyed, no one will be able to get to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSon-of-a-bitch was going to kill all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut enough about Umbrella. I had you brought down here for a little experiment of my own. I want to see how our most agile team member stands up against the miracle of modern science. If you\u0027ll just step through that door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry flattened himself against the wall as Wesker stepped back, part of his shoulder coming into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hand on his Colt and drew it out slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe that you\u0027re doing this, Jill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelling out to protect a bunch of unethical corporate blackmailers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackmailers? Oh, you mean Barry. Umbrella wouldn\u0027t bother with blackmail. They can afford to buy people just as easily. I made all that up to get him on board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry slammed the butt of his Colt into Wesker\u0027s skull as hard as he could, dropping him like a ton of bricks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-umbrella-conspiracy-resident-evil-1/page-19.html","bookId":2456,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:07 PM"}
