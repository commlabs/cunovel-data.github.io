Percy straightened his raven mask as we maneuvered through the throng of guests. The ornate costumes added to the festive air and created the fantastical illusion of a faerie court. There was a sense of magick in the air and I wished for a moment that Ignatius was at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Countess Dracula!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized the insipid voice at once and was determined to ignore it. To my dismay, I was routed by the worst gossip in Buda when she abruptly stepped before me, waving her hand. Borbála’s heavily made up face and jeweled mask were more gruesome than appealing, but her black gown, that was decorated to depict the constellations, was clever and quite lovely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess Dracula, I so want you to meet my distant cousin who is visiting me this winter,” she gasped out. I suspected she had rushed through the crowd in an attempt to intercept me. She drew a beautiful young woman to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dumbfounded and I am certain my expression reflected this truth. I struggled to regain my senses as I gaped at the young woman at Borbála’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her name is Ilinca, and I have told her all about you.” Borbála smiled at me vapidly, her mouth a slash of red menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlinca was lovelier than I had remembered. Dark tendrils of her hair fell against her soft cheek as she regarded me, interest looming in her mismatched eyes. Her headdress, a glittery crescent moon, sparkled on her head and her white gown was delicate and beautiful with its rich silver embroidery and sparkling beading. “How lovely to meet you at last. My dear cousin has told me so much about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing a smile onto my face, I took her proffered hand. Her hand was warm with life. She had fed recently. My eyes slid to Borbála’s throat. “I am charmed to meet you. I am afraid I do not have the benefit of knowing about you before this moment, but it is a pleasure.” I was awed by Ilinca’s beauty and also by her presence. If I did not know who she was, I would have thought she was mortal. I could not feel her power and her appearance was startlingly human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My visit was unexpected,” Ilinca answered. Her eyes glittered as she spoke and her full mouth was beguiling with its rich dark color and gentle smile. “My brother and I had hoped to establish a new home before winter, but it has been difficult securing a new estate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can only commiserate. My home burned to the ground earlier this year and I am the guest of the baroness.” I immediately realized the folly of my words. My phrase could definitely be regarded as accusatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” she said, her eyes slightly narrowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon my manners, this is my dear friend, Percy,” I said quickly, trying to maintain a more civil and normal conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy bowed over her hand in greeting. If he could sense my discomfort, his actions did not reveal this knowledge. “It is a pleasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are English?” Ilinca tilted her head slightly as she regarded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I am. I am a merchant and I travel to Buda often for my work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? And what is your business?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlinca turned her full attention to Percy as he answered in some detail. Borbála stood at her side radiating pride. I did not believe for a moment that Borbála was Ilinca’s cousin. I suspected she was in Ilinca’s thrall. Ilinca could not have picked a better minion. Borbála knew all the gossip in the city. Who better to draw into her power so she could uncover the truth about me and my companions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you and Countess Dracula are related?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned my full attention to the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no, no. We are merely friends,” Percy answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friends are always good to have, don’t you think?” Ilinca smiled sweetly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course. Always!” I giggled nervously. “Especially at parties!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Speaking of friends, I think I had best go rescue Laura,” Percy said, lightly touching my shoulder. He gestured with his chin at Laura. She was seated on the far side of the room looking fairly put out as Dietrich tried to cajole her into a dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes! You must get her away from that horrible boy.” I did not want Ilinca to become too interested in Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shall return shortly. Ladies...” Percy bowed, excusing himself, then wound his way through the guests toward Laura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNervously, I returned my gaze to Ilinca. She was staring at me with a bemused expression upon her lovely face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cousin Borbála, go find Gavril and tell him I am speaking with Countess Dracula,” Ilinca said, her eyes gazing steadily into my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes! I will do that immediately!” Borbála rushed off in great haste, not out of fear, but excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was much I wanted to say, but I held my tongue. I remembered Astir and Ignatius’s warnings all too well. I was to be the vapid countess that was not a threat. It was not the time to be defiant or reckless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been so looking forward to visiting with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have met before,” I dared to say, attempting to keep my tone light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile widened even more. “Yes, we have,” Ilinca said, tucking her hand into mine and drawing me into a corner away from the party. “Let me speak frankly and openly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my desire to be brave, my fingers trembled in hers. “What shall we speak about?” It was a daring question, but I could not imagine why she was so keenly interested in me beyond my attachment to my Master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As to whether or not I should kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost drew away, but caught myself. Instead, I forced a laugh that sounded a little too high and nervous. To my surprise, she laughed with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am inclined to adhere to the agreement my brother and I have with your husband. My brother disagrees with me, but then again, Gavril sees everyone as a threat. He is quite protective of me.” Ilinca smiled. It was sweet and pure and yet terrified me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not privy to my husband’s dealings,” I said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not?” She studied me closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I said in all truth, “Vlad never speaks to me of his plans. I was not even aware there were other vampires about in the city. I only learned of you and your brother through Lady Astir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is what Astir said to us.” She seemed pleased with my honest response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My husband is not inclined to share any of his business with me.” I allowed the bitterness I felt against him to taint my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore, he sent you back to Buda without informing you of Baatar’s fate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not even know about Baatar until recently. Or about you.” I shrugged slightly. “My husband would prefer that I do as he says and not ask questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that difficult for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am merely his loyal wife.” I suspected she could sense my rebellious nature and I shifted uncomfortably on my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly?” She arched her fine, dark brows slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course! He expects nothing less than complete loyalty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did Father Ignatius come to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not speak. I merely stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A loyal, faithful wife to Count Dracula would not consort with his most detested enemy, would she?” That lovely smile was ever more terrifying despite its sweet appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are brothers by their mistress’ blood.” My defense sounded empty even to my own ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlinca’s eyes sparkled as she laughed lightly. It was a carefree sound, yet it made me want to retch out of fear. “My brother and I agree that you are much more than Vlad Dracula’s vapid English Bride no matter what Lady Astir proclaims. Gavril is afraid that you are a co-conspirator against us. I disagree. I do not think you met with Father Ignatius to plot against us. I think you met with him to plot against your absentee husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my gaze as I was left speechless. I struggled to grasp the words to say, but I could not fashion a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling me deeper into the shadows, she drew close to me. Her eyes staring into mine, she whispered, “I know what it is to love he that is forbidden. I can see it in your eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I...” Words were lost to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that you hate Vlad. I have seen it in your dreams. He killed your family, did he not? Killed you? Made you his Bride? Now he has cast you aside to reside in the city while he does as he wills elsewhere. I know all about Vlad Dracula. The plotter, the schemer, the warrior, the prince, the impaler.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not take my gaze away from her face as she spoke. I was mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are his little pawn on an enormous and complicated chessboard. I can see that so clearly. But you do not want to wait for him to return to reclaim you as his own. I sense that within you as well. Is that why Father Ignatius visited you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is my friend,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is your lover.” She smirked. “Are you conspiring against Vlad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” It was the honest truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes stared deeply into mine. “I believe you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I desire is to live my life in peace. I will not interfere with you, or your brother’s dealings in any way. I swear it.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-47.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
