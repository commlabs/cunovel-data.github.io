He wanted that girl in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands fisted. I’d been wrong about his sense of honesty. He’d lied to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered what he’d said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Do you want Veronica?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: No. Not even a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiar! I longed to shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow easy it would be to stalk into the ring, sink my teeth into his spirit and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis spirit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, good glory. Was I thinking like the zombies now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my chin, squared my shoulders. I’d rather die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to concentrate for real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—report every detail,” Cole was saying. “I don’t just want to hear that you survived the night, or that you did or didn’t see any zombies. I’m not kidding, I want every detail. In writing. From all of you. Two partners can’t turn in one report. I want two from two, and I want you to write them separately. After what happened to Justin and Ali, I’m in an information-gathering mood.” Shadows and light battled for dominance on his face, giving him a sinister bent. “Got me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned the murmuring crowd, bypassed me and quickly returned. Guilt flashed in his eyes, only to be extinguished, leaving the cold, blank mask. He stood, forcing Veronica to stand as well, and dropped his arms to his sides. She remained only a whisper away and frowned when she noticed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held Cole’s gaze, again not expecting a vision, but wanting one—no, I didn’t want one, shouldn’t want one, but...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointment grew wings of sharply honed iron and flew through every inch of me, cutting at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t give him a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away. “From now on,” he said, voice harder now, harsher, “if your partner gets bitten, administer the antidote the moment you’re able. Don’t wait until the fight is over. And if your partner bites you, don’t try to hide it from us. We’re not going to blame him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or her,” Mackenzie called, and snapped her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now you’re just giving the girls permission to take a nibble anytime, anyplace,” Frosty retorted. “I’ve got enough trouble keeping them off me as it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckles resounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t force myself to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know who your partners are,” Cole said, “and where you’ve been placed in the schedule. Do what you have to do to get ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group broke apart; some kids were to walk the streets, hunting zombies; some were to go home and rest, catch up on schoolwork; some were to stay here and guard the bodies of the slayers, also waiting in case backup was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeronica rose on her tiptoes and whispered in Cole’s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fury returned, expanded, but I managed to calmly say, “What about me?” and step up to the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes darted in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali Bo Bali,” Frosty said, throwing his arm over my shoulder. “I didn’t think we’d see you tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appreciated the show of support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?” Cole replied, hesitant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteady. “I want in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle ticked below his eye as he approached me. “After what happened today? No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened today?” Veronica asked, coming over to rest her head on his shoulder. Staking a claim? Digging the knife deeper?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone told her what I’d gone through...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole eased away from her and massaged the back of his neck, a habit of his. Right now he was more than uncomfortable. He was discombobulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re injured,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m healed. Besides that, others have fought injured and you never complained.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Others have had more training. And why do you have bandages on your wrists?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d noticed them, even though I wore long sleeves?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to control my sudden trembling, I pulled the bandages off for good. My skin was more reddened than before, and far more swollen, but the ink was still pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeronica leaned toward me, shrugged. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but those are too big for your bone structure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a right way to take that? I knew the tattoos were beautiful and just the right size for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t give her the satisfaction of a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that wasn’t true. I would. “I’m seconds away from giving you a brand-new bone structure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at me as if I was missing a few screws. “I’ve been nothing but nice to you, and you want a go at me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was nice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the tattoos are perfect.” Cole stepped between us. His narrowed gaze roved over me, lingered in a few select places. I had to fight a shiver. “Tattoos. New hair. New makeup. I didn’t notice it before. You were too wet. I’m noticing now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wet?” Veronica said, the word almost strangled out of her. “Wet how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScowling, Cole pushed her toward the rings. “Go. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of wished the floor would open up and swallow me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flicked me a confused glance over her shoulder but did as he’d commanded and left us alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting back on track. He had a problem with my makeover? “Are you saying I’m eye broccoli?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrosty barked out a laugh. “Where do girls get this stuff, man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not even sure what eye broccoli means,” Cole said. “That you look bad, and I shouldn’t want to eat you, or that you’re loaded with vitamins and I should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I look bad,” I gritted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t. You never have.” Cole lifted my wrists and traced his thumb around the designs. When he realized what he was doing, he scowled and dropped his arms. “So. Tell me. Why’d you make all these changes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C word overshadowed any pleasure I might have taken from his compliment...his touch. What would change tonight? Tomorrow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth hearts sped up, and my nasal passages seemed to clog with cotton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy, now,” Frosty said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole released my arms to cup my cheeks. “Breathe, Ali. Just like that. In and out. Good girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment I calmed, I pulled out of Cole’s hold and shrugged away from Frosty’s. Another rush of embarrassment washed through me. I couldn’t allow myself to rely on these guys in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that about?” Cole asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To answer your other question, the only one I’ll acknowledge,” I said tightly, “I made a few improvements. I wanted to look hot for the night my vision with Gavin comes true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirect hit—a shocker. Cole flinched, even paled. “You were hot the way you were,” he said, staring deep into my eyes. “Whatever you think of me, whatever’s happened between us, that was never up for debate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty words, nothing more, and yet the air between us charged, just like before, becoming electric with awareness. Every nerve ending in my body perked up, waiting for...something. Another visual caress. A hand on my shoulder. The nudge of his knee. Anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed up a few steps, and the charge fizzled. I could still smell his scent, though, soap and something woodsy, a hint of the animal he could sometimes be. Rough, wild, untamed. But underneath it all was the scent of roses...Veronica’s scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I’d consume both their spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you really do all this for Gavin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone was dead. As if he didn’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he’d never cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did it for me,” I said, and left it at that. I would never let him know how much he was hurting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, some of the tension leaving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension? I hadn’t noticed it. I wonder what had calmed him. Because it certainly couldn’t have been my admission. He didn’t care, remember? “Where am I in the lineup?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be on patrol tonight. Sunday you’ll rest. Monday you’ll stay here in the gym, in case you’re needed. Tuesday, patrol again. Be ready to go in ten.” He stalked into the locker room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remained in place, trying to control my inner turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeronica stood in back, watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at her, daring her to approach. No question she’d come to my Bama expecting to win Cole back by fair means or foul. Well, she’d done it. And she hadn’t even had to work that hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enjoy him while it lasts,” I called. “Apparently he has Girlfriend ADD.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away, but not before I caught the blush staining her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blush from her. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrosty cleared his throat, a demand for my full attention. “Hate to stop you when you’re going balls to the wall, but you need to talk to Reeve,” he said. “Tell her to drop whoever she’s seeing. This keeps up, and Bronx might just snap and play Prison Rules with the guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know about Reeve’s new boyfriend, Ethan?” I demanded, searching for Bronx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hammered at the punching bag with so much force I was afraid his knuckles would crack. Dark hair streaked with blue was wet and plastered to his scalp. Sweat dripped from his temples to his bare shoulders, then down the ripped cords of his abs, and if I’d been with Cole, I wouldn’t have watched those droplets, mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky Reeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrosty patted me on top of the head. “Aren’t you cute? As if you don’t know the answer to your own question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Kat. “Forget Reeve. Her life, her decisions. Your problem is the fact that Kat wants self-defense lessons, and I promised to give them to her. I know she would love it if you helped.” And with my new...urges, it would be better all the way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncomfortable with the new direction of the conversation, he shifted from one booted foot to the other. “No. And you’re going to tell her you changed your mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you kidding me? No, I’m not.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-zombie-glass-white-rabbit-chronicles-2/page-18.html","bookId":2521,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM"}
