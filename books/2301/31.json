She hadn\u0027t moved, hadn\u0027t said a word. “Susie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she lifted her head and looked at me. “Joe\u0027s been helping me adjust,” she said, her voice so low it was barely audible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe, I thought. Who\u0027s Joe? And then I realized she meant Cagin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He promised to stay with me when the moon is full.” She looked at Cagin, the horror in her eyes changing, softening. “He understands me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood grief, she sounded like she was in love with him! But how could that be? She couldn\u0027t have known him for more than a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to get out of here,” Cagin remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe nodded. “We need to get rid of the body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two can take care of that,” I said. “I\u0027m taking Susie home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was silent in the car. Now and then, a long shuddering sigh escaped her lips, but other than that, and a few tears, she just stared out the window, her hands folded so tightly in her lap, her knuckles were white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached Susie\u0027s house, I pulled into the driveway. I cut the ignition, then helped her out of the car and up the walk. Inside, I urged her to sit down; then I went into the kitchen and fixed her a cup of tea heavily laced with some brandy I found in one of the cupboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefusing to meet my gaze, she drank it without question, then put the cup aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was going to kill me,” she said, her voice devoid of emotion. “He said he was sorry, but it was his duty. He told me not to worry, that he\u0027d look after the boys, and then he pulled a knife….” She looked up at me for the first time. “He had the knife at my throat, and then Cagin was there, and…” She began to tremble. “I\u0027m cold,” she murmured. “So cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into her bedroom and pulled a blanket off the bed. I tried to imagine what it had been like for her, feeling the knife against her skin as she waited for her husband to slit her throat, then watching while Cagin attacked and killed her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the living room, I draped the blanket around her shoulders, then sat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusie lifted a hand to her throat. “If it wasn\u0027t for Cagin, I\u0027d be dead now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seem very…” I searched for the right word. “Very fond of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blush stained her cheeks. “He\u0027s been very kind to me. He listens when I talk. He makes me feel like what I have to say is worthwhile.” She smiled faintly. “He makes me feel beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just proved that you could never tell, from the outside, what was going on in someone else\u0027s life, or someone else\u0027s marriage. Had anyone asked, I would have said that Susie was happy with her husband and her marriage, but in just a few short sentences, she had proved me wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me through haunted eyes. “What am I going to tell my children? What if Rick was right? Maybe they would be better off without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say to that. For all I knew, Werewolves made wonderful mothers. Then again, maybe they didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusie rested her head against the back of the sofa and closed her eyes. A moment later, she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, I carried her empty cup into the kitchen, rinsed it out, and then stood at the sink, my hands braced against the edge of the counter as I stared into the darkness beyond the window. Where was Rafe? What had they done with Rick\u0027s body? How was Susie going to explain his absence to her children, her parents, his family, the townspeople? And what of Travis Jackson? No matter what story Susie concocted to cover her husband\u0027s disappearance, Travis would suspect the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a headache coming on, I fixed myself a cup of tea, then went into the living room and sat in the chair next to the sofa. Susie had been crying in her sleep. Her cheeks were damp with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart ached for her. I wished there was something I could do to help, some words of wisdom that would ease her fears. It just wasn\u0027t fair for such a sweet lady to suffer so much. But she wouldn\u0027t have to suffer alone. It was obvious that Cagin was in love with her. Given the chance, he would take care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I frowned. Cagin had said two Vampires were watching Susie\u0027s house. Having seen Rafe\u0027s grandmother there, I had assumed the other Vampire was Roshan, which begged the question, where had Rafe\u0027s grandparents been tonight? Why hadn\u0027t they followed Rick and Susie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little over an hour later when Cagin and Rafe showed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCagin didn\u0027t say a word. Lifting Susie from the sofa as if she weighed no more than a small child, he brushed a kiss across her brow, and then carried her out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she okay?” Rafe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As okay as she can be, I guess, all things considered. Where\u0027s he taking her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To his place, for tonight. Tomorrow, he\u0027s taking her away from here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Away where? And what about her kids? What\u0027s going to happen to them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know. I guess they\u0027ll stay with their grandparents for however long it takes for Susie to get a handle on her new lifestyle.” He grunted softly. “No doubt her kids will have a new father soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think she\u0027s going to marry Cagin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027d bet my next fifty years on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But…what kind of life will that be for her boys, having a Werewolf for a mother and a shape-shifter for a stepfather? And how can they marry? I mean, he\u0027s a Were-tiger and she\u0027s a Werewolf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They\u0027ll work it out. It won\u0027t be the first time such a thing has happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, amazed at his nonchalant attitude, but then, I guess after being a Vampire as long as he had, there wasn\u0027t a whole heck of a lot that surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were your grandparents tonight?” I wondered aloud. “I thought they were watching Susie\u0027s house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mara needed their help with another matter. That\u0027s why Cagin was there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He would have been there anyway,” I muttered. “You know, I don\u0027t understand you two. One minute you\u0027re trying to kill each other and the next you\u0027re both looking out for Susie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t care for him much, but he\u0027s all right. He\u0027s just got a bad temper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are Mara and Clive having any luck ending the war?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his expression suddenly grim. “Most of our people and the Werewolves have decided to sort of fade into the woodwork, so to speak, until things die down. Mara had a hard time convincing Clive it was the smart thing to do. Sometimes I think he\u0027s got more pride than brains, but he finally agreed. The hunters are more organized and more numerous than we first thought. From what I understand, more than fifty Werewolves have disappeared without a trace in the last three months or so, and about half that many Vampires, and that\u0027s just here, in the States.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe they were killed in the war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few perhaps, but not that many with no one knowing what happened to them or where they are. Come on,” he said, “we should get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. I didn\u0027t want to be in Susie\u0027s house if the police came by. I wondered again what Rafe and Cagin had done with Rick\u0027s body, and then decided I really didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached my house, Rafe walked me to the front door, then took me into his arms. “You should get some sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to say I wasn\u0027t sleepy, but I yawned instead. It wasn\u0027t that late, but it had been a trying night. “Will you stay with me until morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If that\u0027s what you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.” After all that had happened, I didn\u0027t feel like being alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unlocked the door, and Rafe followed me inside. He locked the door and then followed me down the hall to my bedroom. He sat on the foot of the bed while I went into the bathroom to change into my nightgown and brush my teeth. Even with the door closed, I could sense his presence in the next room, feel the tension stretching like a fine wire between us, taut and quivering. Right or wrong, I couldn\u0027t help wanting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a little nervous, I smoothed my gown over my hips, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe was still sitting on the bed. He hadn\u0027t been idle, though. He had removed his shirt, T-shirt, boots, and socks. His chest and shoulders were a study in masculine perfection, like a handsomely sculpted work of art. I yearned to run my hands over every inch of him, but I wasn\u0027t sure I was prepared for what would surely follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose as I walked toward the bed, his eyes glowing with need, but a need for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, I pulled back the bedspread. My gaze met his for a long moment, and then I slid under the covers, my heart pounding wildly as Rafe settled down beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax,” he said quietly. “We\u0027re just going to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved and yet a little disappointed, I closed my eyes. I had always heard that Vampires were cold-blooded creatures, but there was nothing cold about the man lying beside me. Warmth radiated from him like heat from a blast furnace, or maybe it was just my own overheated imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must think me an awful prude.” I wished I could be as blasé about sex as most of the girls in my home-town had been. Some of them had embraced the New Morality with open arms. They had changed lovers as often as they changed their hairstyles and nail polish. Marriage was old-fashioned, they\u0027d said. People were living longer now. How could anyone be expected to stay with the same person for seventy or eighty years? I pictured Rafe in my mind, thinking that seventy or eighty years would never be long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friend, Nancy Gale, had been of the opinion that a woman needed at least three husbands. Number One should be dependable and of good stock, the kind of man you\u0027d want to father your children. Husband Number Two should be carefree and full of fun, able to show a girl a good time, while Number Three should be easygoing and good at conversation, someone to spend your declining years with. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-31.html","bookId":2301,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM"}
