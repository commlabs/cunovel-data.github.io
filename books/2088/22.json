Incredible sex had given me a second wind, but there was only so much a girl could take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I awoke we were both under the sheets. Someone, not me, had drawn the heavy curtains. I glanced at Cadotte. God, he was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was smooth and dark, darker still against my plain white sheets. I wondered what he\u0027d look like with long hair. The shorn ends curled just a little, making my fingers itch to twine between them. His earring twinkled against the warm flesh of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered kissing that neck a few hours ago, being startled by the cool metal brushing my lips. When he\u0027d trailed his mouth all over my body, the earring had tickled me here and there, adding a new dimension to every embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand covered my hip. My eyes jumped from his earring to his face. He smiled. \"Morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for the usual morning-after embarrassment to descend. Before it could, he shifted closer and kissed me. Just a gentle brush of his lips against mine and then he pulled back. Something between my belly and my heart stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make coffee,\" he said, and then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took advantage of the solitude to head for the shower. The totem caught my eye from the dresser. I glanced at the bedroom door through which Cadotte had disappeared. I could hear him banging around in the kitchen, see his shadow flitting against the wall in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened a drawer and dumped the wolf on top of my underwear, then scooted into the bathroom and locked the door. I had nothing against sex in the shower -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;with Cadotte I would probably be agreeable to sex just about anywhere -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but right now I wanted to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad sex. Big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually it had been. And maybe that was the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew better than to fall for a guy like Cadotte. He was gorgeous, brilliant, a little bit strange. We had nothing in common. We probably never would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy on earth he\u0027d wanted me I had yet to figure out. But I couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d want me much longer. The best way to get out of this without getting hurt was to dump him before he dumped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis resolved, I returned to my room. The slant of the sun through the windows told me the time was long past noon. I threw on shorts and a shirt, tucked the totem underneath a pile of socks in a drawer, and walked barefoot into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte leaned against the counter, drinking coffee completely naked. He smiled as if he weren\u0027t and poured another cup. My gaze lowered. I could get used to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and I yanked my gaze upward. Raising a brow, he handed me my coffee. \"Would you like to go out for breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of walking into The Coffee Pot with him and ordering breakfast at... 2:00 p.m. was just too much for me. Besides, wasn\u0027t I showing him the door?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a sip, swallowed, nearly choked with shock. Cadotte made the best coffee I had ever tasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do to this?\" I stared into the cup as if I could find all the answers to life\u0027s mysteries in the swirling black depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sprinkle of cinnamon mixed with the grounds makes all the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have cinnamon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the back of the cabinet. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. Wonder where that came from.\" I took another sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breakfast?\" he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same emotion that had flickered in his eyes when I\u0027d refused to meet him for dinner returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore coffee. That\u0027s what I needed. I gulped half the cup, let the heat bubble in my empty stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame lame excuse I\u0027d used the last time. Unfortunately, it didn\u0027t work this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m good enough to fuck but not to eat breakfast with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spilled coffee on my shirt. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a serious conversation with a naked man was a new experience -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and downright difficult. I kept getting distracted by the way his skin shone in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may not be from here, but I know how small towns work. If it got out you were screwing an Indian, there\u0027d be trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent. There would be, but not the way he thought. I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will, I -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set his empty cup on the counter with a click and crossed the floor so fast he was crowding into my space before I knew he was coming. He captured my cup, set it aside, and took my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" he whispered. \"Why can\u0027t we just enjoy each other like we did last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"You want to do it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid his fingers into my hair. \"And again and again and again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t expected that. Still, why risk my career on something that would never last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me, his tongue teasing mine, his lips soft and warm. He tasted of coffee and cinnamon. I wanted to drink him in and keep him with me forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his head, he remained close enough that his breath mingled with mine. \"Does this have to be complicated? I want you, Jessie. You want me. Let\u0027s just keep doing what we\u0027re doing. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a gorgeous naked man asks you something like that, what else are you supposed to say but -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended up back in bed, but before things could get good, the phone shrilled. Why had I ever plugged it back in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t answer,\" Cadotte whispered against my belly. The warmth of his breath trailed along the moistness left by his tongue. I shivered and forgot all about the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil my machine clicked in and Clyde\u0027s voice came out. \"Jessie, you\u0027d better get over to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, nearly knocking Cadotte off the bed in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your victim from last night died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dived for the phone. \"Clyde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to wake you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t. I was just -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" I glanced at Will. \"Never mind. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mel. He died. Cherry is screaming blue murder. Said you told them to give him the vaccine and now he\u0027s dead. She\u0027s threatening lawsuit. It\u0027s a total goat fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. Goat fuck was Zee\u0027s favorite term. Things must be very bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up. Cadotte kissed my hip. \"Problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell me about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered and decided that I could. The incident last night, and whatever had happened at the hospital since, would be public record soon enough. I filled him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay on the bed with his arm beneath his head and stared at the ceiling with a frown, I got up and pulled my uniform out of the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the sound of this,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, me, and the rest of the Miniwa Police Department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze on the floor -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;my bra and underwear must be around here somewhere -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I didn\u0027t see him get off the bed. I didn\u0027t hear him, either. The guy moved more quietly than a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" I glanced up. He held what I was looking for in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped into my panties. Why I didn\u0027t feel embarrassed I wasn\u0027t sure. Maybe Cadotte\u0027s ease with his own nakedness was starting to wear off on me. Although I doubted I\u0027d be walking bare-assed in the woods anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was struggling with the hook on my bra when his hands covered mine. \"Let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood in front of the mirror, my eyes met his. He hooked the clasp, lowered his head, and kissed my shoulder; his earring brushed my skin. His hand slid across my belly -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dark against light, slim against round. We were so different -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and maybe that wasn\u0027t so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind skittered away from the thought. \"I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back. \"I know. Is it okay if I shower?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Just don\u0027t scare the hell out of me when I come home. Next time I might kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and what army?\" he threw over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. Not only did I want his body, but I liked his mouth -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and not just on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my sock drawer, I slammed it shut when Cadotte stuck his head out the bathroom door. \"We should meet when you get done. I\u0027ve got some ideas I\u0027m going to check out today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have a little thing called class to go to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. Where had the week gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to.\" He tilted his head. \"Maybe we should work together on this, Jessie. It couldn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde would hurt me if he found out about it. But right now, Clyde was the least of my worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how much you can help, since you think I\u0027m chasing werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made an aggravated sound and threw up my hands. \"Cadotte, you are certifiable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" He didn\u0027t appear concerned. \"What time will you be home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning most likely. Seven-thirty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the door and the sound of the shower came shortly after. I waited another minute, opened the drawer, felt for the totem, then slipped it over my head and beneath my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could it hurt for Cadotte to research his delusion? Who knows, he might even turn up something useful. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-22.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
