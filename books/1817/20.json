It seemed that she had everything packed and ready to go. I walked over to a desk that sat in the corner of the living room. It was an antique and my mom would love it. I picked up a picture of her and a guy. I assumed it was her boyfriend. They looked really happy, like Hailey and I once did. Such a tragedy and such loss for someone so young. I had a feeling that she would tell me more in time. I set the picture down and walked back to the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m ready.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she said shyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove us to Deep Hollow Ranch to go horseback riding. My mom and dad took me and Julia there when we were kids. I hadn’t been there in a few years because Hailey didn’t like horseback riding. I wanted to share this with Amelia and I hoped that she would enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A ranch?” she asked as we pulled up the dirt road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you like horses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love horses, but I’ve never been on one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at her when she said that. “You’ve never been horseback riding?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I spent my life in and on the water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, today’s your lucky day because you’re going horseback riding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ask you one favor?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it be okay if I rode with you instead of my own horse? I’m a little nervous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. I was going to suggest that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as she opened the door and got out. I watched her as she took in a deep breath of fresh air. I looked straight ahead as Murray walked towards us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, well, well. Collin Black. I haven’t seen you in years, buddy,” he said as we lightly hugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Murray. Good to see you, friend. This is Amelia.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to meet you, Amelia,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You riding the horses today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We sure are. But only one horse. Amelia’s never been horseback riding, so she’s going to ride with me first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me to the stable. I’ll set you up with Majestic. She’ll be perfect for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe followed him to the stable and he took Majestic from her stall. Murray saddled her up and I climbed on first. Amelia looked a little nervous as she stared at the horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here, sweetheart,” Murray said. “Make friends with her first if it’ll make you feel better. Talk to her and pet her. You’ll feel more comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia walked to the front of Majestic and started petting her. She ran her hand down her mane and said hi to her. I looked down at her and smiled as she looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her foot in the stirrup as I helped her onto the horse. She sat behind me and I told her to hold on. The minute she wrapped her arms around me, a feeling overtook me that I’d never felt before. I couldn’t describe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rode along the shoreline of the white sanded beach. It was breathtaking and I missed this. I was happy to be able to share this with Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin, this is beautiful,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t it? I’ve really missed this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you stop coming here?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My ex-girlfriend hated horseback riding and she would never come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She really missed out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile never left my face as the light wind swept across us as we rode down the beach. I took it slow and easy with Majestic because I didn’t want to frighten Amelia. After about an hour, I thought Amelia would like to take over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about we switch spots and you take over?” I said as I stopped the horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” she asked with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got off the horse and told Amelia to scoot up. She had a smile on her face that I’d never forget. Her blue eyes were full of light and happiness. It was the first time since we met that I saw her like this. I climbed back on behind her and told her to grab hold of the reins. I told her what to do and then I placed my hands on her hips. She looked back at me and smiled as Majestic started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God.” She laughed. “This is amazing. I love horseback riding. Thank you, Collin. Thank you for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m happy you’re enjoying it and you’re welcome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rode for about another hour. I grabbed the reins and I told her to hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go, Majestic!” I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse began to gallop and I yelled, “Woohoo!” Amelia held onto my arms tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m great. This is great.” She smiled as she turned her head and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rode back to the ranch. As I climbed off, I grabbed Amelia’s hand and helped her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what did you think?” Murray asked as he walked up to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I loved it!” Amelia replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. That’s what I like to hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook Murray’s hand and he told me not to be a stranger. He also told me to send my mom and dad over to the ranch for a visit. We walked back to the car and the clouds started to roll in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks like it’s going to rain,” I said. “Let’s get to the restaurant before it starts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Restaurant?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me you’re not hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I am.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Me too. I’m taking you to my favorite place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were seated at a quiet little corner table at Nick and Toni’s. As Amelia looked over the menu, she asked me what was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have the best chicken here with the best roasted garlic potatoes I’ve ever eaten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “I love chicken, so I think that’s what I’ll have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought us each a glass of wine and took our order. I looked at Amelia as I held my glass up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here’s to an amazing and fun day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing is right.” She smiled as she brought her glass up to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I have your phone number?” I blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me while she bit down on her bottom lip. “Are you going to call me sometime?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was planning on it, but only if you want me to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say anything for a moment and she just looked at me from across the table. “Yeah, I would like you to.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-20.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
