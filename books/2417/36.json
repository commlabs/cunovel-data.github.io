It showed Frank in white shorts and a different Hawaiian shirt, his arm around a similarly dressed plump blond woman. The woman was holding a white bundle that was either the world\u0027s largest QTip pad or a wellswaddled baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got a family now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed the photo to Allison, who gave it the same bored onceover she\u0027d given Frank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That means something to me,\" Frank insisted. \"Gets me thinking in a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking care of friends, looking after people that\u0027ve been good to the department—that\u0027s one thing. But throwdowns, and with a lady in the car—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"You really know how to draw the moral line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spread his hands. \"All right. Maybe you don\u0027t want to hear it. I just wanted you to know—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That your partner didn\u0027t share his plans with you,\" I supplied. \"Doesn\u0027t make me feel any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank stared into his empty boots, then sat up and began pulling them back on. \"You don\u0027t understand how it is these days, Mr. Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand two people have been murdered. I understand Tilden Sheckly\u0027s got some illegal business going on which he\u0027s very anxious not to have uncovered. I understand he\u0027s playing you for a fool, giving you the pissant jobs of shaking me down, doing surveillance on the least important places, where Les has already been scared away from. What am I missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s chicken,\" Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank stared at her coldly. \"You don\u0027t know me to say that. You don\u0027t know Sheck or what he\u0027s dealing with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison laughed. \"Like he\u0027s a victim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank\u0027s fists closed up and his eyes became unfocused. Something about his response bothered me. His anger turned into something more like embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walkietalkie on his belt clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and I exchanged looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see two options, Frank. First is you help me out, tell me what\u0027s going on, maybe I can help you get to some people who will listen to your problems. The second option is you let Elgin in on this party and we see where it takes us. Which can you live with easier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison straightened up, smiling slightly, indicating that either option was just fine by her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank stood. He looked around the tossedup cabin one more time, then decided on a third option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the walkietalkie and turned on the volume. \"Yo, Elgin, I\u0027m trying again. I thought I saw something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his finger off the button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You folks got one minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison pouted. It took a look of absolute steel for me to persuade her away from the kitchen counter and out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked past Frank his eyes stayed fixed on the back window. When I turned around in the doorway he was still standing like that, like a soldier at attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison and I hardly spoke on the boat ride back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe docked at Turk\u0027s, thanked Bip for the rental, and sloshed into the store with our lakewater filled shoes. We went our separate ways in the little dusty aisles, then met back at Eustice\u0027s cash register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had nachoflavoured Doritos and a Nehi orange. Don\u0027t ask me why—when I\u0027m stressed and disoriented I pick orange food. Never planned. It just happens. Sort of a dietary mood ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison had a twentyounce bottle of fortified wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the bottle, then at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Death wish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEustice shifted uncomfortably, tried to smile. \"Ya\u0027ll have a nice evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove south, skirting the lake and heading toward the dam. The late afternoon sun was slicing through the tops of the live oaks, making the road furry with shadows and the lake glaring silver. Allison drank her grade A stomach destroyer and pushed my mother\u0027s purple glasses farther up on her nose and watched the scenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only spoke when we failed to take the turn that led back to San Antonio. \"We going somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more stop on the Les SaintPierre tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His body, I hope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused before answering, trying to keep down the irritation. \"He\u0027s alive, Allison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those deputy guys must\u0027ve found him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found the cabin. Knowing Frank and Elgin, they blew the surveillance somehow, let Les spot them before they spotted him. Les got out. He left Frank and Elgin sitting on the place, wondering when he would show up. That means Sheckly didn\u0027t kill Les, doesn\u0027t know where he is, and is anxious to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove over the dam. On the lefthand side the lake stretched out, twisted and glittery and dotted with little red racing boats trailing lines of wake. On the righthand side the dam\u0027s cement walls sloped down to a valley of limestone chunks and tiny scrub brush and a much reduced Medina River, strained of everything except the sludge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les left in a hurry,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was using the cabin as a stopover, someplace to complete his paperwork, collect his funds, settle into his new identity. Since he was flushed out prematurely, he\u0027d need a place to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uhhuh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over. Allison\u0027s head was starting to loosen on her neck, her jaw drifting up and down with the bumps in the road. She was frowning and underneath the purple sunglasses her eyes were closed. The wine bottle was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m angry.\" She said it calmly, her face so relaxed that she almost didn\u0027t look like herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les left you. You can be angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t ask for your permission, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my fingers off the steering wheel. \"No, you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her cheek. \"And I am not crying any tears for that bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe crossed the dam and headed around the east side of the lake. On the side of the road barefoot fishermen were making their way back to their cars. College kids were loading their water skis onto trailers. Allison continued not crying over Les SaintPierre and wiping her cheeks furiously. I kept my eyes on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were almost to the village of Plum Creek before she said, \"So where did he go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he got chased away from his hideyhole before he was ready, where did he go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too dangerous. Hotels remember longterm guests. There\u0027s a high risk he\u0027d randomly run into somebody he knew. And he couldn\u0027t pay the bill without attracting notice—either by leaving a paper trail with a credit card or being conspicuous by using cash. No. More likely he\u0027d pick somebody he trusted to put him up for a while. A best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les has forty thousand of those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But people he\u0027d trust to hide him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julie Kearnes,\" Allison decided. \"Or the Danielses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Danielses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, stretching out her legs and crossing them at the ankles. She stared down at her feet, now bare and white and wrinkled from the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les started out treating them like pets or something. You know—simple folk. They needed to be groomed and cared for. Eventually he started liking their company. Willis is a sweet old fart most of the time, and Miranda\u0027s an angel. And Brent\u0027s a good listener, a little selfdestructive like Les. Les became attached to him pretty quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you and Brent—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison shrugged. \"For the last month or so. I\u0027m not sure Les knew and I\u0027m not sure he would\u0027ve cared if he did. With me and Brent it\u0027s just—it\u0027s not love or anything, sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded like she was trying to reassure me, trying to explain away a minor illness she\u0027d been fighting off. j\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the way Brent sees it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison laughed for the first time since we\u0027d entered Les\u0027 cabin. \"I imagine Brent sees me as some kind of trial to get past. I guess you haven\u0027t spent much time around him, Tres. He\u0027s sweet. He\u0027s also sensitive as a raw blister with all the stuff that\u0027s happened to him, tries to punish himself every time he thinks he might be enjoying life again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeen in his rut so long he\u0027s scared to come out, I guess. Sometimes I can\u0027t stand him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it feels good to be with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s disturbing,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I\u0027ve slept with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Your assessment of who Les trusts enough to hide with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julie Kearnes was killed. And the Danielses—is this phone number what I think it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read her the number on my hand, the last number that had been dialled from Les\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison stared out the side window. It was a quarter mile or so before she said, \"The Danielses\u0027 ranch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it may have been dialled months ago,\" I said, \"before Les disappeared. It may have been an ordinary call to a client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove along, both of us trying to get comfortable with that idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned past the Plum Creek Dairy Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat storage facility was uphill, a good fifty yards from the water. It was a gravel clearing fenced off with chain link and barbed wire with a large drivethrough gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside were storage sheds of corrugated metal and plywood, each just big enough to house a boat on a trailer. When I drove up, the gate was open and a family was hitching up their outboard to a Subaru fourwheeler. Or Mom was doing it anyway. The two kids were making like a trampoline in the backseat and the dad was studying a Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition in the driver\u0027s seat. Allison and I got out and helped Mom get the hitch in place and connect the brake lights. Mom gave us a nice smile and asked if she should just leave the gate open. We said sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLes\u0027 boat shed was A12.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chain and padlock on Les\u0027 shed door were new. Fortunately the back wall of the shed was not. The metal peeled up easily on the bottom, giving us just enough space to crawl underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls of the shed didn\u0027t go all the way to the roof. There was about a foot of space at the top to let in light, enough to see by. Les\u0027 boat was just like Kelly Arguello had said, a twentyfivefooter with a collapsed mast and the deck covered with a blue tarp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tarp was tied on haphazardly but with a lot of knots and enthusiasm. We finally had to cut our way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed onto the aft deck, then gave Allison a hand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bench seats on board were white rubbery material embedded with silver glitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small empty cabin below, a closet really. No way more than one person could fit down there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Allison said. \"So it\u0027s a boat. So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went below and searched. Nothing. On the tank of a tiny toilet was a copy of Time, August three years ago. Not encouraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came back topside Allison was prodding the deck floor with her foot. Whenever she pushed down, the blue plastic showed a square of seams about two feet by two feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life vest compartment,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and I exchanged looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes later we were sitting on the bench with an unearthed ice chest between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a green Igloo big enough to hold two sixpacks. When we opened it there was no beer, though. There were stacks of money. Fiftydollar bills, the same as Milo had paid me with. About fifty thousand dollars\u0027 worth. There was also a computer printout of addresses—some in San Antonio, some in Dallas and Houston. Next to each address was a date. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-36.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
