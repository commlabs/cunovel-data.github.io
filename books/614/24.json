{"id":42607,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. LOAMMI HEARS GOOD NEWS.","content":"On the Monday succeeding, Scott started on his trip with a supply of samples and full instructions. His route extended as far as Cleveland, including Albany and the principal towns in New York State, besides some in Ohio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He traveled slowly, having been told to make a thorough canvass of the places he visited.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was everywhere well received. His bright, pleasant manner made friends, and though sometimes his youth proved at first an obstacle, in a short time he won the confidence of customers. It became clear that he understood his business.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are rather young to represent such a large firm as Tower, Douglas \u0026amp; Co,\" said a careful Scotch merchant in Syracuse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think so myself,\" answered Scott, good-humoredly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have they any other drummers as young?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 203]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so. In fact, I know they have not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did they come to make an exception in your case?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know, unless it was out of kindness.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you don\u0027t think it was because you were extra smart?\" asked the merchant, pointedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Time will show whether I am or not,\" said Scott, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I will ask you a few questions, and then I can judge for myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scott answered these questions freely and intelligently. He seemed to understand the different qualities of the goods he carried, and would not allow himself to make any claims for them that could not be substantiated. As a result, Mr. Cameron bought a large order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I begin to understand why you were selected,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you think the firm was justified.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do. You understand your business, and you make no misrepresentations.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If ever you leave your present place I will give you a position.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you still more. I will remember it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 204]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At Elmira, Scott received the following in a letter from Mr. Douglas, the junior partner: \"You are doing finely. You are beating the record.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This pleased Scott. He did not know whether he had done as well as was anticipated, but this reassured him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two days after Scott started on his mission, Loammi entered the store on a visit instigated by curiosity. It was partly also at the suggestion of his father, who thought through Scott\u0027s influence he might redeem his error and obtain an interest in the invention, which he believed would be very profitable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Entering the store, Loammi looked about him, and finally spoke to a young man near the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is a boy named Scott Walton employed here?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The clerk addressed was a friend of Scott, and guessed who it was that was inquiring about him. He was tempted to play a joke on Loammi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There was a clerk here by that name,\" he answered, slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Isn\u0027t he here now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He left us two or three days since.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has he got another place?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 205]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi brightened up. It seemed too good news to be true. His despised cousin had been discharged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi could not have heard anything that would have pleased him more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know why he was discharged?\" he asked, eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I don\u0027t,\" answered the other, with a twinkle in his eye. \"Do you know him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; he is a distant relation of mine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then perhaps you can judge better than I why he did not give satisfaction.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not at all surprised. He was too fresh. That was the matter with him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear me! How unfortunate!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; he\u0027ll never stay long anywhere. Pa had him in his store for a while—Ezra Little\u0027s store, Eighth Avenue—but he was obliged to send him away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And are you Mr. Little\u0027s son?\" asked the young clerk, with mock deference.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; I am his only son,\" answered Loammi, loftily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear me! I am proud to know you. And I suppose you will some time own the store?\" continued the clerk, inquiringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 206]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Probably, though I am not sure but I may become a lawyer. Do you know where Walton lives?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. There are so many in the store that I know the residences of very few.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi took his departure in a very complacent frame of mind. He had always been jealous of Scott, and the intelligence that he had lost his place was very agreeable to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It so happened that on Broadway he met Seth Lawton, whom he had not seen for a good while. Under ordinary circumstances he would have taken no notice of him, but now he had an object in speaking to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-morning, Mr. Lawton,\" he said, condescendingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, good-morning, Loammi,\" rejoined the old man, who was short-sighted, when he realized who it was that had addressed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where do you think I have been?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sure I cannot tell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have been to the store of Tower, Douglas \u0026amp; Co., to call upon Scott.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed! That was very kind of you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you can imagine my surprise to find that he had been discharged.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 207]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it possible?\" ejaculated Seth, who at once guessed how Loammi had been misled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is a great pity. Perhaps your father will take him back into the store.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think he will. If he don\u0027t do for Tower, Douglas \u0026amp; Co., he won\u0027t do for pa.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But the poor boy must live.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well,\" said Loammi, carelessly, \"he can get a chance to sell papers or—black boots.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Surely your father would not allow his young cousin to sink to that employment.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pa wouldn\u0027t interfere. I have heard him say that he has washed his hands of Scott. If he had behaved himself it would have been different.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor boy! I must see what I can do for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027d better not, Cousin Seth. You are a poor man, and it will be all you can do to look after yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Still, Loammi, consider Scott\u0027s position.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He must look out for himself. I advise you not to call round and ask pa to take him back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must think what I can do for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The old man feels pretty bad,\" thought Loammi. \"Well, they are a good match. For my part I don\u0027t think much of poor relations.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 208]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loammi hurried home to impart the welcome news to his father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you think, pa?\" he burst out. \"Scott\u0027s lost his position.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is this true, Loammi?\" asked his father, in some surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, pa; I went to the store this morning, and one of the clerks told me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know what was the matter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I suppose he was too fresh. Now, I suppose, he will be trying to come back to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I might agree to take him if he would come back on the old terms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t mean it, pa! After he has lost his place, too!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well, I could look after him. He would be worth his board.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One thing, he couldn\u0027t put on any airs after his disgrace. By the way, I met Mr. Lawton on Broadway.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cousin Seth?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did he have anything to say about Scott\u0027s discharge?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He didn\u0027t appear to know anything about it till I told him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 209]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know where Scott boards?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well, he will probably be coming around to see me after a while. I should like to have him, as I want to get at that inventor through him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think there\u0027s money in it, pa?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As I should manage it there might be,\" said his father, cautiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Little looked for Scott from day to day, but three weeks passed and he heard nothing from him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2037/57986.html","bookId":614,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:07:53 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:07:53 AM"}
