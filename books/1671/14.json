He leaned back, feeling stronger with the drink in his hand. “You’ve gone to all this trouble, after all. It’d be a shame to waste a judge’s signature. But I don’t care if you surprise me. I want you to impress me—and it had better be good, or I might well be sending a carriage around to Justice Chase’s house. The impolite hour be damned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well, and thank you,” she said, and the other men in the room hovered closer, huddling nearer to the tense little axis of drama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began: “First, I’d like to thank you for giving me your time and your attention. And second, I must thank Mr. Fowler for being kind enough to make the arrangements which have made my visit possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant, out of patience and full of drink, interjected, “I hope ‘third’ brings us to the point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Third,” she continued, as if she hadn’t heard the naked irritation in his voice, “I am here because the CSA is losing the war, and I don’t want to go down with it. I’m not altruistic, and by your definition I absolutely am a criminal. I have nothing to hide, because all I want is to protect myself. I want to survive the fall of the Confederacy, and whatever comes after it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how do you plan to do that?” Jemison Simms asked, his usual grumpiness tempered by curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I enjoy bargaining, and I do it well; indeed, this is something that Mr. Fowler and I have in common—a deep-seated belief that in the midst of any difficulty, there is a compromise to be found that will benefit all parties.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what do you bring to the table, Miss Haymes?” Grant asked, because he knew better than anyone that political bargaining was just another way of saying “gambling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bring the end of the South’s rebellion. I bring the end of your war—thanks to a weapon the likes of which the world has not yet seen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve already got one of those—a submarine we’ve fished out of New Orleans. Our engineers are having a devil of a time with it, but they say exactly what you’re saying: It could end the war, reestablish the Anaconda plan, choke off their supplies at last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker of annoyance shadowed Haymes’s brow. “I’ve heard of this machine. The papers say it’s a modern marvel, and I have no reason to disbelieve them. But if I understand correctly, you can barely pilot the craft at all, and there’s only the one prototype. If you’re very lucky, you’ll ‘choke them off,’ as you put it, within another year or two at best. More likely three or four, if you ask me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t entirely wrong, and that was the only reason Grant didn’t interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince no one else interrupted, either, she went on. “I can bring you something better. Something faster, and more powerful. Something tested, proven, and catastrophic—something that could end the war in a single battle, if the battle is chosen wisely. Or a single target, depending on your personal commitment to the war’s conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will provide you with this weapon, and it will cost you nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it’ll cost us something,” Simms growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing you value,” she clarified. “I ask for amnesty and immunity with regards to any charges resulting from the Rossville incident in 1878, so that when the Union is ultimately restored, I can rejoin it with a clean slate. No charges, no threats—just the chance to begin again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without a cloud hanging over you?” Simms asked, almost as rude sober as Grant could be while drinking. “That’s what it was, am I correct? Or that’s how I’ve heard it described.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant didn’t have time to hide his confusion. “A cloud?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of gas. Poisonous gas, used on our soldiers. One witness said it looked like an enormous yellow cloud, heavy enough to settle across the compound and kill everyone who breathed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout so much as a penitent lowering of her eyes, Katharine Haymes replied, “Not a bad assessment. That is what it looks like to the uninformed observer, yes—a yellow cloud. But whatever it looks like, Fort Chattanooga demanded a field test, and you can’t seriously think that they would allow me to test it on Confederate soldiers. They were the ones who decided to use prisoners, not me. And once the results hit the papers and telegraph wires, they needed someone to blame for the breach in wartime protocol, so they picked me. The weapon was designed with my money, in my factory, with my scientists and developers. My name was attached from start to finish. I was an easy scapegoat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president found it very difficult to believe that this woman had been anyone’s scapegoat; she struck him as the kind of person who used other people, not the reverse. But she was a woman, it was true; and she was a woman with money, and he’d known plenty of men who didn’t like that combination. He mustered a small sliver of doubt, only to feel it wither and crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued: “I know all too well what the Union thinks of me now, but none of it was my call. I want to make clear that I’m an ally, and I was an American before I was ever declared a Confederate. That’s why I’m requesting formal amnesty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, and made a visible effort to soften herself. “As you must know, it can be difficult for an unmarried woman to survive in this world, in this war. While my father was alive, I could rely on him—never my mother, who passed away when I was a child. So you see? I’ve been alone, without guidance or protection for all of my life. And I’ll be the first to admit I’ve made mistakes. Plenty of them, if you want the truth. But I refuse to allow this one to haunt me through the reconstruction of my nation. I am a patriot, Mr. President, but I have fought for my own survival long enough. It’s time for me to fight for my country: the United States of America.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a pretty way of saying you don’t want to go to prison.” He looked down at his glass. It was empty. He couldn’t remember having taken a single swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it as you like. But I’d like to throw my weight behind the Union, if the Union will have me. I’ll end your war in a fortnight if you’ll let me take charge of the project, or if you’ll allow Mr. Fowler to pursue it on my behalf, with my assistance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a bold claim.” The way Grant said it was just short of an accusation. She couldn’t possibly do any such thing. Could she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a bold program.” She patted Desmond Fowler’s hand. “And it’s a bold man you have on your team, to take such a risk. As for the weapons we’re developing—I could arrange for a demonstration, perhaps. Not soldiers, of course,” she specified. “Maybe dogs, or horses, or—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant was too drunk to keep the horror to himself. “Dear God, woman. If the weapon is half what you claim it is, it ought to be tested in battle—not on dogs, and certainly not horses!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirked at him, and he wanted to punch her—a desire which shamed him even as the thought of it delighted him. The prospect of running a fist into her smug, pretty face. A face that Desmond Fowler could scarcely stop looking at. A lying face. He was as confident of that as the drink in his hand. Except the drink was gone, his glass empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine, then. He wasn’t sure of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well then, Mr. President. I understand your reluctance, and I’m flattered by it. You give me credit for having created something terrible, and I thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuddered. “What an awful thing to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More awful than war itself?” she asked. “Terrible things are necessary sometimes. One might argue that any means to the end of hostilities might call itself a virtue, no matter how frightful the initial cost. If we kill a few thousand people in the South and they tremble before the Union’s military might … then we might save the lives of tens of thousands more. How many have died already, Mr. President?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More than tens of thousands. Hundreds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hundreds from battle alone, or hundreds more from the disease, terror, and famine that comes in a war’s wake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could not say.” He did not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’ve seen it yourself. You know the war better than anyone, and I do not think that you love it. I believe you want to see it concluded, in order to begin the long work of reconstructing the nation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had him there. “I hate the war. If I could end it tomorrow, I would do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was both sharper and more frightening than a line of bayonets, and Grant had walked right into it. “Then we do agree after all. I do think we can work together, Mr. President. I’ll end your war if you let me. I’ll give you back your country, in exchange for a clean reputation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, not to argue with her but because she was asking for more than he could offer. Immunity from prosecution? That was easy enough to come by; he could hand it over with a signature. But should he? He did not believe her when she’d called herself a scapegoat. He did not believe that she’s unknowingly been party to a war crime, and he did not believe that she wanted nothing else from him—nothing at all. But if he asked her now, she’d only lie some more, and he was too drunk to sort out the particulars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing else he could say. He could either play along and pretend he was running the show, or he could fight and lose, and then everyone would know how weak he’d truly become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to think, these men wanted him to run for another term. But he hadn’t fought that, either. He’d missed his chance. And now, he was on a ballot, in a yellow oval, in a white house, in a cage of his own making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he survive a fourth term? Would he want to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up without another word, set his glass down on the sideboard by the door, and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not stumble until he was around the corner, so no one saw it, thank God; except then Jemison Simms stuck his head out to ask, “Mr. President?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant did not turn around, only waved and said, “I’m fine. Leave me alone. I need to think.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fiddlehead-the-clockwork-century-5/page-14.html","bookId":1671,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM"}
