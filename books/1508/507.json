Finding Lin Ming is the most important matter.” Mu Chihuo took out two sound transmitting talismans. In this broken world, sound transmitting talismans were suppressed by the laws of this world. They could also be blocked by enchantments, array formations, and all sorts of other barriers. Mu Chihuo pegged his hopes on the possibility that Lin Ming wasn’t too far from them, and that there also wasn’t a barrier blocking the sound transmitting talisman.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Chihuo flicked his fingers and the two sound transmitting talismans burned. “Lin Ming, Mu Qianyu, I know that you two are together.

Then, Mu Qingshu turned the hourglass. This hourglass was enough to measure one hour.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Mu Qingshu turned over the hourglass, he looked over at Mu Bingyun, his eyes flashing with a hideously lascivious light. At this stage, Mu Qingshu had already gone completely insane; he no longer cared about any consequences.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the sand ran out, he turned over the hourglass again. Like this, two hours had passed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qingyi’s heart was in chaos. Zhang Zhen also felt like an ant in a hot pot. But as for Mu Bingyun, she was expressionless as she sat down in meditation, saving her strength for the final battle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Bingyun was well aware that whether Lin Ming and Mu Qianyu came back or not, fighting was inevitable. At that time, how many people would survive was unknown.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lei Jingtian really wished to be ruthless, the lower level martial artists wouldn’t even have the qualifications to escape. Even if everyone split up in separate directions and ran, all Lei Jingtian would have to do was send down a massive net of Disenchanting Dream Light, and every martial artist below the Revolving Core realm would instantly fall unconscious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the hourglass turned for the third time, the Divine Phoenix Island disciples grew increasingly nervous. In the face of a battle at death’s door, very few were able to remain calm like Mu Bingyun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen the third hourglass was halfway finished, at the end of the temple ruins, the figure of a man and a woman suddenly appeared…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Mu Chihuo saw this, he shot up.

His eyes swept past the two figures, and he immediately laughed. They were too stupid, he had never seen someone so stupid before! They had wasted so much energy and strained themselves to escape, but had actually returned to die just because they cared for others. They really were idiots of a completely different caliber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as for those from Divine Phoenix Island, as Mu Qingyi and Lin Ming saw Mu Qianyu appear, she was filled with guilt and regret. She already decided that as soon as the battle began, she would completely combust her blood essence and also swallow the Scarlet Blood Pill as penance for her sins.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Bingyun traced the spatial ring on her left hand. Her mind was already connected to the Blue Luan Sword; she was only waiting for the battle to begin.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha! You are such an idiot!” Mu Qingshu savagely laughed, “You really came to die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming came, then they had a chance to live. Even if they couldn’t obtain the first eight layers of the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’, they would profit as long as they obtained his Divine Phoenix bloodline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lin Ming arrived 300 feet away, he stood firm and held the Great Desolate Blood Halberd in his hands. He was expressionless as he kept the halberd blade pointed at the floor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBeside Lin Ming, Mu Qianyu had taken out the Vermillion Bird Sword.

You clearly knew that coming here meant death, but you still stepped into this trap. Since you’re such an idiot, let this old man help you along.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLei Jingtian’s arms shook, and purple electric light appeared atop his hands.
