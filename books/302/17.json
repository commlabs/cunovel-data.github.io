HOW ROSE FARED.","content":"\u0026nbsp;We return to Rose, who found herself very unwillingly once more in the custody of her stepfather. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go out and play in the back yard with Fanny,\" said Mrs. Waters. \"You\u0027ll have a nice time together, and be good friends in less than no time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose followed Fanny slowly into the back yard; but she had very little hope of a good time. She was too full of sorrowful thoughts for that. As she looked back, a moment after going into the yard, she saw Mr. Martin shaking his fist at her from the back window, and this she understood very well was a sign of the treatment which she had to expect.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The back yard was not a very pleasant place. It was very small to begin with, and the little space was littered with broken bottles and rubbish of various kinds. In one corner was a cistern nearly full of water, which had been standing long enough to become turbid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What shall we do?\" asked Fanny.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Rose, without much interest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll tell you,\" said Fanny, \"we\u0027ll take a piece of wood, and sail it in the cistern. We can make believe it\u0027s a ship.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can do it,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t you play too?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t feel much like playing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why don\u0027t you?\" asked Fanny, curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish I was back in New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who were you with?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With Rufie.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who\u0027s he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My brother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is he a nice boy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, he\u0027s the nicest boy that ever lived,\" said Rose, positively.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your father says he\u0027s a bad boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He isn\u0027t my father.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Isn\u0027t your father?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, he\u0027s only my stepfather.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose was about to say something against Mr. Martin; but it occurred to her that if it came to the ears of the latter, she might fare the worse for it, and accordingly she stopped short.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fanny picked up a stick, and began to sail it about in the cistern. After a while Rose went up, and looked on rather listlessly. At length Fanny got tired of this amusement, and began to look around for something better to do. In the corner of the yard she spied the cat, who was lying down in a lazy attitude, purring contentedly as she dozed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know what I\u0027ll do,\" she said; \"I\u0027ll have some fun with puss.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She lifted the sleepy cat, and conveyed her straightway to the cistern. This attracted the attention of Rose, who exclaimed, \"What are you going to do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am going to see puss swim,\" said the mischievous girl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Rose had a tender heart, and could not bear to see an animal abused. It always aroused all the chivalry in her nature, and her indignation in the present case overcame not only her timidity, but the depression she had felt at the separation from her friends.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You shan\u0027t do it,\" she said, energetically.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mind your business!\" said Fanny, defiantly. \"It\u0027s my cat, and I\u0027m going to put her into the water.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n True to her declaration, she dropped the cat into the cistern.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose waited for no more, but ran to the cistern, and, pushing Fanny forcibly away, seized the cat by her neck, and pulled her out. Puss, on being rescued, immediately took to her heels, and soon was out of harm\u0027s way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you do that for?\" exclaimed Fanny, flaming with rage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You had no right to put the cat in the water,\" retorted Rose, intrepidly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll put you in the water,\" said Fanny. \"I wish you were drowned.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re a bad girl,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I won\u0027t play with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want you to. I don\u0027t care about playing with a girl that behaves so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I behave as well as you do, anyway.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you any more.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This seemed to exasperate Fanny, who, overcome by her feelings, flew at Rose, and scratched her in the face. Rose was very peaceably inclined, but she did not care about submitting to such treatment. She therefore seized Fanny by the hands and held them. Unable to get away, Fanny screamed at the top of her voice. This brought her mother to the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s going on here?\" she asked, in a voice of authority.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She\u0027s fighting me,\" said Fanny. \"Take her away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let go my child at once, you wicked girl!\" said Mrs. Waters, whose sympathies were at once enlisted on the side of her child.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then she mustn\u0027t scratch me,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you scratch her for, Fanny?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She\u0027s been plaguing me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How did she plague you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was playing with puss, and she came and took the cat away, and pushed me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are a bad, quarrelsome girl,\" said Mrs. Waters, addressing Rose, \"and I\u0027m sorry I told your father you might come here. He told me you were bad; but I didn\u0027t think you would show out so quick. If you were my girl, I\u0027d give you a good whipping. As it is, I shall inform your father of your conduct, as soon as he gets home, and I have no doubt he will punish you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I only tried to prevent Fanny from drowning the cat,\" said Rose. \"She threw her into the water, and I took her out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s a likely story. I don\u0027t believe it. Is it true, Fanny?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" said Fanny, whose regard for truth was not very strong.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So I supposed. You have not only ill-treated my girl, but you have told a wrong story besides. Fanny, come in, and I will give you a piece of cake.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You won\u0027t give her any, will you, ma?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, she don\u0027t deserve any.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a look of triumph Fanny went into the house, leaving poor Rose to meditate in sorrow upon this new phase of injustice and unhappiness. It seemed as if everybody was conspiring to injure and ill-treat her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish Rufie were here,\" she said, \"so that he might take me away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then came to her mind the threat of her stepfather, and she shuddered at the idea of Rufus being killed. From what she knew of Mr. Martin, she didn\u0027t think it very improbable that he would carry out his threat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After a while she was called to dinner, but she had very little appetite.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you\u0027re sullen, are you, miss?\" said Mrs. Waters. \"You\u0027re a bad girl, and if I were your father, I\u0027d give you a lesson. So you won\u0027t eat!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am not hungry,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I understand very well what that means. However, if you don\u0027t want to eat, I won\u0027t make you. You\u0027ll be hungry enough by and by, I guess.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The afternoon passed very dismally to poor Rose. Fanny was forbidden by her mother to play with her, though this Rose didn\u0027t feel at all as a privation. She was glad to be free from the company of the little girl whom she had begun to dislike, and spent her time in brooding over her sorrowful fate. She sat by the window, and looked at the people passing by, but she took little interest in the sight, and was in that unhappy state when the future seems to contain nothing pleasant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At length Mr. Martin came home. His nose was as radiant as ever, and there was little doubt that he had celebrated his capture in the manner most agreeable to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you\u0027re here, are you?\" he said. \"I thought you wouldn\u0027t run away after what I told you. It\u0027ll be a bad day for you and your rascal of a brother if you do. What have you been doing?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sitting by the window.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where\u0027s the other little girl? Why don\u0027t you go and play with her, instead of moping here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t like her,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Pears to me you\u0027re mighty particular about your company,\" said Martin. \"Maybe she don\u0027t like you any better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To this Rose didn\u0027t reply; but Mrs. Waters, who just then chanced to enter the room, did.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your little girl abused my Fanny,\" she said; \"and I had to forbid them playing together. I found them fighting together out in the back yard.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It wasn\u0027t my fault,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t tell me that,\" said Martin. \"I know you of old, miss. You\u0027re a troublesome lot, you and your brother; but now I\u0027ve got you back again, I mean to tame you; see if I don\u0027t.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you will,\" said Mrs. Waters; \"my Fanny is a very sweet-dispositioned child, just like what I was at her age; and she never gets into no trouble with nobody, unless they begin to pick on her, and then she can\u0027t be expected to stand still, and be abused.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course not,\" said Martin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your little girl attacked her, and tried to stop her playing with the cat.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you do that for, miss?\" said Mr. Martin, menacingly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She threw the cat into the cistern,\" said Rose; \"and I was afraid she would drown.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What business was it of yours? It wasn\u0027t your cat, was it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was my daughter\u0027s cat,\" said Mrs. Waters; \"but she tells me she didn\u0027t throw her into the cistern. It\u0027s my belief that your little girl did it herself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just as likely as not,\" said Martin, with a hiccough. \"Hark you, miss,\" he continued, steadying himself by the table on which he rested his hand, for his head was not altogether steady, \"I\u0027ve got something to say to you, and you\u0027d better mind what I say? Do you hear?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose didn\u0027t answer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you hear, I say?\" he demanded, in a louder tone, frowning at the child.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027d better, then, just attend to your own business, for you\u0027ll find it best for yourself. You\u0027ve begun to cut up your shines pretty early. But you don\u0027t do it while I\u0027m here. What are you snivelling about?\"—for Rose, unable to repress her sorrow, began to sob. \"What are you snivelling about, I say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want to go back, and live with Rufie and Miss Manning,\" said Rose. \"Oh, do let me go!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s a pretty cool request,\" said Martin. \"After I\u0027ve been so long hunting you up, you expect me to let you go as soon as I\u0027ve got you. I don\u0027t mean to let you go back to Rufie,\" he said, mimicking the little girl\u0027s tone,—\"not if I know it. Besides,\" he added, with a sudden thought, \"I couldn\u0027t do it very well if I wanted to. Do you know where your precious brother is?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where?\" asked Rose, in alarm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Over to Blackwell\u0027s Island. He was took up this morning for stealing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" said Rose, indignantly. \"I know he wouldn\u0027t steal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, well, have it your own way, then. Perhaps you know better than I do. Only I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not where he is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of course this story was all a fabrication, invented to tease poor Rose. Though the little girl didn\u0027t believe it, she feared that Rufus might have got into some trouble,—some innocent persons are sometimes unjustly suspected,—and the bare possibility of such a thing was sufficient to make her feel unhappy. Poor child! But yesterday she had been full of innocent joy and happiness, and now everything seemed dark and sorrowful. When should she see Rufie again? That was the anxious thought that kept her awake half the night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82750.html","bookId":302,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:54:14 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:54:14 AM"}
