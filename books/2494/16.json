It wouldn\u0027t exactly elicit sympathy for Zondorae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the chief who had an attitude and said, \"He would take away the Song of Death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, Hart!\" Jonesy said, \"been studying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I had. The deal was that I wanted to know what the things were that I raised. Knowledge was power. My parents had been right about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief nodded, bending to pick up Zondorae who threw up from the smell. Chief whipped it off himself with a casual swipe of his hand and it splattered to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher stepped around the mess with distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief threw Zondorae in a chair, Gramps put the tip of the bloodied wrench under his chin and said, \"Speak,\" like Zondorae was a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Onyx received better treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was weeping, trying unsuccessfully to cradle his mangled toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop being a sissy, an Organic can fix ya right up,\" Gramps paused then said, \"later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you know?\" he wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think I knew what to do?\" Gramps asked and I gave him a sharp look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, Gramps had been tortured?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze slid to mine and I knew more than I had. All of it was bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZondorae spoke, between hiccuping sobs, weeping and flailing around. He told us the Graysheet Plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was worse than we had supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t it always?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh was the first to break the silence. \"Why would you sterilize me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZondorae\u0027s eyes met hers. \"Yours was a special dose.\" His watering and swollen eyes took in the group of guys and Tiff. \"It\u0027s for your own good. There\u0027s no way to alter your genetic code. We can inhibit the manifestation through a booster,\" he said then coughed and shuddered, moaning and holding his feet. \"But we can\u0027t have the breeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike we were goddamned cattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker clenched his fists. \"You think that you can stop the paranormals from having children? Are you insane?\" I narrowed my eyes, his anger seemed feigned to me. Off. But Zondorae distracted me from further reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZondorae nodded, arrogance rearing its ugly head like a slip showing underneath a skirt. \"We know we can. We have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief twitched, his tomahawk moving without a word. Zondorae\u0027s eyes widened at the blade; rusted but effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" I said casually and Chief gave me a look, backing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh smirked. \"Lots of action, no conversation,\" she observed, flicking a strand of inky black hair behind her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I replied, my eyes never leaving Zondorae. \"The Skopamish are my favorites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can kill me, but the wheels are in motion. You will be shut down, your powers- gone.\" He looked at me. \"You should be happy, Hart. Who wants to raise the dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know, I was kinda used to it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be allowed to have children. Period. Once we knew...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought you\u0027d play God,\" Nevaeh growled, her body vibrating with her anger as more zombies arose from the wet ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was great timing because the Graysheets silently pulled up in their black, unmarked SUVs, pulse-fueled, state-of-the-art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary Zondorae grinned as his pals showed up to save the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to smash his teeth down his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, the three of us necromancers opened a can of whoop ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy smokes,\" Jonesy said as the Graysheets stepped out of their vehicles, guns naked in their hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will definitely not improve neighbor relations,\" Archer commented dryly while Zondorae chortled in the background, \"Over here!\" His voice broke on the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one in front looked at Parker, taking in the fifteen zombies behind him and said in greeting, \"Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not what it seems,\" Parker responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the crooked mouth. In the middle of death staring us in the face, guns and the prospect of never having children, I felt like laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical reaction to Bad Shit Coming Down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get this straight,\" the agent said, taking in a bleeding and barely coherent Zondorae. \"I recognize torture techniques when I see them and a rogue agent. Don\u0027t try to turn the tables.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZondorae stood favoring his pulverized foot. \"Kill them. They know everything, the reversal, the sterilization. They know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent sighed, raising his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy crooked mouth slipped when he shot Gary Zondorae between the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit,\" Alex whispered as Zondorae slumped to the floor and began to bleed out. The pool of red flowed toward the drain Gramps had installed when the place was built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker looked at the agent, casually turning away from the murdered scientist. \"Listen Brewster, I\u0027m all for him going....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a new plan, Parker,\" Brewster said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was suddenly there. Which made me want to puke, her terrible vulnerability in the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t stay in the house,\" I said quietly as Parker and Brewster squared off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to kill us,\" she said with an intense certainty that tightened my guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t wait for verification, I grabbed Nevaeh, her bony hand like fragile twigs in my grasp and we called everything that would respond and things that wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I thought siphoning off Tiff had been a rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pool of our power was a crushing slip of energy that left us in a hot ripple of death that flowed out in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the Null before he tried to shut us down and John was suddenly there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at me, his bronzed hair like a low flame in the late dim of dusk. \"I have this, Caleb,\" he said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung my face away from him as the bullets fired, trying to cut us down even as we kept summoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur zombies moved like a wall of dead flesh in front of us without being invited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead needed no such invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came, their bodies jerking as they shielded us from the barrage of bullets. My soul cringed as I delivered my zombies up for massacre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt somehow wrong yet it was all we could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh turned her head like we were moving in a slow motion dance underwater and reached out to Parker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slide of deadly power, linked by our affinity, brought all the death that remained to heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe fell to our knees as Brewster pressed the gun barrel to Parker\u0027s bowed head, execution-style. Parker remained under the weight of somnolent awe of the death energy that had brought us low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief stepped into the agent\u0027s path, smoothly swinging the tomahawk and took Brewster\u0027s hand off at the wrist. After a heartbeat or two, the veins that had retreated by the hack now began to flow in earnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to stagger around in a jerky stumble as his raw end pumped his lifeblood on Gramps\u0027 driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade moaned at my back, clearly not feelin\u0027 the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen dead came from five miles away I saw another relative I hadn\u0027t expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother,\" Gramps breathed, dropping the bloodied wrench on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGran had definitely gotten her groove on and was back with her head in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave a shouting bark that sounded alarmingly like laughter combined with a cry and realized that hysteria was a pace away from me, waiting to consume me in an instant if I let it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Jade\u0027s small and warm hand press on my back and shuddered underneath her blind faith that she poured into me. She was fragile in stature, but never in her interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was my rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me what she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was enough; my head started clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood and I hauled up my compatriots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at the Zondorae\u0027s corpse and with a small tap of power I raised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood smoothly, the power of the three of us cleanly knitting his wounds into a sublime kind of perfection and he gave a small bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touché, Caleb Hart. I\u0027m here to serve,\" Gary said, his voice like a low growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said and beckoned him forward. He shambled forward quickly, like a spider walking upright. His mangled toes caused a little bit of a balance problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now... that\u0027s just wrong,\" Jonesy said as the zombies hacked and the Graysheets shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping Jonesy wasn\u0027t having a moment of regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it,\" Alex said, tossing a Graysheet armed with only a knife about seven meters away, his powerful body doing a slight swivel that sent the agent flying like a low human airplane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies, some with separated limbs, some headless, never quit. They kept coming in waves and in various stages of rot and pieces. Their missing limbs trembled across the surface of the ground to get to the enemy. The sheer numbers overwhelmed the paltry force of the Graysheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I knew that something was desperately wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Graysheets simply didn\u0027t do small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t long before we found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chucked the bodies inside their vehicles. Actually, it was more like a scrape and stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Ss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade began to gag. I\u0027d had to just ignore my need to comfort her because of my need to get the agents hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more work, Caleb,\" Parker said, heaving an agent in the rig by the legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eww... they\u0027re just staring,\" Sophie said, peeking at the zombie horde from between her fingers. Jonesy snorted. \"You ought to be immune now, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff rolled her eyes, snapping a bubble while eyeing Gran. I\u0027m sure the event from a few years ago where Gran had tossed Bry and her around might be a little fresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished and the zombies closed in, sensing us, needing us. Their hands flowed over our clothing and we stood while they drew energy from us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it just leak out?\" Nevaeh asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what she meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.
