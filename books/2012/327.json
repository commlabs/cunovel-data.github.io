If they came for us now, these lizard warriors, we would fall like myrid to the neck-hooks. If they came for us now, I would have to awaken the Wolves. But … the footfall of gods upon the land shall summon like drums of war. Power draws power – too soon, too far away .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill … I wonder. Why do they not attack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to see Tanakalian approaching. Another audience. Shall I drive him to his knees again, humiliate him? No. That can wait . She set off to take the two of them a fair distance from the camp, well beyond earshot. Still … treachery in his heart .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven before he caught up to her he began speaking. ‘Destriant, you must understand. The Perish are bound by strict rules of behaviour. It is this discipline which gives us our strength.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are destroying this army, Shield Anvil.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The K’Chain Che’Malle—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Have already caught up to us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened, but for once he did not question her. ‘The Wolves must be sent against them, Destriant! We cannot hope to—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now that our soldiers can barely stand, no, you’re right: we cannot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew himself up. ‘This threat was ever present in my mind, Destriant. It was my hope that the K’Chain Che’Malle would be content with escorting the Letherii and Bolkando. But I knew that I could not gamble the lives of my brothers and sisters on that assumption. This is why I drove my soldiers as hard as I did – we must reach the safety of the Forkrul Assail as soon as possible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But you have failed to do so, Shield Anvil. And what manner of welcome, do you imagine, will the Assail accord us when we arrive with an army already half-dead?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pale and she could see the venom in his eyes. ‘I had no choice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were impatient, Shield Anvil. You exulted in your betrayal and in so doing you revealed your true nature too soon – your once-allies know the truth of you now. And they have had time to adjust their tactics.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This is Krughava’s fault! All of it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There shall be no more executions, Shield Anvil. Worse, your denial of their embrace has made a mockery of your title. I look upon you and I can see, at last, the path that led to the Forkrul Assail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock twisted his face. ‘What does that mean? I am sworn to the Wolves of Winter!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are drunk on justice, Shield Anvil, and for all that you imagine you walk a straight line, in truth you stumble and weave. Now you stand before me, deluded in your righteousness, and upon the path where you walked’ – she gestured back towards the bodies in the trench – ‘the corpses of the innocent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The delusions,’ he said in a low rasp, ‘are not mine, child.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetoc smiled. ‘Go on. I am intrigued.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you truly believe you can withstand the will of the Forkrul Assail? We shall be brought to heel – but that is not how it was supposed to be. Their aims are petty compared to ours. For all their claims, Destriant, the truth is, I intended to use them. They demand that we kneel? So be it. It matters not. The Wolves are blind to all of this – we think in ways they cannot comprehend, and this game will not be won with slavering jaws and berserk rage. Against us, that has never worked . No, the Wolves of Winter are better off hiding in the forest, in the dark shadows. Leave us to do what must be done, and when all the players are weakened, then shall come the time for our gods to attack – after all, is that not the way of the wolves in the wild?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tanakalian,’ said Setoc, ‘I agree with you. But alas, I cannot choose the times when the gods speak through me. I will have no control over their power the day it steals my will. Their anger will overwhelm, and through their eyes they will see nothing but blood.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is not how to fight a war.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped forward, a sudden hope in his eyes. ‘Then you must work with me, Destriant! We can win this – win it in truth! Warn the Wolves – if they manifest, within reach of the Forkrul Assail, they will be murdered . Or worse, enslaved.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then stand before me now as a true Shield Anvil. It is not for you to judge, not for you to deny your brothers and sisters. And above all, it is not for you to take their lives.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanakalian pointed back to the bodies in the trench. ‘They would have deserted, Destriant. They would have fled back to Krughava, carrying with them vital information. Their crime was treason.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They sought to raise a new Mortal Sword,’ she said. ‘For the field of battle, they sought a veteran to command them. You killed them because of a personal slight, Tanakalian.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-327.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
