Then we can be finished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there and stared at her in disbelief. “Umm, don’t you want to fuck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never had a penis in me before. I’m not ready for that yet. But I’ll suck your cock until you come. That’s what I always do to guys and they don’t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis girl was weird and I was losing my hard-on faster than the speed of light. “You know what? Just forget it. I’ve lost the mood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I’m positive,” I said with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to get out of there quickly. I pulled up my pants, buttoned them, opened the door, and quickly walked down the hallway back to the bar. Alexis followed quickly behind me. When I reached the bar, Aiden held up his hand to high-five me. I shot him a look as I sat down at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bro, what’s wrong? Didn’t you score?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to talk about it. That chick is weird. I need a drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held up my hand to get the bartender’s attention and then ordered a double scotch. Aiden was eyeing some girl over in the corner and finally got up the nerve to go talk to her. As I downed my scotch, I heard Alexis from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to go, Collin. We’re hitting another club. One we’re more familiar with. Do you want to come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m good right here. Have fun.” I smiled and secretly wished that she’d get the hell away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, thanks again for....well, you know.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a fake smile back and she and her friends disappeared. I rolled my eyes as I ordered another scotch. A while later, Aiden came up to me and told me that he was taking the girl he’d met home and that he could drop me off at the beach house first. I told him that I wasn’t ready to leave and that I’d catch a cab home. I wasn’t anywhere near drunk enough to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful night for a walk on the beach. I needed to think and clear my head, and walking along the water always helped. It was dark out, but the way the moonlight glistened over the ocean water was magical. I looked around at some of the boxes stacked in the kitchen and my eyes filled with tears. It was an exhausting day and I needed to relax. If that was even possible anymore. I walked out the patio door and hit the warm sand. The light breeze that swept across my face felt calming, and as I took in a deep breath of the salt water air, I began to relax. The water swept across my feet as I held up my dress so the bottom didn’t get wet. The water was my life at one time, and now, it was just a distant memory that filled my heart with sadness and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walked, I couldn’t stop looking up at the stars in the sky. Orion shined brightly. My star gazing came to an end when I tripped over something and fell to the ground. After I realized what I’d done, I looked at the man I’d tripped over. He was lying face down in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me. Are you okay? I didn’t see you. It was completely my fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer me, so I poked him. “Hey, are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t move and I started to panic. I inched my way closer to him and rolled him on his back. His faced glowed in the moonlight and I couldn’t help but stare at him. I leaned closer and put my ear to his mouth to make sure he was breathing. His breath reeked of alcohol and that was when I knew he was passed out. I got up, brushed the sand off my dress, and started walking away. Could I just leave him there like that? I pondered with the thought of trying to wake him up and asking him where he lived. Oh well, if he drank that much that he passed out in the sand, then that was where he belonged. I began walking back in the direction I came and stopped when I heard him moan. I turned around and stared at him lying there, in the sand, drunk and helpless. I walked back over to him and shook him by the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, you need to wake up now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and looked at me. “Who are you?” he slurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone who tripped over you. You’re lucky I didn’t break anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, my fucking head. The beach is spinning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s what you get for drinking so much. Are you from around here?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head and then pointed up to the house that wasn’t too far from where we were at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s your house? Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head as he tried to sit up, but then fell back down. “Come on; let’s get you home,” I said as I tried to pick him up. “Okay, you’re going to have to help me. Get on your knees and I’ll grab your arms to help you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did what I asked and I carefully helped him up. He stumbled and almost knocked both of us over. But I held on tight. I put my arm around his waist and his arm around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just take slow small steps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you doing this?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To be honest, I don’t know. I couldn’t just leave you all night on the sand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept stumbling and complaining that he felt sick. I told him that he better not throw up or I’d drop him and he could spend the night outside. When we made it up to the patio, I opened the door and helped him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to go now. You’ll be safe here in your house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from me and gave me a small wave before he tripped up the steps and lay there. I rolled my eyes as I walked over to him and helped him climb up the stairs one by one. When we reached the top of the stairs, I asked him which room was his. He pointed straight ahead. I helped him to his bedroom and made sure he lay down on the bed. He yawned, and when I went to walk away, he grabbed hold of my hand. I turned around and looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lightly smiled as I put my hand on top of his. “I bet you say that to all the girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of the room and felt the hand he grabbed. It felt like he was still holding it. I could still feel his soft fingers wrapped around my hand. Before leaving, I stopped in the family room and looked at the numerous pictures that were displayed all over the room. His mom was beautiful and his dad was extremely handsome. Now I could see where he got his good looks from. His sister was beautiful as well. Looking at what a beautiful family they were tore my heart to pieces. Tears began to swell in my eyes as I headed back to my house as fast as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” I moaned as I rolled over and tried to open my eyes. I lay there on top of the comforter, fully dressed, wondering how the hell I got here. As I moved my hand across the bed, I felt something. Sand. How the hell did sand get in here? Shit, I hated when I drank so much that I couldn’t remember. I dragged myself out the bed and down the stairs to make a cup of coffee. I looked at the clock and it was noon. I popped a k-cup in the Keurig, grabbed a mug from the cupboard, and hit the brew button. I kept shaking my head because I kept smelling the scent of roses. I looked around the kitchen, trying to figure out where it was coming from, but there weren’t any roses to be found. I grabbed hold of my shirt and held it up to my nose. Sure enough, it was on me. What the hell happened last night? I took my cup, went upstairs, and took a shower. When I was finished, I picked up my shirt from the floor and sniffed it one more time before throwing it in my bag. The smell was nice. It was the scent that a woman would wear. Maybe some kind of perfume or lotion. Who was I with? I sighed as I made another cup of coffee and took it outside and down to the beach, where I stood and watched the waves crash against the shore. I took my phone from my pocket and looked at the date. Today was Hailey’s birthday. I wasn’t going to let it bother me and I wasn’t going to send her a text message either. She’d moved on, I’d moved on, and after everything that happened, we couldn’t be friends. As I stared at my phone, I heard a voice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-15.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
