I think she\u0027s going to need a transfusion right quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista hesitated, reluctant to let anyone else look after her. His own blood was far stronger than the blood of mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, he met Duncan \u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" the bounty hunter said. \"Are you sure that\u0027s what she\u0027d want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He knew it wasn\u0027t what she wanted, but what he wanted. He carried Victoria to the car and got in, cradling her in his arms while Duncan drove to the hospital. The cuff on her left wrist burned even through his clothing where her arm rested against his chest, but it didn\u0027t matter. Nothing mattered now but saving her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunter\u0027s Camaro was old and beat up, but it hauled. Duncan pulled into the hospital emergency parking lot five minutes later. Leaving the motor running, he hopped out of the car and opened the door for Battista, then turned and ran into the building, hollering for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orderly hurried out with a gurney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio was reluctant to surrender Victoria \u0027s care to anyone else, but he placed her gently on the gurney, then followed the orderly inside. Duncan was standing at the nurse\u0027s station, filling out the required paperwork, explaining that she\u0027d had an accident on the highway out of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping around a corner, Battista dissolved into mist, then went into the examining room where they had taken Victoria. The doctors and nurses worked quickly, washing and stitching the raw wound in her neck while another nurse set up the necessary equipment to replace the blood Falco had taken. He wondered what the medics would think if they knew what had really happened to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in his incorporeal state hovering unseen near the ceiling, he was not immune to the scent of blood. It enveloped him, arousing his hunger, making it difficult to remain in his inhuman form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened to the quiet conversation of the doctors and nurses as they worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween asking for instruments and calling out Victoria \u0027s vital signs, they speculated on how she had received the wound in her throat and why there were manacles on her wrists and ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Car accident indeed,\" the doctor said. \"More like some sort of sex game that went wrong.\" Removing his gloves, he stepped away from the table. \"I think you\u0027d better call the police first thing in the morning. They\u0027ll want to talk to her when she wakes up. And see if you can get hold of a locksmith to come over and get those cuffs off her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, Victoria was tucked into a hospital bed between crisp white sheets. A locksmith had removed the shackles from her wrists and ankles, ointment had been applied to the abrasions they had left on her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista stood beside her bed, his hand holding one of hers. Her color looked a little better, her breathing was less labored. Her hair framed her face like a fiery halo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe vanished from sight each time a nurse came in to check Victoria \u0027s blood pressure, reappeared the minute they left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remained by her side through the remaining hours of the night. As dawn threatened to chase the darkness from the sky, he brushed a kiss across her cheek, whispered that he loved her, and hastened to his resting place before the sun could find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki woke slowly, confused by the pungent aromas that flooded her nostrils. Her bed felt strange, her throat hurt, she couldn\u0027t move her left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening her eyes, she stared at her surroundings—the pale green walls, the small TV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esitting on a corner shelf, the bandages on her wrists, the IV dripping down a tube into her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. What was she doing in a hospital?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came back to her in a rush. She had admitted Falco into her home. He had drugged her and abducted her. Things were a little hazy after that. She remembered being locked in a cellar, her arms chained to a wall, remembered Falco\u0027s voice whispering in her ear, describing in dark detail precisely what he intended to do to her. She had seen it all vividly in her mind as he told her exactly how he would drink from her every night until she no longer had the strength or the will to resist him. It would be painful, he said, beyond any pain she had ever known. He would consume her blood and with it all her memories until she was nothing but an empty husk, and then he would flood her mind with his wants, his desires. She would be his slave, subject to his every whim, until she no longer pleased him, and then he would drain her dry and cast her aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen my minions,\" Falco had said, gesturing at the four creatures who did his bidding. \"That\u0027s what you will become.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki covered her mouth with her hand, stifling a cry of horror as she imagined herself as one of those pitiful creatures. She had to get out of here, had to leave town before Falco tricked her again. Next time she might not be so lucky…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. How had she gotten here? She didn\u0027t remember escaping from Falco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still puzzling over the matter when Bobbie Sue and Duncan entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re awake,\" Bobbie Sue said brightly. \"How are you feeling, hon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was so worried about you.\" Bobbie Sue thrust the bouquet in her hands into a pitcher of water. \"Thank goodness they found you in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue dropped into the hard plastic chair beside the bed. \"Tom and Antonio charged into Falco\u0027s hideaway like the Lone Ranger and Tonto and rescued you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki looked at Tom, a question in her eyes. \"The two of you? Together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You should have seen us,\" he said, grinning. \"We wiped out Falco\u0027s zombies, grabbed you, and then burned the place down. He wont be going back there any time soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed them, the zombies?\" Vicki asked. True, they had been under Falco\u0027s spell, but once they had been human, with all the same hopes and dreams as everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t there some way to save them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shook his head. \"No. Believe me, they\u0027re better off dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Antonio? Is he all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was fine, last I saw him,\" Duncan said. Moving up behind Bobbie Sue, he placed his hands on her shoulders. \"We think you should come and stay with us when you get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Bobbie Sue said, covering Duncan \u0027s hand with one of her own. \"It isn\u0027t safe for you to be home alone as long as that monster is on the loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki glanced from Tom to Bobbie Sue. \"Stay with the two of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint blush rose in Bobbie Sue\u0027s cheeks. \"Yes, well, Tom\u0027s living with me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, it\u0027s kind of sudden,\" Bobbie Sue said with a shrug, \"but after what\u0027s been happening the last couple of weeks, I realized life\u0027s too short and uncertain not to grab what you want with both hands.\" Glancing over her shoulder, she looked up at Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy for you,\" Vicki murmured. \"For both of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, can we bring you anything?\" Bobbie Sue asked. \"A nightgown? One of Gus\u0027s cheeseburgers? A chocolate shake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be wonderful. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem, girlfriend. So, how soon will you be getting out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m waiting for the doctor to examine me. Is Gus terribly upset that I missed work again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he was until he found out what happened. Don\u0027t worry about your shift. Gladys and I will cover for you until you get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027d better be going so you can rest, hon. Oh, here.\" Delving into her bag, Bobbie Sue withdrew a paperback novel and dropped it on the tray. \"I thought you might like something to read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, Bobbie Sue kissed Vicki on the cheek. \"I\u0027ll call you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us know if you need anything,\" Tom said, squeezing her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to follow Bobbie Sue out the door, but Vicki called him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not still going to… to try and destroy Antonio, are you? Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a vampire, Vicki. Destroying them is what I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But last night you were working together!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Duncan ran a hand over his jaw. \"I know.\" He had worked with vampires before, he thought, thinking about Grigori and Ramsey. Maybe it was just another sign that it was time for him to look for another line of work. Lately, he was spending more time with the Undead than the living. \"Get some rest,\" he said gruffly, and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor came in later that morning. He looked at her chart and asked a few questions, then examined her wound. He pronounced it healing nicely, but concluded that she should spend another night in the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of resignation, Vicki thanked him, then closed her eyes and slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she woke, her room was filled with dozens of red roses. They filled every available space. She plucked the card from the nearest bouquet. It read, All my love, A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had ever sent her flowers before. She was still smiling when a nurse came in to remove the IV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short time later, lunch arrived, along with a box of chocolates and another dozen roses. The card read, I am dreaming of you. A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch, she settled down with the book Bobbie Sue had left for her, but she couldn\u0027t concentrate on the words. She kept seeing Falco\u0027s fiendish yellow eyes, hearing his voice in her ear as he outlined his plans for her, watching the zombies obey his commands. She wondered who they had been before Falco enslaved them. Three had been in their thirties; the fourth no more than twenty. And now they were dead because of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered with the memory, thinking how sad it was that their families would never know what had happened to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing heavy footsteps, she looked up to find Ned and Arnie striding toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afternoon, Vicki,\" Ned said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-28.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
