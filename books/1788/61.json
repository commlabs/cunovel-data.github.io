Your sisters are walking outside, except for Winnifred, who\u0027s having tea on the terrace. Have you eaten yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to the back terrace, we\u0027ll have a tray brought out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m interrupting you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Lady St. Vincent said gently. \"Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia went with her, touched and yet disconcerted by Lady St. Vincent\u0027s solicitous manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lady,\" she said, \"thank you for allowing me to wear one of your dresses. I will return it as soon as possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me Evie,\" came the warm reply. \"And you must keep the dress. It is very becoming on you, and not at all on me. That particular shade of red clashes with my hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are too kind,\" Amelia said, wishing she didn\u0027t sound so stiff, wishing she could accept the gift without feeling the weight of obligation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Evie didn\u0027t seem to notice her awkwardness, just reached for her hand and drew it through her arm as they walked, as if Amelia needed to be led like a young girl. \"Your sisters will be relieved to see you up and about. They said it was the first time they could ever remember you staying abed so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I didn\u0027t sleep well. I was ... preoccupied.\" Color climbed up the pale slopes of Amelia\u0027s cheeks as she thought of lying next to Cam\u0027s body, their clothes disheveled to reveal places of bareness and heat, lips and hands delicately investigating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure you? A quick hesitation, then Evie continued in a bemused tone. \"I\u0027m sure you had much to consider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing her gaze, Amelia realized that Evie had glanced down at the hand that rested on her sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had seen the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia\u0027s fingers curled. She looked up into the countess\u0027s curious blue eyes, and her mind went blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Evie said, catching Amelia\u0027s hand when she would have withdrawn it, pressing it back to her arm. She smiled. \"We must talk, Amelia. I thought he wasn\u0027t quite himself today. Now I understand why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to clarify who \"he\" was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lady?Evie?there is nothing between Mr. Rohan and myself. Nothing.\" Her cheeks burned with agitated color. \"I don\u0027t know what you must think of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey paused before the French doors that opened onto the back terrace, and Amelia withdrew her hand from Evie\u0027s arm. Tugging at the ring, which remained stubbornly clamped on her finger, she glanced at Evie in despair. To her astonishment, Evie did not seem at all shocked or critical, but rather understanding. There was something in her face, a sort of tender gravity, that made Amelia think, No wonder Lord St. Vincent is besotted with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re a capable young woman,\" Evie said, \"who loves her siblings and bears a great deal of responsibility for them. I think that\u0027s a heavy burden for a woman to carry alone. I also think you have a gift for accepting people as they are. And Cam knows how rare that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia felt anxious, as if she\u0027d lost something and needed to retrieve it quickly. \"I... is he still here? He should have left for London by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still here, talking with my husband and Lord Westcliff. They rode to Ramsay House early this morning to see what was left of it, and make some early assessments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia didn\u0027t like the thought of them visiting the property without consulting her or Leo. The situation was being handled as if the Hathaways were nothing more than a group of helpless children. She squared her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was very kind of them, but I can manage the situation now. I expect part of Ramsay House is still habitable, which means we won\u0027t need to prevail on Lord and Lady Westcliff\u0027s hospitality any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you must stay,\" Evie said quickly. \"Lillian has already said you are welcome to remain until Ramsay House is fully restored. This is such a large house, you would never intrude on anyone\u0027s privacy. And Lillian and Lord Westcliff will be away for at least a fortnight. They\u0027re leaving for Bristol tomorrow—along with Lord St. Vincent and myself—to visit Lillian\u0027s younger sister Daisy, who is expecting a child. So you\u0027ll have the manor to yourselves, more or less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d reduce the place to a heap of rubble by the time they returned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvie smiled. \"I suspect your family isn\u0027t as dangerous as all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know the Hathaways.\" Feeling the need to assert control over the situation, Amelia said, \"I\u0027ll ride to Ramsay House myself after I have some breakfast. If the upstairs rooms are in suitable condition, my family will be back home by nightfall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think that\u0027s best for Winnifred?\" Evie asked gently. \"Or Mr. Merripen, or Lord Ramsay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia flushed, knowing she was being unreasonable. But the feeling of impotence, being stripped of all authority, was rising in a choking mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you should speak to Cam,\" Evie said, \"before any decisions are made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has nothing to do with my decisions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvie gave her a thoughtful look. \"Forgive me. I shouldn\u0027t make assumptions. It\u0027s just that the ring on your finger?Cam\u0027s worn it since he was twelve years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia tugged violently at the ring. \"I don\u0027t know why he gave it to me. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s of no significance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it has very great significance,\" Evie said softly. \"Cam has been an outsider for his entire life. Even when he lived with the Rom. I think he\u0027s always secretly hoped he could someday find a place where he would belong. But until he met you, it didn\u0027t occur to him that it might not be a place he was looking for, but a person.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-61.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
