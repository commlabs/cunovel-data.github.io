Cadderly had already cast prepared defensive spells upon himself, Danica, Ivan, and Pikel, but it occurred to Entreri that the priest might use this opportunity to get rid of him. What better way to destroy Entreri than to have him face the breath of a dragon errantly thinking he had proper magical defenses against such a firestorm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin glanced over at Jarlaxle, who had refused Cadderly\u0027s aid, claiming he had his own methods. The dark elf nodded to him and waggled his fingers, silently assuring Entreri that Cadderly had indeed placed the antifire enchantment upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was done, Cadderly stepped back and inspected the group. \"I still believe that I can do this better alone,\" he remarked, drawing a scowl from both Danica and Entreri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was as simple as erecting a fire barrier and tossing out the artifact for the dragon to breathe upon, I would agree,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"You may need to goad the beast to breathe, I fear. Wyrms are not quick to use their most powerful weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it sees us all, it will more likely loose its breath,\" Danica reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poof!\" agreed Pikel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contingencies, my dear Cadderly,\" said Jarlaxle. \"We must allow for every contingency, must prepare for every eventuality and turn in the game. With an ancient and intelligent wyrm, no variable is unlikely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversation ended as they both noted Pikel hopping about his brother, sprinkling some powder over the protesting and slapping Ivan, while singing a whimsical song. He finished with a wide smile, and hopped up and whispered into Ivan\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Says he got a spell of his own to add,\" the yellow- bearded dwarf remarked. \"Put one on meself and on himself, and\u0027s wondering which o\u0027 ye othersll be wantin\u0027 one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What type of spell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another fire protection,\" Ivan explained. \"Says doodads can do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought a laugh to Jarlaxle-not because he didn\u0027t believe the dwarf\u0027s every word, but because he found the entire spectacle of a dwarven druid quite charming. He bowed to Pikel and accepted the dwarf\u0027s next spellcasting. The others followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will be as quick as possible,\" Cadderly explained, moving them all to the large window at the back of the room on a high floor in one of the Spirit Soaring\u0027s towering spires. \"Our goal is to destroy the item and nothing more. We are not to battle the beast, not to raise its ire, and,\" he looked at Entreri and Jarlaxle as he finished, \"surely not to attempt to steal anything from mighty Hephaestus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" the priest added, \"the enchantments upon you may diminish one blast of Hephaestus\u0027s fire, perhaps two, but not much more than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One will be enough,\" Entreri replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much,\" muttered Jarlaxle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does everyone know his or her role and position when we enter the dragon\u0027s main chamber?\" Danica,asked, ignoring the grumbling drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo questions came back at her. Taking that as an affirmative answer, Cadderly began casting yet again, a wind-walking spell that soon carried them out of the cathedral and across the miles to the south and east to the caverns of mighty Hephaestus. The priest didn\u0027t magically walk them in the front door, but rather soared along deeper chambers, the understructure of the cavern complex, coming into a large antechamber to the dragon\u0027s main lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he broke the spell, depositing their material forms in the cavern, they could hear the great sighing sound of the sleeping wyrm, the huge intake and smoky exhalation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle put a finger to pursed lips and inched ahead, as silent as could be. He disappeared around an outcropping of stone, and came right back in, actually clutching the wall to steady himself. He looked at the others and nodded grimly, though there could be no doubt he had seen the beast simply from the expression on his normally confident face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly and Entreri led the way, Danica and Jarlaxle followed, with the Bouldershoulder brothers behind. The tunnel behind the outcropping wound only for a short distance, and opened up widely into a huge cavern, its floor crisscrossed by many cracks and crevices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe companions hardly noticed the physical features of that room, though, for there before them, looming like a mountain of doom, lay Hephaestus, its red-gold scales gleaming from its own inner heat. The beast was huge, even curled as it was, its size alone mocking them and making every one of them want to fall to his knees and pay homage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one of the traps in dealing with dragons, that awe-inspiring aura of sheer power, that emanation of helplessness to all who would look upon their horrible splendor. These were not novice warriors, though, trying to make a quick stab at great fame. These were seasoned veterans, every one. Each, with the exception of Artemis Entreri, had faced a beast such as Hephaestus before. Despite his inexperience in this particular arena, nothing in all the world-not a dragon, not an arch-devil, not a demon lord-could take the heart from Artemis Entreri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wyrm\u0027s eye, seeming more like that of a cat than a lizard, with a green iris and a slitted pupil that quickly widened to adjust to the dim light, popped open as soon as the group entered. Hephaestus watched their every movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think to catch me sleeping?\" the dragon said quietly, which still made its voice sound like an avalanche to the companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly called out a cueing word to his companions, and snapped his fingers, bringing forth a magical light that filled all the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp snapped Hephaestus\u0027s great horned head, the pupils of its eyes fast thinning. It turned as it rose, to face the impertinent priest directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the side, Entreri eased the Crystal Shard out of his pouch, ready to throw it before the beast as soon as Hephaestus seemed about to loose its fiery breath. Jarlaxle, too, was ready, for his job in this was to use his innate dark elf powers to bring forth a globe of darkness over the artifact as the flames consumed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thieves!\" the dragon roared. Its voice shook the chamber and sent shudders through the floor-a poignant reminder to Cadderly of the instability of this place. \"You have come to steal the treasure of Hephaestus. You have prepared your proper spells and wear items of magic that you consider powerful, but are you truly prepared? Can any mere mortal truly be prepared to face the awful splendor that is Hephaestus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly tuned out the words and fell into the song of Deneir, seeking some powerful spell, some type of mighty magical chaos, perhaps, as he had once used against Fyrentennimar, that he could trick the beast and be done with this. His best spells against the previous dragon had been of reverse aging, lessening the beast with mighty spellcasting, but he could not use those this time, for so doing would diminish the dragon\u0027s breath as well, and defeat their very purpose in being there. He had other magic at his disposal, though, and the Song of Deneir rang triumphantly in his head. Along with that song, though, the priest heard the calls of Crenshinibon, discordant notes in the melody and surely a distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something is amiss,\" Jarlaxle whispered to Entreri. \"The beast expected us and anticipates our movements. It should have risen with attacks, not words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri glanced at him, and back at Hephaestus, the great head swaying back and forth, back and forth. He glanced down at the Crystal Shard, wondering if it had betrayed them to the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Crenshinibon was sending forth its plea at that time, to the beast and against Cadderly\u0027s spellcasting, but it had not been the Crystal Shard that had warned Hephaestus of intruders. No, that distinction fell to a certain dark elf wizard-cleric, hiding in a tunnel across the way along with a handful of drow companions. Right before Cadderly and the others had wind-walked into the lair, Rai-guy had sent a magical whisper to Hephaestus, a warning of intruders and a suggestion that these thieves had come with magic designed to use the creature\u0027s own breath against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Rai-guy waited for the appearance of the Crystal Shard, for the moment when he and his companions, including Kammuriel, could strike hard and begone, their prize in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thieves we are, and we\u0027ll have your treasure!\" shouted Jarlaxle. He used a language that none of the others, save Hephaestus, understood, a tongue of the red dragons, and one that the great wyrms believed that few others could begin to master. Jarlaxle, using a whistle that he kept on a chain around his neck, spoke it with perfect inflection. Hephaestus\u0027s head snapped down in line with him, the wyrm\u0027s eyes going wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri dived aside in a roll, coming right back to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\" the assassin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle\u0027s fingers worked furiously. He thinks that I am another red dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere seemed a long, long moment of absolute quiet, of a gigantic hush before a more gigantic storm. Then everything exploded into motion, beginning with Cadderly\u0027s leap forward, his arm extended, finger pointing accusingly at the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hephaestus!\" the priest roared at the appropriate moment of spellcasting. \"Burn me if you can!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more than a dare, more than a challenge, and more than a threat. It was a magical compulsion, launched through a powerful spell. Though forewarned by some vague suggestions against the action, Hephaestus sucked in its tremendous breath, the force of the intake drawing Cadderly\u0027s curly brown locks forward onto his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri dived ahead and pulled forth Crenshinibon, tossing it to the floor before the priest. Jarlaxle, even as Hephaestus tilted back its head, came forward with the great exhalation and produced his globe of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Crenshinibon screamed in Entreri\u0027s head, so powerful and angry a call that the assassin grabbed at his ears and stumbled aside, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe artifact\u0027s call was abruptly cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHephaestus\u0027s head came forward, a great line of fire roaring down, mocking Jarlaxle\u0027s globe, mocking Cadderly and all his spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the globe of darkness came up over the Crystal Shard, Rai-guy grabbed at it with a spell of telekinesis, a sudden and powerful burst of snatching power that sent the item flying fast across the way, past Hephaestus, who was seemingly oblivious to it, and down the corridor to the hiding wizard-cleric\u0027s waiting hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRai-guy\u0027s red-glowing eyes narrowed as he turned to regard Kimmuriel, for it had been Kimmuriel\u0027s task to so snatch the item-a task the psionicist had apparently neglected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not fast enough, the psionicist\u0027s fingers waggled at his companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rai-guy knew better, and so did Crenshinibon, for the powers of the mind were among the quickest of magic to enact. Still staring hard at his companion, Rai-guy began spellcasting once more, aiming for the great chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn and on went the fiery maelstrom, and in the middle of it stood Cadderly, his arms out wide, praying to Deneir to see him through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica, Ivan, and Pikel stared at him intently, praying as well, but Jarlaxle was more concerned with his darkness, and Entreri was looking more to Jarlaxle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear not the continuing call of Crenshinibon!\" Entreri cried hopefully above the fiery roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle was shaking his head. \"The darkness should have been consumed by the artifact\u0027s destruction,\" he cried back, sensing that something was terribly, terribly wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fires ended, leaving a seething Hephaestus still staring at the unharmed priest of Deneir. The dragon\u0027s eyes narrowed to threatening slits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle dispelled his darkness globe, and there remained no sign of Crenshinibon among the bubbling, molten stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We done it!\" Ivan cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home!\" Pikel pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" insisted Jarlaxle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could explain, a low humming sound filled the chamber, a noise the dark elf had heard before and one that didn\u0027t strike him as overly pleasant at that dangerous moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A magical dispel!\" the dark elf warned. \"Our enchantments are threatened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis left them, they all realized, in a room with an outraged, ancient, huge red dragon without many of their protections in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What d\u0027 we do?\" Ivan growled, slapping the handle of his battle axe across his open palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wee!\" Pikel answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wee?\" the perplexed yellow-bearded dwarf echoed, his face screwed up as he stared at his green-haired brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wee!\" Pikel said again, and to accentuate his point, he grabbed Ivan by the collar and ran him a short distance to the side, to the edge of a crevice, and leaped off, taking Ivan on the dive with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHephaestus\u0027s great wings beat the air, lifting the huge wyrm\u0027s front half high above the floor. Its hind legs clawed at the floor, digging deep gullies in the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run away!\" Cadderly cried, agreeing wholeheartedly with Pikel\u0027s choice. \"All of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica rushed forward, as did Jarlaxle, the woman rolling into a ready crouch before the wyrm. Hephaestus wasted not a second in snapping its great maw down at her. She scrambled aside, coming up from her roll in a crouch again, taunting the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly couldn\u0027t watch it, reminding himself that he simply had to trust in her. She was buying him precious moments, he knew, that he might launch another magical attack or defensive spell, perhaps, at Hephaestus. He fell into the song of Deneir again and heard its notes more clearly this time, as he sorted through an array of spells to launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a scream, Danica\u0027s scream, and he looked up to see Hephaestus\u0027s fiery breath drive down upon her, striking the stone floor and spraying up in an inverted fan of fires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly, too, cried out, and reached desperately into the song of Deneir for the first spell he could find that would alter that horrible scene, the first enchantment he could think of to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought forth an earthquake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as it started-a violent shudder and rumbling, like waves on a pond, lifting and rolling the floor-Jarlaxle drew the dragon\u0027s attention his way by hitting the beast with a stream of stinging daggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri, too, moved-and surprised himself by going ahead instead of back, toward the spot where Hephaestus had just breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, too, there was only bubbling stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly called out for Danica, desperately, but his voice fell away as the floor collapsed beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us begone, and quickly,\" Kimmuriel remarked, \"before the great wyrm recognizes that there were more than those six intruders in its lair this day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and the other drow had already moved some distance down the tunnel, away from the main chamber. Leaving altogether seemed a prudent suggestion, one that had Berg\u0027inyon Baenre and the other five drow soldiers nodding eagerly, but one that, for some reason, did not seem acceptable to the stern Rai-guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said firmly. \"They must all die, here and now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As the dragon will likely kill them,\" Berg\u0027inyon agreed, but Rai-guy was shaking his head, indicating that such a probability simply wasn\u0027t good enough for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRai-guy and Crenshinibon were already fully into their bonding by then. The Crystal Shard demanded that Cadderly and the others, these infidels who understood the secret to its destruction, be killed immediately. It demanded that nothing concerning the group be left to chance. Besides, it telepathically coaxed Rai-guy, would not a red dragon be an enormous asset to add to Bregan D\u0027aerthe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find them and kill them, every one!\" Rai-guy demanded emphatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerg\u0027inyon considered the command, and broke his soldiers into two groups and ran off with one group, the other heading a different direction. Kimmuriel spent a longer time staring hard at Rai-guy, seeming less than pleased. He, too, disappeared eventually, seemed simply to fall through the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving Rai-guy alone with his newest and most beloved ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an alcove off to the side of the tunnel where Rai-guy stood, Yharaskrik\u0027s less-than-corporeal form slid through the stone and materialized, the illithid\u0027s Crenshinibon- defeating lantern in its hand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-24.html","bookId":2138,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:35 PM"}
