I\u0027m kinda psychic, you know. Not the full- blown type, but I think spending time with all of you vampires has sort of rubbed off on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had met Allison on my last case, the girlfriend of another boxer. A murdered boxer. Allison and I had shared a...moment. A highly unusually moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo moments, in fact, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and I had connected, or bonded instantly. She had quickly seen through my fa\u0026amp;ccedil;ade, having dated a vampire herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the next thing I knew, she was allowing me to drink from a wound in her hand. A wound that had quickly healed once I was done drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy life is so weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d talked often since, although we had yet to meet again. She had quickly become like an old girlfriend to me. A sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blood sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m going on a trip,\" I said, now reaching for some jeans in my closet, cradling the phone against my shoulder and ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? I knew you were going on a trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m coming with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am, Sam. You need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need you how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a business trip, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sense very strongly that you are going to need my help, if you know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I did know what she meant. I stopped reaching for my jeans as I stood there in front of my open closet. A closet, I might add, that was quickly filling up with clothes. Now that I could actually go into the light of day, I needed a whole new wardrobe, right? Like that tank top I had just dropped in the suitcase. Many cute tank tops, in fact. And shorts. And sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was, of course, referring to fresh human blood - fresh, as in, straight from the source. A living, human source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch blood energized me unlike anything I\u0027d ever had before. Yes, I\u0027d had human blood - but never hemoglobin straight from a willing source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Allison had been very, very willing. Apparently, she loved the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I don\u0027t think my client will allow you to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say I\u0027m your assistant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt she\u0027ll - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She will, Sam. Trust me. And trust me when I say you will need me. I\u0027m here now at the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my mouth dropped. Correction, I know my mouth dropped open. \"What airport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"LAX. The 4:40 flight. Lucky for me they had one seat left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess...\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Row 17, Seat C.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at my ticket next to my suitcase. Row 17, Seat B.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re freaking me out,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get that a lot,\" she said. \"Now, chop-chop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, she hung up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-4.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
