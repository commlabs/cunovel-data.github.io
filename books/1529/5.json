{"id":104759,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eBalthazar reached behind Vigor and shifted the door closed, shutting out the light from the other room. He then clicked on a small hand lamp. It bathed the room in purple, lighting up his white coveralls. \"We use ultraviolet light during art restoration projects. It can help bring forth details the naked eye can miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalthazar pointed to the marble floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Vigor had already noted what had appeared under the lamp\u0027s glow. A shape, painted crudely, shone on the center of the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curled dragon, nearly turned upon its own tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor\u0027s breath choked in his throat. He even stumbled back a step, trapped between horror and disblief. His ears roared with the memory of blood and screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalthazar placed a hand on his shoulder, steadying him. \"Are you all right? Maybe I should have better prepared you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stepped out of the man\u0027s grip. \"I. . . I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo prove this, he knelt closer to inspect the glowing mark, a mark he knew too well. The sigil of Ordinis Draconis. The Imperial Royal Dragon Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalthazar met his eye, the whites glowing under the ultraviolet. It was the Dragon Court that had burned this tower two years ago, aided by the traitorous former prefect of the Secret Archives, Prefetto Alberto, now dead. It was a story Vigor had thought long ended, finally put to rest, especially now with the tower\u0027s phoenixlike rise from the smoke and ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the mark doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor knelt with a crick of his left knee. The mark looked hastily sketched. Just a crude approximation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalthazar hovered at his shoulder. \"I studied it with a magnifying loupe. I found a drop of restoration paste beneath the fluorescent paint, indicating it had been recently drawn. Within the week, I\u0027d guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thief.. .\" Vigor mumbled, remembering the start of the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not just a common thief after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor massaged his knee. The mark could only be of dire import. A threat or warning, maybe a message to another Dragon Court mole in the Vatican. He remembered Balthazar\u0027s message: A most horrible and wonderful discovery has been made. Staring at the dragon, Vigor now understood the horrible nature of that message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor glanced over his shoulder. \"You also mentioned discovering something wonderful in your note.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalthazar nodded. He reached behind and opened the closet\u0027s door, allowing in a flood of light from the outer room. With the brightness, the phosphorescent dragon vanished off the floor, as if shunning the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Vigor allowed a long breath to escape with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come see this.\" Balthazar knelt beside Vigor. \"We would have missed this if not for the dragon painting on the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward on a palm and reached out with his other hand. His fingers brushed across the bare stone. \"It took the loupe to reveal this. I caught sight of it when examining the fluorescent paint. While I waited for you, I cleared some of the centuries of grime and dirt from the carving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor studied the stone floor. \"What carving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lean closer. Feel here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcentrating, Vigor obeyed. He felt more than saw, with his fingertips, like a blind man reading Braille. There was a faint inscription in the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor didn\u0027t even need Balthazar\u0027s assessment to know the carving was ancient. The symbols were as crisp as scientific notation, but this was no physicist\u0027s scrawl. As the former head of the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archaeology, Vigor recognized the significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalthazar must have read his reaction. His voice lowered to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Is it truly what I think it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor sat back and rubbed the dust from his fingertips. \"A script older than Hebrew,\" he mumbled. \"The first language if you were to believe the stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why was it drawn here? What does it signify?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor shook his head and studied the floor, another question growing. Again the dragon sigil appeared, but only in his mind\u0027s eye, lit by his worry rather than the glow of ultraviolet. Upon the stone, the dragon had coiled around the inscription, as if protecting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend\u0027s earlier words returned to Vigor. We would have missed this if not for the painting on the floor. Maybe the dragon was not so much protecting the ancient carving as meant to illuminate it, to cast a spotlight upon it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut whose eyes was it meant for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Vigor pictured the twisted dragon, he again felt the weight of Jakob\u0027s body in his arms, smoking and charred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment Vigor knew the truth. The message was not meant for another Dragon Court operative, another traitor like Prefect Alberto. It was meant to draw someone intimately tied to the history of the Dragon Court, someone who would know its significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message had been left for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? What was its meaning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor slowly stood. He knew someone who might be able to help, someone he had avoided calling lor the past year. Until now, there had been no need to keep in touch, especially after the man had broken up with Vigor\u0027s niece. But Vigor knew a part of his reticence rested not just with broken hearts. The man, as much as this tower, reminded Vigor of the bloody past here, a past he wanted to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon sigil glowed before his mind\u0027s eye, full of dread warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 4, 11:44 p.m. Takoma Park, Maryland\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gray, can you empty the kitchen trash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be right there, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the living room, Commander Gray Pierce picked up another empty bottle of Sam Adams, another dead soldier of his parents\u0027 July Fourth celebration, and chucked it into the plastic bin under his arm. At least the party was winding down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked his watch. Almost midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray gathered another two beer bottles off the front entry table and paused before the open doorway, appreciating a bit of breeze through the screen door. The night smelled of jasmine, along with a lingering hint of smoke from fireworks exploded by the block party. Off in the distance, a few whistles and crackles continued to punctuate the night. A dog howled from the yard behind his mother, aggravated by the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a few guests remained on the front porch of his parents\u0027 Craftsman bungalow, lazing about on the porch swing or leaning on the railing, enjoying the cool night after the usual swelter of a Maryland summer. They had watched the fireworks from the perch there hours earlier. Afterward, the partygoers had slowly dwindled away into the night. Only the most diehard remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Gray\u0027s boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirector Crowe leaned against a post, bent next to the teaching assistant who worked for Gray\u0027s mother. He was a dour young man from the Congo who attended George Washington University on a scholarship. Painter Crowe had been inquiring about the state of hostilities in the man\u0027s homeland. It seemed even at a party, the director of Sigma Force kept a finger on the world\u0027s pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also why he made such a great director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigma Force functioned as the covert field arm for DARPA, the Department of Defense\u0027s research and development division. Members were sent out to safeguard or neutralize technologies vital to U.S. security. The team consisted of ex—Special Forces soldiers who had been handpicked in secret and placed into rigorous doctoral programs, forming a militarized team of technically trained operatives. Or as Monk, Gray\u0027s friend and team member, liked to joke: killer scientists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith such responsibility, Director Crowe\u0027s only relaxation this night seemed to be the single-malt scotch resting on the porch rail. He\u0027d been nursing it all evening. As if sensing the scrutiny, Painter nodded to Gray through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the wan illumination of a few candlelit lanterns, the director cast a stony figure, dressed in dark slacks and a pressed linen shirt. His half-Native American heritage could be read in the hard planes of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray studied those planes, searching for any cracks in his demeanor, knowing the pressure he must be under. Sigma\u0027s organizational structure had been undergoing a comprehensive NSA and DARPA internal audit, and now a medical crisis was brewing in Southeast Asia. So it was good to see the man out of Sigma\u0027s subterranean offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only for this one night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, duty was never far from the director\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProving this, Painter stretched, pushed off the rail, and stepped to the door. \"I should head off,\" he called to Gray, and checked his wristwatch. \"Thought I\u0027d stop by the office and check to see if Lisa and Monk have arrived safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair of scientists, Drs. Lisa Cummings and Monk Kokkalis, had been sent to investigate a medical crisis among the Indonesian islands. The pair, traveling as adjuncts to the World Health Organization, had left this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pushed through the swinging screen door and shook his boss\u0027s hand. He knew Painter\u0027s interest in the pair\u0027s itinerary stretched beyond his role as field ops director. He read the worry of a man in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure Lisa is fine,\" Gray assured him, knowing Lisa and Painter had barely been apart of late. \"That is, as long as she packed her earplugs. Monk\u0027s snoring could rattle the engine off a jet\u0027s wing. And speaking of the one-man bugle corps, if you hear any news, you\u0027ll let Kat know—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter raised a hand. \"She\u0027s already buzzed my BlackBerry twice this evening, checking if I\u0027d heard any word.\" He downed his scotch. \"I\u0027ll call her immediately once I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspect Monk will beat you to that call, what with two women to answer to now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter smiled, if a bit tiredly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree months ago Kat and Monk had brought home a new baby girl, six pounds and three ounces, christened Penelope Anne. After being assigned this current field op, Monk had joked about escaping diapers and midnight feedings, but Gray recognized how it tore a little hole in his friend\u0027s heart to leave behind his wife and baby girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for coming over, Director. I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please pass on my thanks to your folks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReminded, Gray glanced to the flood of light along the left side of the house, coming from the detached garage around back. His father had retreated there some time ago. Not all the fireworks this evening had been out on the streets. Lately, his father was finding social situations more and more difficult as his Alzheimer\u0027s progressed, forgetting names, repeating questions already answered. His frustration led to a private flare-up between father and son. Afterward, his father had stomped off to the garage and his shop. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-5.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
