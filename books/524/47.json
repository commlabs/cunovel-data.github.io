{"id":21298,"no":47,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"With many tears, and the help of the kindly farmer\u0027s daughter at Eggs Hole, who acted as penwoman, Bessie wrote a letter to Robert in the Battery gaol:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You must not think, my dearest lad, that anything what you have done can separate you and me. We belong to each other as it seems, and what you have done I forgive as you would if I had done it. I shall always be yours, Robby, no matter how long you are in prison, I shall be waiting, and thinking of you always. And I forgive you for not telling me you had taken the money, but that a friend had lent it to you, because you thought I would not have gone away with you, but I would have, surely. Be brave and do not fret. I wish it was all over, but we must not fret.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"From your loving \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Bessie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The proceedings before the Rye magistrates had been brief, and ended in Robert\u0027s committal for trial at Quarter Sessions. He had made no attempt to deny his guilt—it would have been useless. He was almost dumb in the dock, for his soul was struck with wonder at the cruel circumstances which had betrayed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had been tracked by the number on the note—it was the first time he realised that notes had numbers. This particular note had been given by Sir Miles Bardon to his son as a part of his quarterly allowance, and though Ralph was far too unpractical to notice the number himself, his father had a habit of marking such things, and had written it down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The saddler at Rye had not heard of the theft when young Backfield handed over the note in payment of the harness bill. He had at the time remarked to his wife[Pg 170] that old Ben seemed pretty flush with his money, but had thought no more of it till the matter was cried by the Town Crier that evening, after Robert and Pete had gone home. Then out of mere curiosity he had looked at the number on his note, and found it was the same as the Crier had announced. Early the next day he went to the Police Station, and as young Bardon now remembered lending his coat to Robert Backfield it was fairly easy to guess how the theft had been committed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Squire regretted the matter profoundly, but it was too late now not to proceed with it, so he made it a hundred times worse by writing an apologetic letter to Reuben, and asking the magistrate to deal gently with the offender. Robert\u0027s pathetic story, and the tearful evidence of his sweetheart, gave him at once all the public sympathy; the blame was divided pretty equally between the Bardons and Backfield.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richard bitterly abused his father to Anne, as they met in the midst of the strife of their two families:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s always the same, he keeps us under, and makes our lives a misery till we do something mad. He\u0027s only got himself to thank for this. We\u0027re all the slaves of his tedious farm——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should rather say \u0027abominable,\u0027\" Anne interrupted gently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"His abominable farm—he gets every bit of work out of us he can, till we\u0027re justabout desperate——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Till we\u0027re absolutely desperate.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And he expects us to care for nothing but his vulgar ambitions. Oh Lord! I wish I was out of it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps you will be out of it some day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shrugged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How should I get free?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps a friend might help you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked into her face, then suddenly crimsoned—then paled, to flush again:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, ma\u0027am, ma\u0027am—if ever you cud help me get[Pg 171] free—if ever ... oh, I—I\u0027d sarve you all my life—I\u0027d——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hush,\" she said gently—\"that\u0027s still in the future—and remember not to say \u0027sarve.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Quarter Sessions were held early in December, and Robert\u0027s case came wedged between the too hopeful finances of a journeyman butcher and the woes of a farmer from Guldeford who had tried to drown himself and his little boy off the Midrips. Robert was sentenced to three years\u0027 imprisonment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing remarkable about the trial, and nothing to be said against the sentence from the point of either justice or humanity. Ten years ago the boy would have been transported to Van Diemen\u0027s Land. The Bardons took it upon themselves to be outrageously sorry, and were rather mystified by Reuben\u0027s contemptuous attitude towards them and their regrets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The evidence had been merely a repetition of that which had been given before the magistrate, though Bessie did not cry this time in the witness-box, and Robert in the dock was not dumb—on the contrary, he tried to explain to the Recorder what it felt like to have absolutely no money of one\u0027s own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben was present at the trial, and sitting erect, in his good town clothes, drew the public glance away both from the prisoner and the Recorder. Feeling was against him, and when in his summing-up Mr. Reeve remarked on the strangeness of a young man of Backfield\u0027s age having no money and being compelled to work without wages, a low murmur went round the court, which Reuben did not seem to hear. He sat very stiffly while the sentence was pronounced, and afterwards refused to see his son before he was taken away to Lewes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor feller, this \u0027ull be the breaking of him,\" said Vennal outside the Court-house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No more\u0027n he deserves. He\u0027s a hard man,\" said Ditch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thinks only of his farm and nothing of his flesh and blood,\" said old Realf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It sarves un right,\" said Ginner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So it was throughout the crowd. Some said \"poor man,\" others muttered \"his own fault.\" But all words, either of pity or blame, were silenced when Backfield came out of the Court-house and walked through the people, his head high, his step firm, his back straight.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59419.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
