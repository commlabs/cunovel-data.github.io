One may, like Cobbett, look on literature with political eyes, without, like him, making it a vehicle of party attacks. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In this country, where the political genius of the people lies in self-government—where the public growth of the people and their internal liberty depend upon their capacity to manage their own affairs—the art of public speaking has political importance to every aide in politics.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To be able to take a subject well in hand, like a stage-coach driver does his horses—to hold the reins of your arguments firmly—to direct and drive well home the burden of your meaning, is a power which every man ought to study to attain, who rises to address a council, or stands up on a platform to convince a meeting.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3199/87418.html","bookId":764,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:46:35 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:46:35 AM"}
