He thought them all as good as dead. \"Dennel and Guybon are arguing over placement of the dragons for a last stand. Aludra is measuring the charges\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes, finally standing, sagged against Melten. Before him, two thousand people clustered in the large city square. They huddled like men in the wilderness seeking one another’s warmth on a cold night. Dennel and Guybon had set up the dragons in a half-circle bowed outward, pointing toward the center of the city, refugees behind. The Band was now committed to manning the dragons; three pairs of hands were needed to operate each weapon. Almost all of the Band had had at least some training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buildings nearby had caught fire, but the light was doing strange things. Why didn’t it reach the streets? Those were all too dark. As if they’d been painted. Like . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, clearing the tears of pain from his eyes, realization dawning. Trollocs filled the streets like ink flowing toward the half-circle of dragons that were pointed at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething held the Trollocs back for the moment. They’re waiting until they are all together for a rush, Talmanes thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalls and snarls came from behind. Talmanes pivoted, then clutched Melten’s arm as the world lurched. He waited for it to steady. The pain . . . the pain was actually dulling. Like glowing flames running out of fresh coal. It had feasted upon him, but there wasn’t much left of him for it to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs things steadied, Talmanes saw what was creating the snarls. The square they were in adjoined the city wall, but the townspeople and soldiers had kept their distance from the wall, for it was coated with Trollocs, like a thick grime. They raised weapons in the air and roared down at the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They throw down spears at anyone who comes too close, Melten said. \"We’d been hoping to reach the wall, then follow it along to the gate, but we can’t—not with those things up there raining death upon us. All other routes are cut off\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAludra approached Guybon and Dennel. \"Charges, I can set under the dragons\", she said to them; softly, but not as softly as she should have. \"These charges, they will destroy the weapons. They may hurt the people in an unpleasant way\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it\", Guybon said very softly. \"What the Trollocs would do is worse, and we cannot allow the dragons to fall into the Shadow’s hands. That’s why they’re waiting. Their leaders are hoping that a sudden rush will give them time to overwhelm us and seize the weapons\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They’re moving!\" a soldier called from beside the dragons. \"Light, they’re coming!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat dark slime of Shadowspawn bubbled down the streets. Teeth, nails, claws, too-human eyes. The Trollocs came from all sides, eager for the kill. Talmanes struggled to draw breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the walls, the calls grew excited. We’re surrounded, Talmanes thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressed back against the wall, caught in a net. We . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressed back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dennel!\" Talmanes shouted over the din. The captain of dragons turned from his line, where men waited with burning punks for the call to launch the one volley they’d have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes took a deep breath that made his lungs burn. \"You told me that you could level an enemy bulwark in only a few shots\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course\", Dennel called. \"But we\u0027re not trying to enter . . \" He trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, Talmanes thought. We’re all so exhausted. We should have seen this. \"You in the middle, Ryden’s dragon squad, about-face!\" Talmanes screamed. \"The rest of you, stay in position and fire at the oncoming Trollocs! Move, move, mover\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragoners sprang into motion, Ryden and his men hastily turning their weapons about, wheels creaking. The other dragons began to fire a pattern of shot that sprayed through the streets entering the square. The booms were deafening, causing refugees to scream and cover their ears. It sounded like the end of the world. Hundreds, thousands of Trollocs went down in pools of blood as dragons’ eggs exploded in their midst. The square filled with white smoke that poured from the mouths of the dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refugees behind, already terrified by what they had just witnessed, shrieked as Ryden’s dragons turned on them, and most of them fell to the ground in fright, clearing a path. A path that exposed the Trolloc-infested city wall. Ryden’s line of dragons bowed inward like a cup, the reverse formation of those firing into the Trollocs behind, so that the tubes were pointed at the same section of city wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me one of those bloody punks!\" Talmanes shouted, holding out a hand. One of the dragoners obeyed, passing him a flaming brand with a glowing red tip. He pushed away from Melten, determined to stand on his own for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuybon stepped up. The man’s voice sounded soft to Talmanes’ strained ears. \"Those walls have stood for hundreds of years. My poor city. My poor, poor city\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s not your city any longer\", Talmanes said, raising his flaming brand high in the air, defiant before a wall thick with Trollocs, a burning city to his back. \"It’s theirs\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes swiped the brand down in the air, leaving a trail of red. His signal ignited a roar of dragonfire that echoed throughout the square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrollocs—pieces of them, at least—blew into the air. The wall under them exploded like a stack of children’s blocks kicked at a full run. As Talmanes wavered, his vision blackening, he saw the wall crumble outward. When he toppled, slipping into unconsciousness, the ground seemed to tremble from the force of his fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEastward the Wind Blew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEastward the wind blew, descending from lofty mountains and coursing over desolate hills. It passed into the place known as the Westwood, an area that had once flourished with pine and leatherleaf. Here, the wind found little more than tangled underbrush, thick save around an occasional towering oak. Those looked stricken by disease, bark peeling free, branches drooping. Elsewhere needles had fallen from pines, draping the ground in a brown blanket.
