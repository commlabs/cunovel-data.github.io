Students had revelations of being Web designers, pharmacists, and restaurateurs. I prayed we wouldn\u0027t get to Trevor and me, but the clock had ten minutes remaining. My prayers weren\u0027t answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did you learn about yourselves?\" Mrs.Naper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor, always the star, had no inhibitions about being the center of attention. He sprang up next to Mrs.Naper\u0027s desk while I walked past my classmates as if I were headed for the guillotine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was in kindergarten,\" Trevor began, \"like most boys, I wanted to be a superhero.\" A few girls in the front row giggled. Trevor stopped and shot them a cold stare until the girls glanced away. \"Of course, I\u0027m not that kidanymore,\" he continued, \"but I do like action, speed, and competition. What I\u0027ve learned from this assignment and the interview is that when you are a kid, you don\u0027t worry about what others think of your ideas. And your dreams have no boundaries. It might be easy, predictable, and even safe to follow in my parents\u0027 professions. But my essay is about how a superhero has courage, and it takes courage to follow your dream. And my goal...,\" he began, and then turned to me, \"is to be a professional soccer player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us something we don\u0027t know,\" aPradabee said, flipping through her notebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was really surprised at Trevor\u0027s speech. I had challenged my nemesis with my earlier assessment of him and he felt he had to prove to me that he wasn\u0027t the coward I thought he was. I wondered if I hadn\u0027t said anything, if Trevor would have stood here proclaiming he wanted to be a real estate developer like his dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe class applauded and Mrs.Naper grinned at her student pet. \"Very interesting and well spoken, Trevor,\" she complimented. \"Now we have just enough time for Raven\u0027s presentation before the bell rings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed out at my fellow students. They glared back like I was the lead act at a freak show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was young,\" I began, \"I wanted to be a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy classmates snickered. I pursed my lips and clutched my fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle down,\" Mrs.Naper commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked to Becky, who gave me the thumbs-up sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And since then,\" I continued, \"I\u0027ve lived my life in a way and style that reflects that. It never mattered to me what other people wore-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously,\" I heard someone say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orsaid\" I continued. \"And because of this I\u0027ve always been an outcast. Just by being me. So I imagine that I\u0027ll find a profession that suits me-perhaps being an editor of my owngoth fashionmag ,\" I said enthusiastically. \"But as we are looking toward our future, I\u0027m not sure it matters what we want to be but ratherwho we want to be. Someone honestor deceitful?Someone kind or cruel?Someone loyal or unfaithful? In any profession we can elect to be any of those things. I think this assignment is not only about what we choose todo but about who we choose tobe. I choose to always be loyal to myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in front of my classmates, waiting for their response. No laughter. No snickering. No booing. I turned to Mrs.Naper and Trevor, who both appeared stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the bell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved the assignment was finallyover, I followed Trevor and handed in my essay. As the students filed out of class, I overheard a cheerleader speaking with her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I said I want to be a model, but what I meant was anice model,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said one of thePradabees . \"When I have my designer clothing line, I\u0027ll give ten percent of the goods to charity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the two girls left, a member of the band was suddenly standing next to me. \"I said I wanted to be a teacher, butI really haven\u0027t decided what I want to do,\" he shared with me. \"You made me feel that it was okay to focus on myself for a while. And the rest will follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it will,\" I said reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs.Naper put Trevor\u0027s and my essays in her folder. \"In all the years I\u0027ve been giving this assignment, yours and Trevor\u0027s presentations were two of the best.\" She gloated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor put his arm around me before I could bat it away. \"Guess that means we\u0027ll be working together again very soon,\" he said triumphantly, and disappeared into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky handed me my backpack.\"Seems like your presentation was more powerful than you planned. Maybe you should be a motivational speaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I wear combat boots?\" asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be the only one,\" she said, and dragged me out of class. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-28.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
