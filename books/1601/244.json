This was the second time they had allowed an assassin to reach her, and while she did not blame them for the failure, to deny them punishment would be to deny them their honor. It twisted her heart about, but she knew what she would have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave the order herself. Selucia, as her Voice, should have done it—but Selucia’s wounds were being tended. And Karede deserved this small honor of receiving his execution order from Fortuona herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will go to engage the enemy marath\u0027damane directly\", she ordered Karede. \"Each of you who was on duty. Fight valiantly for the Empire there, and try to slay the enemy’s marath\u0027damane\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see Karede relax. It was a way to continue serving; he would probably have fallen on his own sword, if given the choice himself. This was a mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from the man who had cared for her during her youth, the man who had defied what was expected of him. All for her. She would find her own penance for what she must do later. At this point, she would grant him the honor she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darbinda\", she said, turning to the woman who insisted upon calling herself \"Min\" despite the honor of a new name that Fortuona had given her. It meant \"Girl of Pictures\" in the Old Tongue. \"You have saved my life and possibly that of the Prince of the Ravens. I name you of the Blood, Doomseer. Let your name be venerated for generations to come\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarbinda folded her arms. How like Knotai she was. Stubbornly humble, these mainlanders. They were actually proud—proud—of their lowborn heritage. Baffling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnotai himself sat on a nearby stump, receiving battle reports and snapping out orders. The Aes Sedai battle for the western Heights was descending into chaos. He met her eyes across the small gap between them, then nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was a spy—and Fortuona would be surprised if there was not one—then now was the time to mislead them. Everyone who had survived the attack was gathered around. Fortuona had insisted on having them close, ostensibly for the purpose of rewarding those who had served her well and meting punishment to those who had not. Each and every guard, servant and noble could hear as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knotai\", she said, \"we have yet to discuss what I should do about you. The Deathwatch Guard has charge of my safety, but you have charge of the defense of this camp. If you suspected that our command post was not safe, why did you not speak earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you bloody suggesting that this is my fault?\" Knotai stood up and stilled the scouts’ reports with a gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave you command here\", Fortuona said. \"The ultimate responsibility for failure is yours then, is it not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, General Galgan frowned. He did not see it this way. Others looked toward Knotai with accusing eyes. Noble sycophants; they would blame him because he wasn’t born of the Seanchan. Impressive, that Knotai had converted Galgan so quickly. Or was Galgan telegraphing his emotions purposefully? Was he the spy? He could have been manipulating Suroth, or simply have been a redundant plant if Suroth failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m not taking responsibility for this, Tuon\", Knotai said. \"You are the one who bloody insisted on watching from the camp when you could have been somewhere safe\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I should have done just that\", she replied coldly. \"This entire battle has been a disaster. You lose ground each moment. You talk lightly and joke, refusing proper protocol; I do not think you approach this with the solemnity befitting your station\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnotai laughed. It was a loud, genuine laugh. He was good at this. Fortuona thought she was the only one who saw the twin lines of smoke rising exactly behind him from the Heights. An appropriate omen for Knotai: a large gamble would yield large rewards. Or a great cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve had it with you\", Knotai said, waving a hand at her. \"You and your bloody Seanchan rules just keep getting in the way\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I have had it with you as well\", she said, raising her head. \"We should never have joined this battle. We would be better preparing to defend our own lands to the southwest. I will not let you throw away the lives of my soldiers\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, then\", Knotai snarled. \"What do I care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun about, stalking away. \"Come\", she said to the others. \"Gather our damane. All but those Deathwatch Guards will Travel to our army’s camp at the Erinin, then we will all return to Ebou Dar. We will fight the true Last Battle there once these fools have bloodied the Shadowspawn for us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer people followed. Had the ploy been convincing? The spy had seen her consign to death men who loved her; would that show that she was reckless? Reckless and self-important enough to pull her troops away from Knotai? It was plausible enough. In a way, she wanted to do as she said, and fight in the south instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do that, of course, would be to ignore the breaking sky, the trembling land, and the Dragon Reborn\u0027s fight. These were not omens she could let pass her by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spy did not know that. It could not know her. The spy would see a young woman, foolish enough to want to fight on her own. So she hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One spun a web of possibility around Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand knew this struggle between them—the fight for what could be—was vital to the Last Battle. Rand could not weave the future. He was not the Wheel, nor anything like it. For everything that had happened to him, he was still merely a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, in him was the hope of humankind. Humankind had a destiny, a choice for its future. The path they would take . . . this battle would decide it, his will clashing with that of the Dark One. As of yet, what could be might become what would be. Breaking now would be to let the Dark One choose that future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBEHOLD, the Dark One said as the lines of light came together and Rand entered another world. A world that had not yet happened, but a world that very well might soon come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand frowned, looking up at the sky. It was not red in this vision, the landscape not ruined. He stood in Caemlyn, much as he knew it. Oh, there were differences. Steamwagons rattled down the streets, mingling with the traffic of horse-drawn carriages and crowds walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city had expanded beyond the new wall—he could see that from the height of the central hill he stood upon. He could even make out the place where Talmanes had blown a hole in the wall. It had not been repaired. Instead, the city had spilled out through it.
