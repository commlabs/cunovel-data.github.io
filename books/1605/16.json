{"id":92630,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eI cross my arms, \"I have been having enough for everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat makes her grin at Jake and nod, \"I can imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna laughs, \"I\u0027m going swimming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Me too.\" Meg looks nervously at the camp, \"Well you can\u0027t leave me here now.\" Seeing her face, I glance around the retreat and notice the people are watching me. The blond demon is even gone. He was there a second ago. I had rushed to Meg so fast, I didn’t notice where he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI search the angry faces for the one that I know will die protecting me. He\u0027s there, scowling away at me. I grin at him and walk away from it all, towards the swimming hole. I have dreamt about swimming again for so long. The shower at the first camp was nothing compared to what the swimming hole is going to feel like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the edge of the forest, to the path, but I can feel their eyes on me. The laughing and joking has quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe enter the path and I stop, looking at Meg, \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallows and shakes her head, \"They said you was bad. You was one of them bad ones and you was being sent to the city to live with the others like you. They said Marshall was protecting us all from you. But I swear, I never believed it. I even protected your name but they didn’t care. They believed you was evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurts. I left my mountain home, saved their loved ones, risked my life to protect them all, and I am the evil one. I don’t even have a defense. Marshall somehow knew what I was, what I am. It hurts. I push it down and walk down the path to the swimming hole. I strip my pants and shirt off and toss them aside. I kick my boots off and dive into the water. I see her. Her blonde head of hair is shiny and wet. I push my hands in and swim as hard as I can for her. Her face lights up when she sees mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"EMMA!\" she screams and swims for me. She can swim. I fight the tears in my face, the hate in my heart and the betrayal that’s rotting my guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her little hand is in mine, I pull her into my arms and close my eyes. I tread the water and squeeze the life out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Sarah,\" I sigh, \"You\u0027re safe.\" The attachment feels stronger, like I am linked to her even more than before. I didn’t even know how much I worried about her until this moment. The water ripples around us. I look up to see the kind eyes of Mary. I smile, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"She was amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I saddled you with it all and I think it\u0027s been more than you\u0027ll tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes speak the words she can\u0027t, because the little ears with us don’t need to know about how bad things got around her. Sarah is a sharp girl; she no doubt noticed it all anyway. She\u0027ll tell me later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary clears her throat, \"It was my honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arm around Mary and hug her too. I notice the way I fold myself around them; I\u0027m not so wooden anymore. Things are different about me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah sees Anna and swims to her. I glance at her and Jake diving in and smile. But Mary\u0027s hand on my arm and the tension of her grip, swings my head back around. Her eyes have changed, \"You gotta go. Take her and Meg and get them the hell outta here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it. I knew I had sensed a change. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"Marshall has them all convinced that you are some kind of evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and look back at Jake, Anna, Meg, and Sarah. I feel a ticking start in my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that baby of yours a breeder baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes tell me the truth of the matter. I nod, \"You love him and treat him with kindness, but you aren’t giving him enough rules. The only reason I\u0027m not like those freaks in the city is my Granny and Gramps. They loved me, and my dad Lenny would tan my hide if I got out of line. You need to give him rules or he\u0027ll become like those things in the city. We aren’t right in the head.\" I swim away before she can ask questions. There\u0027s a fire burning in my belly that is making me feel sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb out of the water and pull my dirty clothes on. I notice the way they stink as I pull them on. I miss doing laundry and being clean and being alone. I miss everything but I\u0027m in too deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo is waiting for me on the trail. He knows what I\u0027m about to do. I can see it in his eyes. He nudges me . I shake my head, \"No.\" I scratch his ears and walk past him. He nudges me again, but I continue up the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get back to the camp I see them crowding and talking to Will, who looks angry in a whole new way. I climb onto a stump and whistle. Leo jumps onto the wide stump with me, almost knocking me off of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man glances at me and points, \"You need to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross my arms and wait for them to gather. My belly is churning like something is tearing it out. I almost want to run away, but I need to fix it for my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices rise and the anger approaches. Another man shoves in front of the other people and points, \"You\u0027re a danger to us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his face. His confidence is based upon the other people; he glances nervously at the crowd for support. I lean in to Leo whose hackles are up. He growls at the group. Will is stalking towards me. He scares me way more than the other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman makes her way to the front, \"She saved us, you idiots. She isn’t a danger—she\u0027s a savior. She stopped the farms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice from the back shouts up, \"They burned my town looking for her. She is trouble. We should give her back to them men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings my attention around, \"What men?\" My tone is harsh and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman in the front gives me a frightened stare, \"Men came for you. They were looking for you. They said Marshall sent them here. Told everyone you were unstable and dangerous, not human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stings for a minute, but I swallow it. \"Did they take anyone with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallows and looks down, \"They took a couple of the younger girls. Told us that we needed to replace what you stole from them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach burns more. My heart is picking up in pace. It makes Leo snarl at the closest man. He backs up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"YOU LET THEM TAKE YOUNG GIRLS?\" I shout at the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill gets to the stump and drags me off. I pull my arm from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns and shouts, \"This camp is going to lose its democracy and become a dictatorship, like the other camps in about two minutes. One more person speaks or makes a move, I end that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe looks on the faces of the other people are intense. Some follow him, I can see that, but others are scared of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat almost makes me laugh. I glance at Leo and know it\u0027s probably him and not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will, she needs to leave. She brings danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like screaming, \"I am a person like you. Only I\u0027m not a coward. If some men strolled into camp I would never have let them take girls. I am not an idiot like you. You are pathetic. The minute Will leaves the guards are taken down, so men can stroll into camp? The kids are forced to hide while you pigs make wine and beer and drink too much? The women aren’t safe? What the hell was the point in having a safe haven, if you can\u0027t keep it safe? You should be ashamed of yourselves. I have never harmed you, any of you.\" I turn away and walk to the path. I\u0027m shaking and angry. I don’t try to control the rage I\u0027m feeling, but I know I have to. I crawl into the bushes and sit on a log. My body aches from the pain in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth wraps around me. His fur covers me. I dig my hands in and hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanna go home,\" I sob. Before I feel any sorrier, I hear twigs snapping next to me. I brace for Leo to attack, but he doesn’t. Another person joins our embrace. I smell him instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever want to tell people all the bad things you been through, so they\u0027ll feel sorry for you and be nice to you?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake chuckles, \"They aren’t worth the time it would take, but yeah. I want them to know everything you\u0027ve been through. They believe Marshall is so great and he\u0027s an asshole. He\u0027s hurt you. I wish I had let Will kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink tears down my cheeks and look up at him, \"I don’t have any answers or courage or strength. I\u0027m just me. I don’t know what to do next. I am sad—sadder than I\u0027ve ever been. I think I was so excited to get here, and now that I am, it\u0027s disappointing. Like we got nowhere else to go in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Will standing behind him looking down on us. His face is pained, \"It\u0027s called postpartum. It\u0027s from being pregnant and your body making all the hormones. The baby dying hurts you, emotionally. You don’t even know it. It\u0027s common in women who have miscarriages and abortions. The doc was telling me some of the things we could expect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow and nod, \"I have felt like a giant baby since then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks sick, \"You were pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"They put a baby in there at the breeder farm, when I thought I was going for routine checks. I didn’t even know. They didn’t even tell me they did it. We were there for a couple weeks and we went for routine checks constantly.\" I don’t know why but the sentence makes me ashamed, like I did it somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winces and holds me tighter to him, forcing my head down and kissing the top of it. He\u0027s like Leo, he doesn’t need to talk about, just hug it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to leave here, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes when I hear Will\u0027s voice. I take a deep lungful of Jake, \"I know, but we take everyone, Sarah and Meg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s dangerous.\" His tone is that one where he doesn’t want me to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up and shake my head, \"Something bad is happening here, Will. The women are scared. I\u0027m not leaving Meg and Sarah here. We gotta stop leaving people behind. If we aren’t coming back here, then I\u0027m not hiking that damned hill again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees my face and nods, \"Fine. Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow and look at Jake, \"The new city. You remember the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake\u0027s eyes widen. He looks at Will who is stoic and giving Jake no obvious hints on what to say, so he stammers, \"Uhm…uh…y-y-yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffle and wipe my face, \"None of us is sick. We should pass through the gates easily.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-16.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
