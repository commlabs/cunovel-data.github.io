It scrapes the front of my thighs and calves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s between my thighs again. I feel his erection seeking out the moisture. He rubs it up and down my slit and then thrusts into me with a grunt. I cry out as he pulls my hips back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m almost off the ground. He rocks into me several times hard and fast. His body pounds mine. I\u0027m building up again from the pause in the spankings. He orgasms before I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunts and finishes using me. He pulls back. I\u0027m holding the bed, spent but frustrated. I am close to tears. I don’t even know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ass cheeks are on fire, they match my cheeks. My jaw trembles. He leaves the room before I can even comprehend what\u0027s happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis semen is dripping down my thigh again. I feel dirty but it\u0027s soothed by a sickening, depraved happiness. The pain in my heart is making me happy on a level I never want to explore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms and legs are weak. I feel like I\u0027ve done one of my harder runs. I stand up and fight my legs from buckling. I look around for my underwear but they\u0027re gone, again. I pull on my jeans and shirt. A tear slips from my eye as I get my boots on. I wipe it away and grab my coat. When I get to the doorway my hand almost refuses to grab the handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at the room. It isn’t how I imagined the night panning out. In a place in my heart, larger than I want to admit to, I imagined he couldn’t get enough of me. I imagined those ten texts were him reaching out. Not him checking to make sure I was alive, so he could use me for a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mixed signals are epic and worthy of a girl\u0027s. My heart breaks when I think about leaving Sebastian for this. I know he would never treat me this way. He is the right choice. He is the normal I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, this room is a darkness and a sickness and an underworld that I want no part of. The excitement is there and the forbidden desires but they are chased down with a bitter feeling that I can\u0027t forgive him for. A feeling he has made me want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my phone out and text Sebastian with trembling fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Meet me tomorrow at my dorm. I won\u0027t have this number anymore.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You sure?\u0027 His response is instant. Like he was waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I need you too help me become the girl I want to be. 8pm my dorm. Goodnight.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t respond. I put the phone on the bed and walk to the elevator. I can hear the water in the kitchen. I press the button. I\u0027m frozen. It isn’t the lonely. It\u0027s so much worse. It\u0027s emptiness but it\u0027s also like a world war inside of me. I want to run to him. I want to kiss him and attack him and slap him. I want him to hold me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, I have just an ounce of self-respect left. I don’t want to force him to do it. I want him to want to do it. It doesn’t feel like too much to expect. Too much to ask for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave.\" He speaks softly behind me. The elevator opens. I don’t move. I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also can\u0027t face him. My ass is on fire. My jeans are making my cheeks sting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begged him to humiliate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t look at him when I say it, \"I don’t want your money anymore. Or anything. I\u0027ll make it work on my own.\" I step in as the door is closing. I hear him leap and press the button but I press the M and collapse against the wall. I\u0027m a sobbing wreck when the elevator moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dings and I miss it somehow. The door closes. I don’t push any buttons. I curl into a ball in the corner. It opens again. Feet step in. Matte leather shoes with squared tips and dark-grey dress pants. I hear him push a button. I want to kick his feet out from under him but I\u0027m frozen in terror. Not of him, but of me. Me and the dark places I will allow myself to be taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bends down and picks me up off the floor. He holds me to his chest and kisses the top of my head. He walks into the apartment when the doors open again. It\u0027s dark and warm but I\u0027ve never been in a colder room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carries me to a room. He flicks on a light. It\u0027s a huge master bathroom. He turns on the shower. I flinch. He pulls my coat out of my hands and lifts my arms in the air. He pulls my shirt off and my bandeau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Please don’t.\" I whisper. He undoes my jeans and pulls them down. He kneels and removes my boots and jeans. He kisses the front of my thigh once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes look dead. Like how mine used to look, before he beat the ever-loving hell out of me and woke me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me expectantly. I reach up and undo the buttons of his dress shirt. What\u0027s underneath is so different from what\u0027s on the outside. He\u0027s always dressed like he\u0027s attending meetings all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath he has a huge cross tattoo done in almost Celtic looking artwork. The banding is thick and winding. The top of the cross is just under his left pec. The t of the cross spans the bottom of his entire left rib cage. The bottom of the cross goes from the t on his pec to his hipbone. A name is delicately sketched onto the cross in the very middle. I trace it with my fingertips. The name doesn’t belong to me and it doesn’t feel like it\u0027s mine. For the first time in my life, the name of the dead doesn’t belong to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull his shirt off and notice the scars along his bicep. They run thick and deep. When I touch them they slow my stroke like a speed bump would. I undo his zipper slowly and gently. I slide his pants past his groin and knees. I drop to my knee and lift his feet to remove his shoes and socks. There is huge scar on his left thigh. It\u0027s massive. I can see the staple marks. Like Frankenstein would have. His body is hard but not chiseled or sculpted the way Sebastian\u0027s is. It\u0027s meaty though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get these scars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hard on myself as a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave it at that and run my finger along it, but he stops my hand and lifts me off the ground. The bathroom is humid and filled with steam from the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps in and pulls me to him. He presses my head against his cross. Her cross. Our cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shower was steamy and relaxing. I felt like he let me in by letting me see his scars and tattoos. He has seven tattoos. They\u0027re not all huge like the cross but they\u0027re bigger than I would have imagined. His back ribcage has a quote. I peel back the covers of the blankets he has wrapped us both in and look at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you prick us do we not bleed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you tickle us do we not laugh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you poison us do we not die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Shakespeare. I remember it from Lit. I brush my hands across the words and wonder if he will ever find peace. His hand moves like a snake and snatches mine. He pulls it up and turns his face and kisses the back of it. \"Go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I can\u0027t. Someone got me all worked up and now I\u0027m kind of buzzing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin plays upon his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came. In case you forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"I forgot. I think you should remind me how it felt, jog my memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I think I like you how you are now.\" He opens his eyes and looks at me, \"Do you want me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the pathetic face I know I\u0027m wearing. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you say?\" He\u0027s being cocky. He wants me to beg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy natural instinct is to fight against him when he\u0027s being that way. Acting submissive is not a natural state for me. It\u0027s there from the torture. I don’t fear him anymore and have a harder time submitting to his attitude. I rip my arm from him and climb from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk and walk to his closet. I pull a pair of jogging pants and a t-shirt from the shelves of the huge walk in. I walk out and pull my long hair into a bun and tuck the ends in to make it stay. It won\u0027t but it gives me something to do with my hands, beyond scratch his eyes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going? In my clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t miss them. You don’t wear anything but Armani. I\u0027m pretty sure these are from Old Navy. You probably didn’t even know you had them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts, \"Get back here.\" His tone is the one from the chair. I smirk and shake my head. My legs break into a run. I grab my jacket and boots and bolt for the stairs. I unlock the door to the stairs and pull it open fast. I can see him running in his boxers. I fly down the stairs barefoot and out into the lobby. I can hear the elevator. I\u0027ve played this game before. I tug on my boots and run out the front door as the valet opens it. My boots slip a bit in the snow. I tug on my coat and let the fresh air wash me clean of the shame I\u0027m battling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah.\" He shouts, barefoot from the awning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back and wave, \"Goodbye Eli. It was nice seeing you again.\" I shout into the blizzard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for me. Give me one minute. Please.\" He yells back and then he\u0027s gone. He sounds angry and demanding but he said please and he never says it. It makes butterflies in my tummy. I pull my hood up and tug on my mitts. His jogging pants are warmer than my jeans but I still don’t wait long. I turn and start to walk. I hear him come jogging up beside me. I glance at him and sigh. He looks sexy in his hoodie and sweats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, \"I like casual Eli. I mean don’t get me wrong, I like the suits and dress pants and groomed thing you have going on, but this is nice too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" He asks looking intimidating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"I want pancakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make you pancakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and turn around to walk backwards, \"I don’t want your pancakes. I want normal pancakes. Not head game pancakes. Not maybe I\u0027ll make you happy or maybe I\u0027ll scare the shit out of you. You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squints, \"You\u0027re awfully playful and free suddenly. Where is the girl from the elevator?\" His voice is mocking my pain and embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jam my mitts into my pockets and shrug, \"She\u0027s in here. I think there are a few of us in here. Besides, I\u0027m on to you. I see your ploy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"Ha. You think you do.\" He does something I don’t expect. \"When I was a kid I used to do this all the time. My dad would take us to our cabin in Aspen and I would do anything to not be with them. When Emalyn was gone they canceled their divorce. They stayed together, hating each other and drinking. I would stand out on the deck and catch snow flakes till I was nearly frozen solid.\" He tilts his head back and lets the snow fall on his tongue. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-29.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
