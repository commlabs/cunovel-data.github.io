You don\u0027t want things under a dome to always be the same.\u0026nbsp; Today though, they made it just a little too cold and worked up a wind, besides. I think it\u0027s about time someone complained to weather control.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Êèë don\u0027t know that it\u0027s weather control\u0027s fault,\" said Seldon. \"It\u0027s getting harder to control things in general.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I know. Deterioration.\" Raych brushed his thick black mustache with the back of his hand. He did that often, as though he had never quite managed to get over the few months during which he had been mustacheless in Wye. He had also put on a little weight around the middle and, overall, had come to seem very comfortable and middleclass. Even his Dahl accent had faded somewhat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He took off his light coverall and said, \"And how\u0027s the old birthday boy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Resenting it. Wait, wait, my son. One of these days, you\u0027ll be celebrating your fortieth birthday. We\u0027ll see how funny you\u0027ll think that is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Not as funny as sixty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Stop joking,\" said Manella, who had been chafing Raych\u0027s hands, trying to warm them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon spread his own hands. \"We\u0027re doing the wrong thing, Raych. Your wife is of the opinion that all this talk about my turning sixty has sent little Wanda into a decline over the possibility of my dying.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Really?\" said Raych. \"That accounts for it, then. I stopped in to see her and she told me at once, before I even had a chance to say a word, that she had had a bad dream. Was it about your dying?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Apparently,\" said Seldon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Well, she\u0027ll get over that. No way of stopping bad dreams.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m not dismissing it that easily,\" said Manella. \"She\u0027s brooding over it and that\u0027s not healthy. I\u0027m going to get to the bottom of this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"As you say, Manella,\" said Raych agreeably. \"You\u0027re my dear wife and whatever you say-about Wanda-goes.\" And he brushed his mustache again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; His dear wife! It hadn\u0027t been so easy to make her his dear wife. Raych remembered his mother\u0027s attitude toward the possibility. Talk about nightmares. It was he who had the periodic nightmares in which he had to face down the furious Dors Venabili once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46725.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:45:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:45:24 AM"}
