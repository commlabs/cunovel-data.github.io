She hushed him with a raised palm and turned back to Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was the fight about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick shrugged. \"Bar fight. They happen. Jeremy and I were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspicion gleamed in her eyes. She turned to Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tavern brawls are sort of like whirlwinds and tornadoes,\" Jeremy said seriously. \"Forces of nature. They erupt out of nowhere for no known cause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved on to Rafe. \"Do I get an answer from you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up both hands, palms out. Innocent as a lamb. \"I wasn\u0027t there, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Nick again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it was your idea that I buy Jeremy a drink,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe planted her hands on her hips. The movement parted the edges of the windbreaker and stretched the tee shirt across her unconfined br**sts. \"So this whole thing is my fault? Is that what you\u0027re trying to say? Don\u0027t you dare blame this on me, Nick Harte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick moved forward again to block his companions\u0027 view. \"You can take me back to where I left my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute, I\u0027m not finished here,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his arms around her shoulders, turned her smartly around, and shoehorned her into the front seat of her car before she could say another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed her back to her cottage and got out of the car to see her to her front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no need to follow me home.\" She shoved her key into the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s after midnight and this cottage is pretty isolated out here on the bluff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Eclipse Bay.\" She turned the key. \"Probably has the lowest crime rate on the entire West Coast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still late. I\u0027d have worried.\" But mostly he would have gone crazy alone in bed tonight, thinking about her. Maybe it was some kind of testosterone hangover, a residual effect of the brawl. Or maybe he was in worse shape than he had realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got the door open, stepped inside, and switched on a lamp. Turning, she studied him from the opening. With the light behind her, it was impossible to read her expression. Her red hair formed a fiery aura around her face. She was doing the enigmatic Fairy Queen thing again. He wanted to put her down on a bed and bury himself so deep inside her that she would never be able to forget that she was as human as he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said, ever so polite. \"As you can see, I\u0027m home, safe and sound. You may leave now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted her so badly he\u0027d probably go out into the woods and howl at the moon if she forced him to leave tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out and gripped the door frame. \"Invite me inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about because I\u0027ve had a hard night and it was, as you have already noted, your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you not to blame that tavern brawl on me.\" She tipped her head a little. \"By the way, you never told me how things went between you and Jeremy this evening. Were you able to work through some of your issues before the brawl erupted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, we definitely rebonded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression softened. \"I\u0027m so pleased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw his opening and put one foot over the threshold. \"Now can I come inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nickâ€”\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward and shushed her with a slow, deep kiss, careful not to touch her. If he put his hands on her, he thought, he might not be able to take them off again. Not before morning, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not retreat. He felt a little shudder go through her. Progress, he told himself. When he lifted his mouth he saw that her lips were soft and parted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what?\" he said. \"I am not in the mood to talk about my issues with Jeremy tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" The tip of her tongue appeared at the corner of her mouth. \"Are you sure you\u0027re all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already asked me that earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know, but you sound a little weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly because I am feeling a little weird.\" Also a little wired, he thought. As if he were running on high-voltage electrical current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027re having some sort of delayed reaction to the violence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her hand. He thought she was going to touch his face, but at the last instant she hesitated, fingertips an inch from his jaw. \"Did you take any blows to the head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t remember.\" He caught the drifting fingertips in one hand and raised them to his lips. \"Could be that I did and it gave me amnesia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick.\" Softer now. And there was a broken edge on his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew one of her fingertips into his mouth and bit gently. She drew in a sharp breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took that as an invitation and glided over the threshold. She moved back to allow him inside. He closed the door behind himself and reached for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was in his arms, clinging wildly, her lips against his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was so worried when Hannah told me there had been a fight,\" she whispered urgently against his neck. \"And then she said you were at the police station and that you\u0027d called Rafe to come bail you out and I got mad. But I was still scared, too. It was awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" he said into her mouth. \"Everything is okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooped her up and carried her toward the hall. There was enough light from the single lamp she had switched on a moment ago to guide him past the darkened bathroom into the shadow-drenched bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first thought when he saw the bed was that it was surrounded with ghosts. Then he realized that he was looking at a lot of pale, gauzy draperies. The hangings spilled from a wrought-iron frame that arched overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hidden bower of the Fairy Queen, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let Octavia slide slowly down the length of his body until she was on her feet once more and then he peeled off the tee shirt. He\u0027d been right about the lack of a bra. Her elegantly curved br**sts fit perfectly into the palms of his hands. He moved his thumbs lightly across her taut ni**les. She closed her eyes. Another little tremor went through her. He felt his own body shudder in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his hands slowly down her sides, savoring the feel of warm, soft skin until he found the elasticized waistband of the long, flowing skirt. Sliding his palms beneath the band, he pushed the garment down over her hips. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-59.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
