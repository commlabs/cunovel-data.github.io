This was what life was like for one such as Lexi, powerful and simple in her wants and desires. She didn\u0027t need any intricate, crazy plans for amassing wealth. She could compel anyone to do anything she asked, and life was incredibly easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was tempting, especially the aspect that was nonviolent. No one was hurt in any of her activities, except financially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi must have read my thoughts because she grinned at me and waggled her eyebrows. \"You should stick with me, my friend. Life like this can be sweet, not a curse,\" she offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, smiling. \"Thanks, but as you keep saying, I have my own path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we made it to the Sutherland mansion, its windows were dark and already draped in festoons of black crepe. In the strange half-light of the early hour, dew sparkled eerily off the matte cloth. The house was cordoned off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gently forced the lock. Neither Lexi nor I made any noise until we came into the living room, when she gave a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coroners had removed the bodies but not done any cleanup work. The vast amounts of blood from their ripped-up bodies had seeped into the carpet and stained the marble floors beneath. Dark black splatters of dried blood covered the walls, matching the crepe outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My god,\" Lexi whispered. \"He massacred them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell back into a chair, overwhelmed with guilt. It hadn\u0027t been long since I had discovered the poor family here, their bodies still warm with rapidly fleeting life. Backward and backward my thoughts ran, remembering the things I had done wrong, all of which had led up to this sad climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hadn\u0027t run away from the reception...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf hadn\u0027t gone along with my brother\u0027s plans to begin with...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hadn\u0027t saved Bridget...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hadn\u0027t fled to New York...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hadn\u0027t made Damon drink blood to complete his transformation...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my fault,\" I moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my head in my hands. The trail of blood and death that wasn\u0027t even of my own devising followed me like a curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s Damon\u0027s,\" Lexi corrected promptly. \"And Klaus\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should never have come here.... I should have stayed as far away from humans as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" Lexi walked over to me, kneeling down and looking up into my face. She put a hand on my chin, forcing me to look back at her. \"You didn\u0027t do this. Klaus did - he ordered this. And you had no intention of marrying into this family. That was Damon\u0027s idea. You told me yourself - he threatened to kill that roomful of people if you didn\u0027t go along. I would have killed him at that point, but he\u0027s not my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed into her dark eyes. \"I\u0027ve done so much wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lower lip. \"You made mistakes in the past. Bad ones. But you know that, and were doing your best to correct them, or at least avoid them in the future. That\u0027s why I am here, Stefan. You\u0027re worth saving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pain that had nothing to do with thirst made my throat ache. \"Lexi, please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see into your heart, Stefan,\" she said softly. \"I don\u0027t just appear out of the blue to save any vampire. You\u0027re different. And someday, maybe, you\u0027ll know that. And part of your curse will be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward and pressed her lips against my cheek. I could feel the soft flutter of her eyelashes as she closed her eyes against my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" she said, backing up and chucking me under the chin. \"We have work to do. I\u0027ll look around down here. You go get whatever things of yours the police haven\u0027t confiscated. I think you\u0027re moving out of this town for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween one breath and the next, between a trick of the light and the deepest shadow, she had changed. Sunny, friendly Lexi now had bloodred eyes and black veins around her face. Fangs glistened in what little light there was. She was in full predator mode, hunting for the slightest sign of the vampire. Even though she was just an older version of what I was, seeing her that way still sent a chill down my body. Lurking just beneath our skin, the monster was always ready to come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a heavy heart I plodded up the grand, dark wood staircase. There was no need to be completely silent; the few servants who remained were in their quarters in a distant wing, far away from the death and mess. I could hear their overloud voices, their discussions of prospects and other households - all desperate attempts to fend off the darkness that their employers had slipped into so suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered what Margaret was doing, vowing to get word to her about Klaus and his vendetta. She was probably in her own home with her husband, mourning her sisters and parents. Which was harder? To be dead, or to live with the memory of the dead? As a vampire, I would never know the former, but always experience the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI soon reached my room, where a night ago Bridget had thrown herself at me. I smelled traces of the violet perfume she had doused herself with. It had infiltrated my pillow and sheets. So much more childish than Katherine\u0027s scent, the subtle, alluring, complicated mix of citrus and spice....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a valise - another gift from Winfield, planning for our honeymoon, I suppose - and threw the few things I considered mine into it. My old clothes, some spare change, my journal. I flipped to an old page where I\u0027d written about Katherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeptember 8, 1864\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is not who she seems. Should I be surprised? Terrified? Hurt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s as if everything I know, everything I\u0027ve been taught, everything I\u0027ve believed in my past seventeen years is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can still feel where she kissed me, where her fingers grasped my hands. I still yearn for her, and yet the voice of reason is screaming in my ears: you cannot love a vampire!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had one of her daisies, I could pluck the leaves and let the flower choose for me. I love her... I love her not... I...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do. No matter the consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this what following your heart is? I wish there was a map or a compass to help me find my way. But she has my heart and that above all else is my North Star... and that will have to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped the book shut, curling my lip at my foolishness. Downstairs was the present reality and thinking about the past did no good. I threw the book into the valise and went downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of finding Lexi there to greet me, there was emptiness and a horrible, familiar scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath and decay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint breeze whistled through broken wood; the back door was left wide open. I shivered despite myself. The silence, Lexi\u0027s absence, howled like a banshee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single piece of paper, the size of a ticket, fluttered on the floor. I picked it up, feeling dread prickle my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll it said was: PAYMENT NUMBER TWO\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- LUCIUS. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-craving-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-24.html","bookId":2075,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:33:20 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:33:20 AM"}
