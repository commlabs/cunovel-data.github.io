It\u0027s not safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fleet engaged the Covenant, but the enemy managed to land ground forces on Reach. We were sent to the surface to protect the orbital-gun generators.\" He stopped, took a deep breath, and continued. \"We were not successful in that mission. Covenant forces overwhelmed our position.\" He glanced back at Kelly and the other Spartans. \"We fell back here. . . we thought it would be secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued down the sloping passage; titanium doors irised open for them and closed as soon as they passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Dr. Halsey replied. \"And Captain Keyes? John?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unknown,\" Fred told her. \"The Master Chief and part of our team attempted to retrieve an unsecured NAV database from an orbital station before the Covenant got to it. Assuming he was successful, and given Captain Keyes\u0027s record of combat against the Covenant...\" Fred\u0027s voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they accomplished their mission and escaped,\" Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey said, finishing the thought for him. \"John has never lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am,\" Fred replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked in silence for a moment past a display of cap- Z tured insurgent flags that had been mounted under glass along the curved concrete wall. Most were emblazoned with an array of gaudy insignia—family crests, bloodied dragons, and scorched crossed swords. They continued past these remnants of a rebel- Z lion the UNSC no longer had to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor Halsey?\" Fred said. \"Permission to speak freely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Granted,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t stand on ceremony, particularly S given the circumstances. Speak your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am, something isn\u0027t normal about this Covenant inva- sion,\" Fred told her. \"They\u0027ve won, but they aren\u0027t glassing the planet. At least not completely—as near as I can determine, they\u0027ve only hit the poles and a portion of the lower latitudes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they had digging equipment in position over this fa- cility,\" Kelly added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curious,\" Dr. Halsey said. \"They\u0027ve never taken an interest in any human or human technologies—\" She halted at a large metal iris, big enough to drive a Warthog through, and set her hand on a palm scanner. \"The medical wing,\" she explained. She spoke into the nearby microphone: \" \u0027I shall do no harm.\u0027 \" The door opened for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh-intensity lights flickered on in the large room beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a dozen medical diagnosis tables and a row of dis- plays along the far wall. The lime-colored floor was brightly polished and sterile. The walls glowed with a faint pink lumines- cence. Seven doors led to adjacent offices and surgical bays with windows looking out into this central room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kalmiya?\" she said. \"Status?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor,\" replied the disembodied voice of her personal AI, her replacement for Cortana. \"I have prepared the Spartans\u0027 personal medical files and sent runners to fetch stocks of blood plasma and other medical supplies from cold storage, as well as tools to assist in the removal of their MJOLNIR armor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors to the tiny service elevator at the far end of the fa- cility opened, and a robotic rover rolled out, its telescopic arms holding piles of liquid-filled bags. Rows of tools were neatly lined up across the rover\u0027s top tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" Dr. Halsey said. \"Continue to track seismic ac-ERIC NYLUNO 123 tivity overhead. Interface with the Spartans\u0027 biomonitors and patch the output to the display on bay three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strolled over to a table, and a bank of holographic dis- plays hummed to life, floating serenely. Graphs and figures scrolled across them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a spotlight here, prepare a sterilization field, and lower the ambient lighting by forty percent. And a little Mahler, please. Symphony number two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor.\" Music drifted from the speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey examined the graphs, tapped tiny human-figure icons, and summoned MRI images of\" the Spartans\u0027 internal structures—holographic bones, organs, and muscles appeared and slowly rotated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced at the extent of their injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred, you have a torn Achilles tendon and three cracked ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth kidneys have moderate contusions.\" She glanced at the rest of the team\u0027s data and after a moment\u0027s consideration told him, \"You\u0027re fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"William, you have a cracked tibia and some internal bleed- ing. Get some biofoam into that wound and avoid strenuous mo- tions for the next day.\" She turned to face Fred and Will. \"You two are in the best shape. I want you to go to Level Aqua, Section Lambda, and retrieve a few things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Fred said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey was only a civilian, but the Spartans had always ac- cepted her authority. Perhaps because she had acted as an equal among the Fleet Admirals and Generals who were constantly trying to co-opt her work. Or maybe it was more than that. She wondered if the Spartans viewed her as some sort of mother fig- ure. As much as this notion amused her, she doubted that they viewed anyone outside their team as family. Not even her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam retrieved a can of biofoam from the rover and in- serted the tip into the tiny injection port in his armor—pushed it through the skin between his fourth and fifth ribs. He filled his abdominal cavity with the space-filling coagulant/antibacterial/ tissue-regenerative polymer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing worth noting, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, not making much over William\u0027s courage. She\u0027d always kept her admiration for her Spartans to herself. The last thing she wanted was to do make them feel different. They got enough \"special\" treatment from everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey picked up a clipboard, tapped a few items onto its display, and handed it to Fred. \"New weapons arrived for field-testing last week,\" she told him, \"as well as parts for the MJOLNIR Mark Five armor system. We\u0027ll swap them out for your damaged components. Kalmiya, show them the way, please, and give them access to the restricted areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor,\" Kalmiya said. The med bay doors opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred studied the items on the clipboard. \"Very, very good,\" he said, and his voice was thick with satisfaction. He nodded, took a long look at his teammates, and then he and Will departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey returned to her medical readouts. \"Vinh, you have a torn deltoid muscle, three broken fingers, and a herniated disk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac, internal contusions and both shoulders have been dislo- cated and reinserted incorrectly, which is pinching off the blood vessels. I\u0027ll get you both fixed up in a moment, but first I want you to survey the route we took here and suggest further perimeter defenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" they replied, cast a look at Kelly, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey concentrated on Kelly\u0027s internal scans. Her injuries were by far the worst. She had seen that from the extremely low blood pressure and high body temperature even before she\u0027d glanced at the MRI. There was moderate bleeding in her liver— a fatal condition if not treated—and her right lung was com- pletely collapsed. That the woman was still on her feet, let alone fighting, was tantamount to an act of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that\u0027s what the SPARTAN-II project was all about, wasn\u0027t it? Playing God for the greater good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor Halsey,\" Kelly asked. \"Where are the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said, they evacuated,\" she replied. \"On the table, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to perform some minor repairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly complied. \"Then why aieyou still here, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey picked up a curved, long-handled magnetic wrench, built specifically to fit this, and only this, access panel. She in- serted it and popped open a fist-sized section of Kelly\u0027s battered ERIC NYLUNO 125 MJOLNIR armor. Blood and hydrostatic gel bubbled from Kelly\u0027s wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I volunteered to be the fail-safe option,\" she told Kelly. \"In the lower levels of these caverns are enough high explosives to level the facility—in case we were ever overrun by the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m here to make sure no one gets access to our technology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey injected a local anesthetic and inserted a flexible laser-tipped catheter into Kelly, carefully monitoring her progress on the MRI. She pulsed the laser, fusing the lacerations in her liver. Dr. Halsey then inflated her lung. Kelly would lose half of that organ, regardless of her treatment. The tissue was already turning blue and mottling necrotic brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kalmiya, prep the flash clone facility and retrieve Kelly\u0027s DNA sequence from the archives. I\u0027d like to get a new liver and right lung started for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fine for now,\" Dr. Halsey lied. \"I just want to get replacements made for you, in case we\u0027re down here for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Kelly rasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey wondered if she did—if Kelly understood that getting shot and burned and having your internal organs trauma- tized wasn\u0027t supposed to happen to you every day... unless you were a Spartan. She wished the war were over. She wished her Spartans had some measure of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor?\" Kalmiya whispered through the tiny private speaker bud in Dr. Halsey\u0027s glasses. \"There is an anomaly in SPARTAN-087\u0027s DNA files. You may want to review this in private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey sealed Kelly\u0027s injuries with biofoam, removed the catheter, and cauterized the incision. \"Rest,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m ready to—\" Kelly tried to sit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down.\" Dr. Halsey set a hand on her shoulder. She had no illusions that she could have stopped Kelly with the gesture—but it reinforced her words and her will. \"Doctor\u0027s orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sighed and lay back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be in my office just over there\"—she pointed to the next room—\"if you need anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey left Kelly and moved to her office. Two walls were covered with giant displays; old disposable coffee cups littered the floor; a holographic projector flooded with data, lines, rotat- ing graphics, and unanswered correspondence overflowed her desk. She turned down the blinds that separated her office from the medical bay, but only halfway, so she could keep an eye on Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have it, Kalmiya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly\u0027s medical history scrolled across a display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" Kalmiya said, and highlighted a surreptitious data request at the end of the file. \"It\u0027s dated three months ago. That\u0027s Araqiel\u0027s routing code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey picked up the snowglobe off her desk, shook it once, and set it down, watching the swirls of particles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Araqiel? That\u0027s Ackerson\u0027s watchdog, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affirmative, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you trace the request?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done and terminated contact at node FF-8897-Z. Access re- stricted to X-ray level clearance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Restricted?\" Dr. Halsey gave a short, soft laugh. \"Does that mean anything now? There\u0027s no one here to stop us, is there, Kalmiya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Entering those files without proper clearance is a treasonable offense, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can come and arrest me, then. Do as I have instructed, Kalmiya,\" Dr. Halsey said. \"Override your ethics center subroutine four-alpha. Nullification code: \u0027Whateverittakes.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey found a half-full cup of coffee on the floor and gin- gerly picked it up. She sniffed its contents and, satisfied it wasn\u0027t rancid, swirled it once then downed its cold contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor. Working. Done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalmiya was Cortana\u0027s older \"sister.\" Dr. Halsey had designed and tested the software intrusion routines on her. Once the process had been debugged and streamlined, she\u0027d incorporated the routines into Cortana. The brass in ONI Section Three had been quite explicit in their instructions to destroy any prototype routines—an order that Dr. Halsey had promptly disobeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is an unusually voluminous amount of counterintru-sion software, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me,\" Dr. Halsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holographic display flickered and solidified into colored crystal blocks representing the code barriers. Dr. Halsey traced a seam with her forefinger along a shard of ruby to the ninety-degree angle made by a stair-step-cut emerald. \"This data cluster here. Spike that and backfill with a neutralizing pulse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holographic crystal shattered into a thousand glittering fragments and swirled upward into a helix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shards pulsed and coalesced. Facets and hard shimmering planes fit together into curled horns, an elongated jaw, and over- sized eyes that flickered with holographic fire. It turned and smiled at Dr. Halsey, baring razor jags of teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Civilian consultant 409871,\" it said in a deep bass rumble that contained a crackle of thunder. \"Doctor Catherine Halsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Araqiel,\" she muttered. \"Did your master leave you behind when he was reassigned? Don\u0027t you have anything better to do than steal data from my SPARTAN program?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor leaned toward a side display and, without looking, tapped in line commands, accessing the base\u0027s root directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are in violation of UNSC military security code 447-R27,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAraqiel stated with a growl. \"This has been recorded and the proper authorities have been notified. You will cease and desist all activities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey snorted and continued to type. \"I\u0027m the only au- thority left here, Araqiel.
