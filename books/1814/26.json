Billy was f**king furious. I was with him the day he stole a white Camaro from the Walgreen’s parking lot. I followed him in the Thunderbird to a chop shop in Cleveland, where he got paid three hundred dollars for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust enough to pay for the abortion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could’ve gone to Amelia, but Delores was just too ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we went to the clinic ourselves. And I held Delores’s hand the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Billy dropped us off at my house. Then he went looking for Garrett Buckler. When he found him, Billy broke his arm and fractured his jaw. And he told him if he ever breathed a word about Delores to anyone, he’d come back and break his other four appendages—including the one between his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo this day, it’s the best-kept secret in Greenville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what? Fuck him. You make good cash, so you sure as shit don’t need his money. And as for the whole dad thing? Overrated. You had a father for like, five minutes . . . me and my cousin never did. And the three of us turned out great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe rethinks that statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay—maybe not Delores. But still—two out of three ain’t bad. We could—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off. “I think I’m gonna get an abortion, Billy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe goes silent. Totally. Utterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his shock and disappointment pound loudly—like a big bass drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe that’s just my own guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember about twenty years ago, when that Susan Smith lady drowned her two children, because her boyfriend didn’t want a woman with kids? Like the rest of the country, I thought she should’ve been strung up by her fingertips and had the skin scraped off her body with a cheese grater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, what kind of woman does that? What kind of woman chooses a man over her own flesh and blood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA weak one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s a characteristic I’ve already admitted to, remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been in my mind for a while now—like a cobweb that’s clinging to a corner but you walk on past because you just don’t have the time to deal with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a businesswoman, first and foremost. I’m analytical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one of my investments isn’t turning out the way I thought it would? I get rid of it. Cut my losses. Simple mathematics—if you take the emotion out of it, it’s a no brainer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. I know what you’re thinking. But what about that little boy you pictured? That beautiful, perfect boy with dark hair and the smile you love?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is, there is no little boy. Not yet. Right now, it’s nothing more than a cluster of dividing cells. A mistake that’s standing in the way of me and the life I was supposed to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if Drew and I can ever get back to where we were—but I know giving birth to a child he obviously wants nothing to do with isn’t going to win me any points. And it would make everything so much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike getting my eyebrows waxed. A simple procedure for a lifetime of convenience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think that makes me a cold bitch, don’t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah . . . well . . . I guess you’re right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly’s voice is cautious. hesitant. Like he doesn’t want to ask the question, and he wants to hear the answer even less. “For him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re gonna get an abortion because of him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wipe at the wetness on my cheeks. I didn’t even know I was crying. “I can’t do this on my own. Alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always comes back to that, doesn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly grabs my hand. “hey. Look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his eyes are burning. With tenderness. And determination. “You are not alone, Kate. And you never will be. Not as long as I’m breathing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my lip. And shake my head slowly. And the lump in my throat makes my voice raspy and frail. “You know what I mean, Billy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he does. Billy understands better than anyone, because he was there. he knows how hard it was, how bad it felt. All those nights when I went out with him, for ice cream or to the movies— leaving my mother home in an empty house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the awards and graduation ceremonies, when my mother’s face glowed with pride, but her eyes shone with sadness. Because she had no one to share it with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery holiday—New Year’s Eves and Thanksgivings and Easters—when I couldn’t make it home from college, and I’d cry in his arms after getting off the phone with her, because it killed me that she was spending the day by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly was there for all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Amelia. he saw his aunt struggle—financially, emotionally—trying to be two parents in one for him and Delores. he watched her date guy after guy, looking for a Mr. Right who never showed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheirs were the anti-lives. The ones I never wanted for my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, here I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly nods. “Yeah, Katie—I know what you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub my eyes hard. Frustrated. Aggravated . . . with myself. “I just need to make a goddamn decision. I have to figure out a plan and stick with it. I just . . .” My voice breaks. “I just don’t know what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly breathes deep. Then he stands up. “All right, screw this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe walks around the corner and digs into the cabinet under the kitchen sink. I have no idea what he’s looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean? Go where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe pops up holding up a screwdriver. “To the place where our problems can’t touch us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly pulls the truck into the parking lot. And the headlights illu-minate the huge darkened sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you see it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROLLER RINK We climb out. “I don’t think this is a good idea, Billy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk to the side of the building. here’s some advice I learned young: When you’re walking in the dark? Or running from the cops through the woods? Step high. It’ll save your shins and the palms of your hands a world of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we’re adults now. This is breaking and entering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was breaking and entering when we were seventeen too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get to the window. I can just barely make out Billy’s face in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But I don’t think Sheriff Mitchell’s going to be so quick to let us off the hook now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe scoffs. “Oh, please. Amelia said Mitchell’s been bored out of his gourd since we left. he’d kill for some excitement. Kids today . . . too lazy. There’s no creativity to their vandalism.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-26.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
