I could listen to you talk forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could never do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed at him. He brought his lips to her ear. “Your scent is like violets in early spring,” he whispered. Then he laughed at himself because though it was true, he sounded like the worst kind of fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was Vale a good Blood Lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria was too eager to learn about her Sense to sleep so they walked into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good. Vale is calm. He thinks things through. He’s patient with people. I think . . . I think if it weren’t a time like this . . . he would be the best man to lead the tribe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that had held him back from making a challenge for Blood Lord, as much as his fear of hurting Talon, Perry realized. He still couldn’t believe his brother had been captured. “He wasn’t going to go after Talon,” he said, remembering the last time they’d been together. “Vale said it meant risking the tribe’s safety. It’s the reason I left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you think Vale changed his mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” he said. Vale had never put anything above the good of the tribe before, but Talon was his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re together. Will you still try to bring them to the outside?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talon is being cared for,” she said. “You saw him. He has a chance to live in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not giving up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria slipped her hand into his. “Even if it’s better for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you saying I should let him go? How could I do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I’m trying to figure out the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry stopped. “Aria . . .” He was going to tell her he’d rendered to her. That nothing was the same anymore because of her. But what difference would it make? They only had three more days together. And he knew she had to go home. He knew exactly how much she needed her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took his other hand. “Yes, Peregrine?” After a moment, she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself smiling too. “Aria, I don’t understand how you can be so chirky right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just thinking. Soon you’ll be Peregrine, Blood Lord of the Tides.” She swirled a hand in the air as she said it. “I just love how it sounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry laughed. “Spoken like a true Aud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria heard song everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting in the trees. Rumbling in the earth. Drifting on the wind. It was the same terrain, but she saw it differently. When she looked into the distance, where she’d seen nothing before, she now imagined the father who might be there. A man who would hear the world as she did, in endless tones. He was an Audile. That was the only thing she knew about him. Strangely, it felt like a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA day after she’d discovered her ability, she noticed her own footfall growing quieter. Somehow, without consciously thinking of it, she’d begun to choose her steps with greater care. When she mentioned it to Perry, he grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I noticed that too. Easier to hunt,” he said, patting a hare strung over his shoulder. “Most Auds are quiet as shadows. The best end up as spies or scouts for the larger tribes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously? Spies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe practiced sneaking up on Perry, determined to succeed where she’d failed before. The morning before they were to reach Bliss, she pounced on him, throwing her arms around his neck as she planted a kiss on the blond scruff over his jaw. Finally she had accomplished the Spontaneous Kiss. She expected him to laugh and kiss her back. He didn’t do either. He wrapped his arms around her and rested his head on top of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should we rest?” she asked, feeling his weight settle onto her shoulders. She could see the hills where Bliss was supposedly nestled on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry straightened. “No,” he said. His green eyes were tight, like the day was too bright for him. “We have to keep going, Aria. I don’t know what else to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did she, so they walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the hills late in the afternoon. They climbed one and another, and then almost suddenly, there stood Bliss, a man-made mountain amid earthen hills. Aria had never seen a Pod from the outside but knew the largest dome at the center would be the Panop. The off-shooting structures were the service domes, like Ag 6. She’d spent seventeen years in Reverie’s Panop. Contained in one place. It seemed unbelievable to her now. With daylight fading, the Pod’s deep charcoal shape was fast blending into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry shifted his weight at her side, silent as he took in the scene. “Looks like a rescue. There are Hovers . . . thirty or so, and a bigger craft. At least fifty people out in the open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her, what he described was just a smattering of dots next to Bliss, lit within a circle of light. The soft drone of engines carried to her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want to do?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get closer.” They moved quietly across the dry grass, stopping when they reached a rocky perch. Now Aria saw a large square opening in Bliss, a wide-open cavity on the smooth walls of the Pod. The Guardians who came and went wore sterile suits. She knew what that meant. The closed environment was compromised. She’d expected this, but numbness seeped through her limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry cursed softly beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a black cart down there,” he said, his expression pained. “Some sort of truck, close to the Pod.” She saw it. It was in miniature, but she saw it. “There are people—bodies on board.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes blurred. “Can you see any of their faces?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Perry wrapped his arms around her. “Come here,” he whispered. “She could be anywhere. Don’t give up now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat on the rocks side by side as she forced herself to think. She couldn’t walk out of the darkness and announce herself a Dweller. She needed to come up with a plan. She took her Smarteye from her satchel. It hadn’t helped her reach Lumina at Marron’s, but it would be useful now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stared at the small black point in the distance. She’d waited enough. She knew what she needed to do. “I have to get down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You can’t. They’d kill you if they saw you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned like the words hurt him physically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Tides need you to be Blood Lord, Perry. I have to go alone. And I need your help up here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told him her idea, describing the disguise she hoped to find and the way she would slip back in. He listened, his jaw rigid, but he agreed to do his part. Aria stood and handed him Talon’s dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said. “You might need it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the knife, her throat tight with emotion. No roses or rings with him, but a knife with feathers carved into the handle. A knife that was part of him. She couldn’t accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This won’t help me down there,” she said. She didn’t want to hurt anyone. She just wanted to get back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry slipped the knife into his boot, but he wouldn’t look at her when he straightened. He crossed his arms and uncrossed them, and then brushed the back of his hand across his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perry . . . ,” she began. What could she say? How could she possibly describe what she felt for him? He knew. He had to know. She hugged him, pressing her eyes closed as she listened to the solid beat of his heart. His arms tightened as she drew away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time, Perry.” He let her go. She took a step back, taking in his face one last time. His green eyes. The bend in his nose and the scars on his cheek. All the tiny imperfections that made him beautiful. Without a word, she turned and made her way downhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like she was floating as she skimmed over the grass toward Bliss. Don’t stop, she told herself. Keep going. She was downslope in an instant, taking cover behind a row of large crates labeled CGB RESCUE \u0026amp; RECOVERY in reflective lettering. Engines buzzed loudly in her ears. She couldn’t catch her breath. Don’t turn around. She forced herself to focus on the scene before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights erected on cranes electrified the area with a sharp glare. To her right, she saw the massive mobile structure that appeared to be the heart of the operation, an angular and clumsy craft compared to the pearl blue Hovers nested around it. The curving gray walls of Bliss soared skyward to the left, smooth, broken only by the gaping rift she’d seen from above. A dozen Guardians roamed in the dirt field between. Then she spotted her target. The black truck was parked by several Hovers that sat in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother couldn’t be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 40\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEREGRINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s eyes locked onto Aria as she huddled by a line of crates in the darkness below. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t blink. What had he done? How could he let her go alone? He knew she was waiting for the right moment to move, but every second that passed, he came closer to sprinting down to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guardians retreated into the rescue center, their work winding down as the night deepened. Perry tensed when the perimeter lights shut off, leaving only an illuminated path to the rescue center. He hadn’t expected that, but it would help them. Finally, when everything was still, Aria straightened from her crouch and dashed through the darkness toward the black truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gut twisted as he watched her climb into the bed. Perry could see the tangle of limbs clearly. A dozen people, by his guess. He watched her search through the dead for her mother. He watched with his legs shaking and an ache like a rock caught in his throat. Was this it? Was she going to find Lumina like this? A body, left out in the cold?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed the part of him that wished she’d find her mother this way. It was the only chance Aria would ever return to him. But then what? Wasn’t this what he wanted? For her to go home so that he could return to the Tides?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t bear it, standing there, doing nothing. What was happening? How was she feeling? He’d known every small shift in her temper for days. Now he didn’t know anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria dropped something over the side of the bed. A bulky suit like the Guardians wore. Boots. A helmet. Then she hopped down to the ground and scurried under the truck. He couldn’t see her now but he knew she was undressing in the cramped space, putting on the Dweller clothes. He knew what that meant. She hadn’t found her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crept from beneath the truck in the suit, a Dweller again. Aria pulled on a helmet and then wove her way through the darkness, drawing as close as she could to the rescue unit. Perry moved within range. There were only two men there now, standing by the entrance ramp. He knew it was as good a chance as they’d ever get, and so did she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria crawled closer, only a few paces away from the ramp, then she turned uphill toward him and signaled that she was ready. It was his move now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry nocked the arrow, his arms steady and sure as he aimed high, to the spotlight that shone down on the entrance. He wouldn’t miss. Not this time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/under-the-never-sky-under-the-never-sky-1/page-41.html","bookId":1657,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:20 PM"}
