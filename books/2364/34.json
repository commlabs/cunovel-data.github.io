What reason would she have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand why you practice every day. You\u0027re not giving a concert now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to go. I want a husband. Not a part-time...It\u0027s not as though you were some kind of traveling salesman...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She accused me of stealing the diamond bracelet you gave her...She would do anything to hold on to you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ellerbee: \"Are you thinking of cutting back on your concerts?...I had a talk with Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 1 Police Plaza a meeting was in progress with the district attorney, the police commissioner, and Lieutenant Mancini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district attorney was saying, \"We\u0027re not dealing here with Jane Doe. The lady has a lot of clout. How much solid evidence do you have, Lieutenant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMancini said, \"I checked with personnel at Cameron Enterprises. Jesse Shaw was hired at the request of Lara Cameron. I asked them if she had ever personally hired anyone on the construction crew before. The answer was \u0027no.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a rumor that a construction boss named Bill Whitman was bragging to his buddies that he had something on Lara Cameron that was going to make him a rich man. Shortly after that he was killed by a crane operated by Jesse Shaw. Shaw had been pulled off his job in Chicago to go to New York. After the accident he went right back to Chicago. There\u0027s no question but that it was a hit. Incidentally, his airline ticket was paid for by Cameron Enterprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the attack on Adler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same MO. Shaw flew in from Chicago two days before the attack and left the next day. If he hadn\u0027t gotten greedy and decided to pick up a little extra money by pawning the watch, instead of throwing it away, we never would have caught him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police commissioner asked, \"What about motive? Why would she do that to her husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to some of the servants. Lara Cameron was crazy about her husband. The only thing they ever quarreled about was his going away on concert tours. She wanted him to stay home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now he\u0027s staying home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district attorney asked, \"What\u0027s her story? Does she deny it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t confronted her yet. We wanted to talk to you first to see if we have a case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that Philip Adler can identify Shaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you send one of your men over to question Lara Cameron? See what she has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was in a meeting with Howard Keller when the intercom buzzed. \"There\u0027s a Lieutenant Mancini here to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara frowned. \"What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Mancini was treading on delicate ground. Without hard evidence, it was going to be difficult to get anything out of Lara Cameron. But I\u0027ve got to give it a try, he thought. He had not expected to see Howard Keller there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve met Howard Keller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly have. Best pitching arm in Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you?\" Lara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the tricky part. First establish that she knew Jesse Shaw and then lead her on from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve arrested the man who attacked your husband.\" He was watching her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have? What...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller interrupted. \"How did you catch him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He pawned a watch that Miss Cameron gave her husband.\" Mancini looked at Lara again. \"The man\u0027s name is Jesse Shaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was not the faintest change of expression. She\u0027s good, Mancini thought. The lady is really good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara frowned. \"No. Should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s her first slip, Mancini thought. I\u0027ve got her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He worked on the construction crew of one of your buildings in Chicago. He also worked for you on a project in Queens. He was operating a crane that killed a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pretended to consult his notebook. \"A Bill Whitman. The medical examiner put it down as an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara swallowed. \"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could go on, Keller spoke up. \"Look, Lieutenant, we have hundreds of people working for this company. You can\u0027t expect us to know them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know Jesse Shaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And I\u0027m sure Miss Cameron...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather hear it from her, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said, \"I\u0027ve never heard of the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was paid fifty thousand dollars to attack your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I can\u0027t believe it!\" Her face was suddenly drained of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m getting to her, Mancini thought. \"You don\u0027t know anything about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was staring at him, her eyes suddenly blazing. \"Are you suggesting...? How dare you! If someone put him up to that, I want to know who it was!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So does your husband, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You discussed this with Philip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later Lara was flying out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara reached the penthouse, Philip was in the bedroom packing, clumsily because of his crippled hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip...what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face her, and it was as though he were seeing her for the first time. \"I\u0027m leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? You can\u0027t believe that...that terrible story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more lies, Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m not lying. You\u0027ve got to listen to me. I had nothing to do with what happened to you. I wouldn\u0027t hurt you for anything in the world. I love you, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face her. \"The police say that the man worked for you. That he was paid fifty thousand dollars to...to do what he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know anything about it. I only know that I had nothing to do with it. Do you believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara stood there for a long moment, then turned and blindly walked out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip spent a sleepless night at a downtown hotel. Visions of Lara kept coming to his mind. \"I\u0027m interested in knowing more about the foundation. Perhaps we could get together and discuss it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you married?...Tell me about yourself...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I listen to your Scarlatti, I\u0027m in Naples...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dream a dream of bricks and concrete and steel, and make it come true...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to Amsterdam to see you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to go with you to Milan...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to spoil me, lady...\" \"I intend to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lara\u0027s warmth, compassion, and caring. Could I have been that wrong about her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Philip arrived at police headquarters, Lieutenant Mancini was waiting for him. He led Philip into a small auditorium with a raised platform at the far end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All we need is for you to identify him in the lineup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they can tie him in with Lara, Philip thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were six men in the lineup, all roughly the same build and age. Jesse Shaw was in the middle. When Philip saw him, his head began to pound suddenly. He could hear his voice saying, \"Give me your wallet.\" He could feel the terrible pain of the knife slashing across his wrist. Could Lara have done that to me? \"You\u0027re the only man I\u0027ve ever loved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Mancini was speaking. \"Take a good look, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be working at home from now on. Philip needs me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Adler...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to get you the best doctors in the world...\" She had been there for him every moment, nurturing him, caring for him. \"If Mohammed won\u0027t go to the mountain...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you point him out to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I married you because I was wildly head over heels in love with you. I still am. If we never make love again, it will be fine with me. All I want is for you to hold me and love me...\" And she had meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the last scene in the apartment. \"I had nothing to do with what happened to you. I wouldn\u0027t hurt you for anything in the world...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Adler...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police must have made a mistake, Philip thought. By God, I believe her. She couldn\u0027t have done it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMancini was speaking again. \"Which one is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Philip turned to him and said, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told us you got a good look at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell me which one he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" Philip said. \"He\u0027s not up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Mancini\u0027s face was grim. \"You\u0027re sure about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip stood up. \"I\u0027m positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess that\u0027s all, Mr. Adler. Thanks a lot for your cooperation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to find Lara, Philip thought. I\u0027ve got to find Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was seated at her desk, staring out the window. Philip had not believed her. That was what hurt so terribly. And Paul Martin. Of course, he was behind it. But why did he do it? \"Do you remember what I said about your husband taking care of you? He doesn\u0027t seem to be doing a very good job. Someone should have a talk with him!\" Was it because he loved her? Or was it an act of vengeance because he hated her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller walked in. His face looked white and drawn. \"I just got off the phone. We lost Cameron Towers, Lara. Both Southern Insurance and Mutual Overseas Investment are pulling out because we can\u0027t meet our completion date. There\u0027s no way we can handle our mortgage payments. We almost made it, didn\u0027t we? The biggest skyscraper in the world. I\u0027m...I\u0027m sorry. I know how much it meant to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara turned to face him, and Keller was shocked by her appearance. Her face was pale, and there were black circles under her eyes. She seemed dazed, as though the energy had been drained from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara...did you hear what I said? We\u0027ve lost Cameron Towers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she spoke, her voice was unnaturally calm. \"I heard you. Don\u0027t worry, Howard. We\u0027ll borrow on some of the other buildings and pay everything off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was frightening him. \"Lara, there\u0027s nothing more to borrow on. You\u0027re going to have to file for bankruptcy and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howard...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can a woman love a man too much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was dead. \"Philip has left me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt suddenly explained a lot. \"I...I\u0027m sorry, Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a strange smile on her face. \"It\u0027s funny, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m losing everything at once. First Philip, now my buildings. Do you know what it is, Howard? It\u0027s the Fates. They\u0027re against me. You can\u0027t fight the Fates, can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never seen her in such pain. It tore at him. \"Lara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not through with me yet. I have to fly to Reno this afternoon. There\u0027s a grand jury hearing. If...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intercom buzzed. \"There\u0027s a Lieutenant Mancini here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller looked at Lara quizzically. \"Mancini? What does he want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara took a deep breath. \"He\u0027s here to arrest me, Howard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrest you? What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was very quiet. \"They think I arranged the attack on Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous! They can\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, and Lieutenant Mancini walked in. He stood there, looking at the two of them for a moment, then moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a warrant here for your arrest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller\u0027s face was pale. He moved in front of Lara protectively and said hoarsely, \"You can\u0027t do that. She hasn\u0027t done anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Mr. Keller.
