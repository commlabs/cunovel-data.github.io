I suppose that was what happened when the great mystery cursed you to be forever hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed the paper back to Will. \"So what does this mean to us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The legend is about a human-eating human that turns into a beast. We\u0027ve got a werewolf-eating werewolf that turns into a human. Coincidence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Jessie and I said at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill glanced back and forth between us. \"Me, neither.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does it mean?\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to do more research.\" He grabbed a notepad, reached behind his ear for a pencil, then frowned when he encountered nothing but hair. Jessie scooped up one from the floor and handed it to him without comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d be cute, if I were into that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill started thinking out loud and scribbling. \"Last time they needed a werewolf army, formed between the two moons of a blue moon month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew my lunar trivia. I couldn\u0027t be a werewolf hunter and not know it. Two full moons in one month caused a blue moon on the second course - both rare and magical according to many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The night of the blue moon,\" he continued. \"Matchi-auwishuk totem, wolf clan, blood of the one who loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so much,\" Jessie countered. \"It was my blood they were after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the wolf clan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie jerked a thumb at Will. He didn\u0027t notice. He was still scribbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of these days you\u0027ll have to tell me all about that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of these days,\" she agreed in a voice that said very clearly, When hell freezes over.\u0026nbsp; I couldn\u0027t say that I blamed her. I\u0027d never told anyone, not even Edward, the entire truth about my own original werewolf encounter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time we\u0027ve got a werewolf-eating werewolf and...\" Will frowned and stared into space. \"What month is it, Jess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat month is it? Man, he\u0027d drive me crazy. Pretty only goes so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Early October,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Full in eight days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So whatever is going on started around the harvest moon, and if they play according to their usual plan it\u0027ll finish up at the hunter\u0027s moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood moon,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, frowned, focused on my face. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really hate the sound of that,\" Jessie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy family had died on the night of the blood moon, the hunter\u0027s moon. I ought to be making a pilgrimage to their graves, bringing flowers, remembering them. Instead I had a bad feeling I\u0027d be miles away, fighting werewolves. What else was new?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill still stared at me. I stared blandly back. I wasn\u0027t going to tell him why I knew about the blood moon, didn\u0027t plan on ever telling anyone why the full moon in October was the worst kind, at least for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I said as a thought occurred to me. \"Wolves were being killed here, but no one said anything about them being eaten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true,\" Jessie murmured. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean they weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the table and shuffled through the mess, pulling out a file folder. The room went silent as she read through the report. She shook her head. \"There were chunks out of some of the bodies, but nothing like we saw the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we know the wolves were killed by other wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mandenauer checked the bite radius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust Edward to think of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the legend, a Weendigo grows with every meal,\" Will continued. \"The larger he gets, the more flesh needed to satisfy his hunger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re looking for a giant?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that. The growth is most likely theoretical; the hunger is real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Weendigo began with a snack, but now he needs a buffet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basically, yes.\" Will turned his attention back to his notes. \"I have to see if there are any ceremonies that take place beneath the hunter\u0027s moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ojibwe ceremonies?\" Jessie asked, then crossed the room to lay a hand on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill reached up and twined their fingers together. They were always touching each other - both casually and much more than that. Their outright affection made me yearn for something I\u0027d long ago forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I felt for Damien was very different. I wanted him for no other reason than that he was hot and I was horny. Affection, love, forever were not words I could ever use again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any kind of ceremony,\" Will answered. \"Though I\u0027ll start with the Ojibwe, since that was where we struck pay dirt last time. And the whole Weendigo thing points in that direction, as does their location -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere, in the heart of Ojibwe country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned toward the computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should I do?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit blasting them for one thing,\" Jessie snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think? I doubt our friend the Weendigo could have killed nine werewolves on his own. You helped him do... whatever it is he\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, she was right again. But I wasn\u0027t sure I could stop killing them, even if I should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll burn them immediately. My mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie gave an aggrieved sigh, as if she were dealing with a stubborn, wayward child. \"Don\u0027t come whining to me if they take over the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ignored our squabbling and answered my question. \"You two should be checking out any new people in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How new?\" I asked, thinking of Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last few months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t this Weendigo have been here for years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte thought about that. \"Could have been, I guess. I was thinking the werewolf came here for this reason, but maybe he or she is just here.\u0026nbsp; The time is what\u0027s important, not the location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a blood moon every year,\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill flicked a glance first at me, then at Jessie. \"Find out if anything similar has ever happened anywhere else at this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and dialed her cell phone. \"Mandenauer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward, trying to hear his voice. Foolish, but I missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027d refused to let Edward get close to me, fearing superstitiously for his life. But years had passed, he\u0027d faced dangers I didn\u0027t even know about, and he was still kicking. So I\u0027d allowed myself to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie explained what Will had discovered. \"Are there any other recorded instances of werewolf cannibals?\" She listened. \"OK, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. Werewolves have been killed, though rarely, but never eaten. Mandenauer\u0027s concerned. Strange behavior is always a bad thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll question a few elders,\" Will said. \"See what they know about Weendigos. Maybe I\u0027ll get an idea of where to start looking for... something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll check around,\" Jessie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we.\u0026nbsp; Talk to customers in the bar. Make nice. Be friendly.\" She frowned. \"Maybe I should do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill laughed. \"Right, Jess. You\u0027re not a people person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing we had in common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can be a regular Miss Manners if I have to be,\" she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill and I snorted at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie scowled. \"Never mind. Find out who\u0027s new, who\u0027s not. Ask if there\u0027s been anything strange going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unexplained disappearances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you checked the missing persons reports?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped. \"But... that\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Town\u0027s full of transients. No one\u0027s going to report them missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue. But still...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive you back to the bar,\" Jessie said. \"You can ask around there. I\u0027ll take the shops in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come I have to take the bar? I barely drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even better. Alcohol kills brain cells, and you don\u0027t have a lot left to lose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. \"Oh, yeah, you\u0027re going to win them over with your sparkling wit and genial nature. I can see that already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost laughed but caught herself. \"Let\u0027s get this over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half an hour later I stood outside the bar as the tail-lights of Jessie\u0027s squad car disappeared down Good Road. There were a few vehicles in the lot, but not many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked my watch. Nearing four o\u0027clock. Not exactly a hopping time in any tavern. I decided to go upstairs, take the shower I\u0027d missed that morning, check my E-mail, do some paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best bet for hearing anything interesting would be when the bar patrons were inebriated. Besides, I wanted to work a crowded room, not a table full of customers. The more people I could talk to at one time, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped inside, and I knew someone had been there. Damien? Or another?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was out of place. Not really - though I could have sworn I\u0027d left my computer on the kitchen table at an angle and not anally lined up with the corner. However, since I was anal, I might have done that and not even noticed. Nevertheless, I pulled my gun and checked the apartment thoroughly, but whoever had been inside without me was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at my laptop. Even if someone had opened it, turned the thing on, played around, he wouldn\u0027t have found anything. I knew how to protect my files. I\u0027d know that even before I\u0027d taken J-S computer training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, I powered up the machine, did a quick run-through of my data. Everything was there, and I could find no evidence that someone had been tiptoeing through classified information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the computer on. I had work to do. But right now I was starving. When was the last time I\u0027d eaten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday. Maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee sloshed around in my stomach like acid. I opened the tiny refrigerator more out of habit than hope. I\u0027d looked in there this morning, and it had been as empty as my social calendar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how had it gotten full?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked at the food - fruits, vegetables, milk, lunch meat, juice. I straightened and opened the cabinet above the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Praise God, coffee,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as cereal, bread, and cookies. Someone had been in here. The grocery fairy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love the grocery fairy.\" I ripped open the bag of cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien had brought me food. Who else knew I was here? Who else cared?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nature of my life had never bothered me. I had no home; I existed alone. No one would miss me if I didn\u0027t come back from the woods one night. Well, maybe Edward would, but he\u0027d lost agents before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d get over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d lived through devastating loss. I didn\u0027t want anyone to feel the same heartbreak because of me. I wasn\u0027t going to quit doing what I was doing, so I was better off alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after meeting Jessie and Will, watching them together, I missed Jimmy terribly. I\u0027d loved him with all my foolish young heart. I still wasn\u0027t over him. Probably never would be. The life we\u0027d planned to share was one I still dreamed of. When I wasn\u0027t having nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the lost dream, I\u0027d enjoyed being with him, kissing him, touching him. I missed that closeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden memory of Damien cupping my elbow on the porch returned, as did the tug of awareness. I hadn\u0027t had sex since Jimmy died. Obviously a bad choice considering my oversexed reactions of late, but the very thought of intimacy had nauseated me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Damien Fitzgerald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuffed my mouth with cookies, trying to satisfy one need with another. Didn\u0027t work, but at least I wasn\u0027t hungry anymore. For food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo satisfy the nagging voice in my head, I ate an apple, drank a glass of milk. Though I could care less most days if I lived or died, to do my job I had to stay healthy. My body was a killing machine, and I kept it in the best condition I could manage. In addition to jogging, I did sit-ups, pull-ups, push-ups at every opportunity. Needed to work on that upper body strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 9:00 p.m., after a round of calisthenics, followed by the filing of some long-overdue paperwork, I checked my E-mail. Everything was work related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a shower and changed my clothes, opting for tight jeans and a low-cut hot pink tank. I even gelled my hair and put on lipstick. If I wanted information, I might have to practice a few feminine wiles. If I remembered any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad I owned only boots and sneakers. Guys liked high heels, which was why I\u0027d thrown all mine out the day after I was released from the psych ward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d thought I was celebrating my liberation. I\u0027d only been hiding from the truth. The doctors might have certified me sane, but I was still broken down deep where I\u0027d never let anyone see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad,\" I told the reflection in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hot pink Lycra tank top could probably use a necklace to spruce it up, but I\u0027d thrown all my jewelry into the trash with my shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuffed some money, some matches, into my pocket. I no longer owned a purse, either. My jeans were too tight to hide a gun. Damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed from sneakers to boots and concealed my knife. I wasn\u0027t going anywhere without a weapon ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show time!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny, I sounded as thrilled about it as I looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped onto the porch. They were playing jazz again. I had no idea if the tune was old or new, not a clue as to the artist\u0027s name or the title of the song. I wondered if there was anything but jazz in that jukebox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night I\u0027d felt the music out of place, but now the bluesy wail of the brass fit perfectly with the coolness of the night, the shade of the moon, the aura of expectation that hung over the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight days, Will had said. I shivered beneath the muted silver glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think it was going to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-11.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
