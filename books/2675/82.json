Who she was seeing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Other than Brandon?” Laura shrugged. “He’s the last one she was really involved with. It made things kind of awkward on the set.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot exactly news. Cassie had been there. “So what was she thinking before she disappeared? Was she depressed? Anxious? Did you think there was any reason she would take off? Anyone she was scared of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cassie, what do you want from me? If I knew anything about Allie, I’d tell the police or you or Jenna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom?” That surprised Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mothers always worry. So, of course I’d let her know.” She shifted in her chair, as if suddenly uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know you knew her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t, not really, but Allie introduced me once, on the set. It was obvious that she really cared about her kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much was true. And it was obvious that she and Allie shared enough of a bond for Allie to feel comfortable enough to introduce Jenna to her. Cassie tried again. “Are you sure Allie didn’t say anything to you about what was going on in her life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura checked the time on her phone once more. She seemed to wrestle with her conscience then said, “Oh, hell. Look, I really don’t know much . . .” Again she hesitated, then through the dark glasses her gaze found Cassie’s and her voice was almost a whisper. “What I do know, you’re not going to like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s about you, Cassie.” For a second, Laura looked away. “She . . . she was jealous of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jealous of me?” Cassie barked out a short laugh. “Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you wouldn’t believe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allie was successful. On top of the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was she?” Serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course she was. She had her pick of movie roles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura let out a sigh. “It wasn’t about her work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What then? Why would she be jealous of me?” The idea was ludicrous. Allie had always been the baby of the family and as such, both Cassie and Jenna had protected her in their ways and Robert had coddled her. Allie had shined in school and then later in the same profession where she competed with Cassie, always, always crushing her older sister in any audition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always been some kind of competition between you two, hasn’t there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she always came out on top. Always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess it depends upon what you’re vying for.” Laura seemed to become philosophical, her thoughts turned inward. “It happens in every family. My family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have sisters and brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not anymore. I had a sister, but . . . she passed years ago. Freak car accident.” She let out a sigh. “I survived. Felt guilty ever since.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” she said, though she turned a little pensive. “It was a long time ago. But I remember sibling rivalry.” She shot Cassie a look. “It’s never any fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but Allie and I . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just think Allie always wanted what you had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I didn’t have anything . . .” Cassie’s voice faded away slowly. Trent. Allie had never been married. Never come close. Never engaged. A handful of quasi-serious boyfriends, none of which had connected with her until after she’d made her mark in Hollywood, but no one who’d ever wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s ridiculous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura got to her feet. “You asked. If you don’t believe me, talk to Cherise. She was the one who knew her best, who scheduled her appointments, who knew what Allie was doing, who probably even covered for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cherise hasn’t returned my calls. I think she doesn’t want to talk to me. Holly said she’s working for Brandon McNary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I think I heard that, too . . . maybe from Little Bea. I can’t remember, but hey, I really have to go. I can’t help you with Allie.” She was already walking through the doorway into the back of the salon. “I have no idea what happened to her.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-82.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
