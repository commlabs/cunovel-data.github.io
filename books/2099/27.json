He and Cassie were taking an early morning walk out on the bluff before the others woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot.\" Cassie stared off at the horizon as she spoke, imagining herself getting lost somewhere in that line between the ocean and the sky. She didn\u0027t have the heart to tell Adam that Scarlett knew about the cord between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She got me thinking about my power,\" Cassie said. \"I don\u0027t want to live in fear anymore. In fear of myself and what I\u0027m capable of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have to.\" Adam was trying to be supportive, even though Cassie\u0027s dark powers were far beyond his realm of understanding. He was afraid for her and she knew it. In his eyes she could see how much he wished he could take on the burden himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what does Scarlett suggest you do?\" Adam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said if I embrace my dark magic I can learn to control it. Which has obviously been my problem lately. Controlling it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam stepped around Cassie to face her, blocking her view over the bluff. \"Do you think you can learn to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what I think. I\u0027m not sure if I can even trust my own thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam wrapped his arms around Cassie and pulled her in. She could smell the salt water drifting in the air and off his skin. \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what I think. I think we won\u0027t know until you try. And I will stand by you every step of the way, no matter what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it goes badly? What if it changes me, more than it already has?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of us knows what the future holds or who we\u0027ll become, Cassie. But I do know that we can be true to who we are right now. And that applies to me loving you, and you loving me, and to you being able to connect to the light inside of you. That\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam kissed the top of Cassie\u0027s head and then let her go. \"But you also have to trust yourself. You have to have faith in your own fundamental goodness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie nodded. \"I think I\u0027m ready to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, Adam swooped in and kissed her. She almost laughed - it was the last thing she expected him to do at that moment. She had been on the verge of asking him about the brief look he had exchanged with Scarlett the night before, the one that had set her off in an internal jealous rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as she leaned in to kiss him back, she forgot all about that. She could feel the sun on her back and hear the ocean in the distance. Sometimes Adam knew just what to do to make everything all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was groggy from sleep and clinging to coffee mugs when Cassie announced a Circle meeting in the secret room. Faye sat with her bedspread still wrapped around her and even Diana looked like she could have used another hour of rest, but Cassie\u0027s news was sure to wake them right up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve done some thinking since yesterday,\" she said to the group as they gathered round. \"And I\u0027ve decided that Diana should bring my father\u0027s book here for Scarlett to take a look at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlett met Cassie\u0027s eyes and something passed between them, a beat of understanding. But Cassie quickly looked away, breaking the moment. She didn\u0027t want to feel like she had too much in common with her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the spell my father used will work to defeat the hunters.\" Cassie had everyone\u0027s full attention now. \"And Scarlett can translate it for us. She understands the book\u0027s language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll attention spun to Scarlett\u0027s direction. Faye tossed her blanket off like a cape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"Scarlett can translate it for us?\" she repeated. Her green eyes flashed at Cassie. \"That\u0027s a huge responsibility for Scarlett to take on alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye smirked. \"What Diana means is, how do we know we can trust her? If none of us know the difference. She can tell us to do anything she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m trusting her,\" Cassie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Faye was expecting more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s heart thumped and thrashed within her chest, but she maintained her strength and composure. \"And because it\u0027s time to end this, once and for all. Scarlett has no reason to mislead us. She wants to be rid of the hunters just as much as we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear, hear,\" Nick said from his sleeping bag. \"So when and where do we go after them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can help with that.\" Diana shook off the surprise of the prior moment and spoke up. \"Max knows where the hunters assemble. I bet we can infiltrate one of their meetings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can ambush them,\" Nick said. \"When they least expect it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But in exchange,\" Diana deferred to Cassie, \"I ask that the Circle spare Max from whatever the curse will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" Faye shouted. \"There\u0027s no reason to believe Max\u0027s puppy-dog love for Diana is any more real than his feelings for me were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye, we\u0027ve been through this already,\" Melanie said. \"You have to let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to let it go,\" Faye insisted. \"Because it was the same thing - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t the same thing.\" Diana\u0027s cheeks were flushed and her eyes were sharp. \"It wasn\u0027t even close to the same thing. I\u0027ve tried to be nice about this, Faye, but you\u0027re making that impossible. Do you need me to break it down for you? You were using magic to mess with Max\u0027s mind. I have found my soul mate. Do you get the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye defied Diana with a fixed stare. \"As a leader of this Circle I hereby raise the issue of Diana\u0027s inability to be impartial when considering Max\u0027s trustworthiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shut up, Faye,\" Melanie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melanie!\" Cassie shouted. \"You\u0027re out of line. Faye has the floor and she\u0027s raised a legitimate issue to the Circle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana swung around to look at Cassie. \"Seriously? You\u0027re going to let her go with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has a right to voice her concern,\" Cassie said apologetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Cassie.\" Faye stood up to better command the space. She eyed Diana, Melanie, and Laurel, who were clustered on top of Laurel\u0027s bed. Then she turned to Chris, Doug, and Deborah scattered around Nick\u0027s sleeping bag on the floor. And finally she rested her eyes on Scarlett, who was seated off to the side with only Sean nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you all saw in the woods,\" Faye said. \"I was there. I know Max stood up to his father to protect Diana. But I also saw Max leave with his father, as you all did. Not with us. With him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye paused to glare specifically at Melanie before continuing. \"Yet now we\u0027re going to trust Max to tell us where to find the hunters, where to find his father, so we can attack them on their own turf. Do I have to be the one to say it? Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like a trap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie was quiet. They all were. Even Cassie had to admit Faye had a valid argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye?\" Diana said. \"You\u0027re right.\" She took control of the floor. \"I am partial. I do believe Max will truthfully lead us to the hunters, and in good faith I believe he should be spared from whatever negative effects the curse will have. But the rest of you are free to decide for yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana turned to Cassie. \"I propose a vote to declare the Circle\u0027s decision, and I will abstain from that vote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few more seconds of tense quiet, Cassie called on Melanie. \"Will you do the honors, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie rose, cleared her throat, and said in her cool, authoritative tone: \"All in favor of sparing Max if he leads us to the hunters, raise your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Cassie\u0027s surprise, enough hands shot immediately up to decide the vote without counting. Even at a time like this there still seemed to be an inclination among the group to align themselves with Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie beamed with satisfaction. \"The majority of the Circle believes Max can be trusted. And we promise to spare him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Diana said. Cassie wasn\u0027t sure she\u0027d ever seen Diana more sincere, and that was saying something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye shook her head and sneered at her. \"Cry your tears of joy now. But if Max betrays us, neither of you will be spared. I\u0027ll see to that myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie parted her lips to speak but instead found herself looking at Faye, whose eyes reflected a concentrated power. Then she quickly turned her attention to Diana and said, \"I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t come to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cassie wasn\u0027t really sure. Maybe Diana was being naive. Maybe she was, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlett whispered something into Adam\u0027s ear and he nodded. It was getting more and more difficult to determine who was trustworthy anymore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-27.html","bookId":2099,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM"}
