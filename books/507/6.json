They didn’t dare glance at each other for fear they would begin laughing again.

This man made a swift sign to Tip-Top, and placed his finger on his mouth. Tip-Top replied by closing his eyes with his fingers, as if to show that he saw nothing. When he had an opportunity he said to this man:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “‘Tell your master I will be willing to sell the saddle to-night.

Tip-Top laughed as they walked along. ‘This thief,’ he remarked, ‘is a fool. [Pg 77] It is so easy to steal a horse that he will not buy a saddle. He will try to steal mine. Then we shall catch him.

Sometimes a passer-by would pause, look in, and ask what the trouble was. Then the watchers would reply that they were waiting for the great thief who was coming to steal the fine horse.

But just then they heard some one singing far down the street. It was a jolly song, and the sound of it came louder and louder.
