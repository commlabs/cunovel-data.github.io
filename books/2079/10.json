Make fun of them by telling them a truth they won\u0027t believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, she noticed, Quinn looked more as if he didn\u0027t care what they found out than as if he were mocking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. \"Maybe she\u0027s from another world. Did you ever think of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel was confused again. Quinn seemed to be trying to get himself killed. He appeared to be verging\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon telling these girls about the Night World, and under the laws of the Night World, that was punishable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re really slipping, Rashel thought. First the slave trade, now this. I thought you were supposed to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuch a stickler for the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are darker dimensions,\" Quinn was confiding to the group, \"than you have ever imagined. But,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou see, it\u0027s all part of life\u0027s grand design, so it\u0027s all right.

A live caterpillar. And it stays alive, you see, while the eggs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehatch and the little waspettes eat it from the inside out. Now, who do you think invented that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel wondered if vampires could get drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would probably be the most horrible way to die,\" Daphne chimed in, her musical voice ghoulish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being eaten by insects. Or maybe being burned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would probably depend on how fast you burned,\" Quinn said meditatively. \"A flash of fire-high\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough temperature-you bum the nerves out in the first few seconds. Slow baking would be different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m writing a poem about fire,\" Rashel said. She was surprised to find that she was annoyed because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn didn\u0027t really seem to have noticed her. On second thought, she should be annoyed; her plan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edepended on him not only noticing but choosing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to have to capture his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have it with you?\" Daphne was asking helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I can tell you the beginning,\" Rashel said. She braced herself to look at Quinn as she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erecited:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s warmth in ice; there\u0027s cooling peace in fire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd midnight light to show us all the way. The dancing flame becomes a funeral pyre; The Dark was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore enticing than the Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn blinked. Then he smiled, and he looked Rashel over, dearly taking notice of the velvet jumpsuit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand ending with her face. He looked everywhere... except into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right; you\u0027ve got it,\" he said with that same brittle exhilaration. \"And there\u0027s plenty of dark out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere for everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s worry that he might look too deep if he met her gaze was groundless. Quinn didn\u0027t seem to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally seeing anybody here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is plenty of darkness,\" Rashel said. She moved toward him, feeling strangely brave. Her instincts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esensed a weakness in him, a flaw. \"It\u0027s everywhere. It\u0027s inescapable. So the only thing we can do is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eembrace it.\" She was standing right in front of him now, looking at his mouth. \"If we hold it dose, it won\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehurt so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. Exactly.\" Quinn showed his teeth, but it wasn\u0027t the manic smile. It was a grimace. He didn\u0027t look\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappy anymore; suddenly, for just an instant, he looked tired and sick. He was almost leaning away from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came here so I could do that,\" Rashel said in a sultry voice. She was scaring herself a little. In the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ename of the charade, she was doing everything she could to seduce him-but it was surprisingly easy and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esurprisingly enjoyable. There was a sort of tingling all over her body, as if the jumpsuit had picked up a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echarge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to look for the darkness,\" she said. Softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn laughed abruptly. The feverish good humor came flooding back. \"And you found it,\" he said. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent on laughing and laughing, and he reached out to touch Rashel\u0027s cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t let him touch you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought flashed through Rashel\u0027s mind and communicated to her muscles in an instant. Without\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknowing how she knew, she was certain that if he touched her, it would all be over. It was skin-to-skin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econtact that had nearly fried every circuit in her brain before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe danced back from his fingertips and smiled teasingly, while her heart tried to pound its way out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place is so crowded,\" she said throatily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Oh. Then why don\u0027t we schedule something more private? I could pick you up tomorrow night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay seven o\u0027clock in the parking lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Quinn.\" It was Daphne, looking aggrieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me to meet you tomorrow.\" She trembled her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn stared at her, and for once, Rashel could read his face easily. He was thinking that anybody that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estupid deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can both come,\" he said expansively. \"Why not? The more the merrier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away laughing and laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel watched him go, resisting an impulse to shake her head. She\u0027d done it; she\u0027d passed the last test\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand been chosen. So why was her heart still pounding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced out of the side of her eye at Daphne. \"Well, I don\u0027t know about anybody else, but I\u0027ve had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough excitement for tonight.\" She went to get her coat, with the rest of Quinn\u0027s coterie glaring jealously\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafter her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had one enjoyable experience on the way out. Ivan, still slouching, tried to stop her at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shelly, hey. I thought we were going to get to know each other better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel didn\u0027t need him anymore; she had her invitation. \"I\u0027d rather get to know a head louse,\" she said in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher sweet chatty voice, and she stepped on his foot hard with her high heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car, she waited a full twenty minutes, watching the front of the club, before Daphne joined her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, but I didn\u0027t want anybody to think we were leaving together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did a great job,\" Rashel said, driving away. \"You even managed to get both of us invited to meet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn together-that was dangerous, but it worked. The only thing that surprised me is that he invited us in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efront of everybody. Is that how he did it before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not at all. Last time, he sort of whispered it to me when nobody was around. But, you know,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing was normal tonight. I mean, he usually asks new girls questions-I guess to figure out if they have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efamilies who\u0027ll miss them. And he isn\u0027t usually that-that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I wonder what\u0027s going on with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel pressed her lips together and stared straight ahead through the windshield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you want to go through with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sunday night and they were nearing the parking lot of the Crypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you and told you,\" Daphne said. \"I\u0027m ready. I can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. But, listen, if there\u0027s any trouble, I want you to run. Run away from the club and don\u0027t look back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor me. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne nodded. At Rashel\u0027s suggestion, she was wearing something more sensible tonight: black pants\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheavy enough to provide some warmth, a dark sweater, and shoes she could run in. Rashel was dressed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe same way, except that she was wearing high boots. The knife was in one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go first,\" Rashel said, parking a street away from the club. \"I\u0027ll come in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Daphne walk away, hoping she wasn\u0027t going to get this little blond bunny killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe herself was the danger. Quinn was going to use mind control on them to get them to go to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewarehouse quietly. And Rashel wasn\u0027t sure what would happen when he did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust don\u0027t let him touch you, she told herself. You can carry it off as long as he doesn\u0027t touch you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, she started toward the Crypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was in the dark parking lot, standing by a silvery-gray Lexus. As Rashel reached the car, she saw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe pale blob of Daphne\u0027s face through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I almost thought you weren\u0027t coming.\" There was now a sort of savagery mixed in with Quinn\u0027s lunatic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood humor. As if he was angry she wasn\u0027t smart enough to save herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t miss this for the world.\" Rashel kept her eyes on the car. She wanted to get this over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith. \"Are we going somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that tiny hesitation that seemed to come every time she spoke to him, as if it were taking him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea minute to focus. Or as if he were trying to figure something out, she thought nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he answered smoothly, \"Oh, right, get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel got in. She glanced once at Daphne in the back seat. Daphne said, \"What\u0027s up?\" in a chirpy voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elaced with feminine rivalry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was getting in the driver\u0027s side. Once the door was shut, he turned the engine on to run the heater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows immediately began to fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel sat in a state of continuing mind, ready for the unexpected at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the unexpected didn\u0027t come. Nothing came. Quinn was just sitting there in the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sudden void in her stomach that threatened her zanshin, Rashel realized that it was too dark. Too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efamiliar. They were sitting here together in silence, so close, visible to each other only in silhouette, just as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey had in the cellar. She could almost feel Quinn\u0027s confusion as he tried to figure out what was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rashel was afraid to say anything, afraid that her chirpiest voice wouldn\u0027t be a good-enough\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisguise. The horrible feeling of connection was mounting, like some giant green wave looming over them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboth. In a moment it would break, and Quinn would say, \"I know you,\" and switch on the light to see the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface without the veil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s fingers edged toward her knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, through the electric buzzing in her ears, she heard Daphne say, \"You know, I just love this car. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebet it goes really fast, too. This is all so exciting-I\u0027m just so glad I got here this time. Not like last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went on, blathering easily, while Rashel sank back lightheaded with relief. The connection was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebroken; Quinn was now looking at his instrument\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epanel as if trying to escape the chatter. And now Daphne was talking about how exciting it was to ride in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmart, smart girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn had to interrupt her to say, \"So, you two girls want to surrender to the darkness?\" He said it as if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe were asking if they wanted to order pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Rashel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Daphne said. \"It\u0027s just like we always say. I think that would be just the most seriously cool-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn made a gesture at her as if to say, \"For God\u0027s sake, shut up.\" Not a rough gesture. It was more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike an exasperated choir director trying to get through to some soprano who wouldn\u0027t stop at the end of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe measure. Stop here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Daphne shut up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he\u0027d turned off a switch in her. Rashel twisted slightly to look at the backseat and saw that Daphne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad slumped to one side, body limp, her breathing peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, Rashel thought. She was used to the kind of mind control other vampires had tried on her. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epersuasive, whispery-voice-in-the-head type. And when Quinn hadn\u0027t tried to use that, or to call for help\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the cellar, she\u0027d assumed he was low on telepathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she knew the truth. He packed a telepathic punch like a pile driver. No, like a karate blow: swift,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprecise, and deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at her, a dark shape against a lighter darkness. Rashel tried to brace herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the rest is silence,\" Quinn said, and gestured at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel fell into a void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke up as she was being carried into the warehouse. She had enough presence of mind not to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eopen her eyes or make any other sign that she was conscious. It was Quinn carrying her; she could tell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven with her eyes shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he dumped her on a mattress, she deliberately fell so that her head was turned away from him and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher hair was over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a moment\u0027s fear that he was going to discover the knife in her boot when he shackled her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eankles. But he didn\u0027t even roll up her pant leg. He seemed to be doing everything as quickly as possible,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout really paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel heard the shackle snap shut. She kept perfectly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay and listened as he brought Daphne in and chained her. Then she heard voices close by and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esound of other footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put that one down here-what happened to her purse?\" That was Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still in the car.\" Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, bring it in with the other one. I\u0027ll do her feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump of a body hitting a mattress. Footsteps going away. The metallic clink of chains. Then a sigh from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily. Rashel could imagine her straightening up and looking around in satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s it. Ivan\u0027s got number twenty-four in the car. I guess we\u0027re going to have one very happy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joy,\" Quinn said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-four? One client?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave a message that everything\u0027s going to be ready for the big day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re awfully moody, you know. It\u0027s not just me who\u0027s noticed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause, and Rashel imagined Quinn giving one of his black looks. \"I was just thinking it was ironic. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned down a job as a slave trader once. That was before. Do you remember before, Lily? When we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elived in Charlestown and your sister Dove was still alive. A captain from Marblehead asked if I wanted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto ship out to Guinea for some human cargo. Black gold, I think he called it. As I remember, I hit him on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe nose. And Fight-the-Good-fight-for-Faith Johnson reported me for brawling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn, what\u0027s wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just reminiscing about the old days in the sunlight. Of course, you wouldn\u0027t know about that, would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou? You\u0027re lamia; you were born this way. Technically, I suppose, you were born dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And technically, I suppose, you\u0027re going peculiar. My father always said it would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and I wonder what your father would think about all this? His daughter selling humans for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoney. And to such a client, and for such a reason-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, while Rashel was listening desperately, hanging on every word, heavy footsteps\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einterrupted. Ivan had returned. Quinn broke off, and he and Lily remained silent as another body\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethumped on a bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel cursed mentally. What client? What reason? She\u0027d supposed the girls were being sold as regular\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehouse slaves or food supplies. But clearly that wasn\u0027t the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then something happened that drove thoughts of the future right out of her mind. She heard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efootsteps next to her bed, and she was aware of someone leaning close. Not Quinn, the smell was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rough hand grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. Another arm slid under her waist, lifting her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic shot through Rashel, and she tried to push it away. She forced herself to stay limp, eyes shut, arms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edangling passively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ought to have been prepared for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d realized from the beginning that playing her part might include allowing herself to get bitten. To feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire teeth on her throat, to allow them to spill her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it bad never happened to her before, and it took every ounce of her will to keep from fighting. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas scared. Her arched throat felt exposed and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evulnerable, and she could feel a pulse beating in it wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s voice was sharp as the crack of glacier ice. Rashel felt Ivan go still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got something to settle with this girl. She\u0027s a smartass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your hands off her. Before I knock you through the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn-\" Lily said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s voice was painfully distinct. \"Drop her. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan dropped Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" Lily said coolly. \"They\u0027re not for you, Ivan, and they have to be in perfect shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan muttered something sullen and Rashel heard footsteps moving away. She lay and listened to her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheart slowly calming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get some sleep,\" Quinn said, sounding flat and dull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you Tuesday,\" lily said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday, Rashel thought. Great. It\u0027s going to be a very long two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were the most boring two days of her life. She got to know every corner of the small\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eglass-windowed office. The windows were a problem, since she was never absolutely sure if Lily or Ivan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere outside one of them, standing in the warehouse proper and looking through. She listened carefully\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor the warehouse doors, froze instantly at any suspicious sound, and trusted to luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne woke up Monday morning. Rashel had her neck twisted sideways and was staring through the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoffice glass up at the one tiny window set high in the warehouse wall. Just as it turned gray with dawn,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne sat up and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh! It\u0027s all right! You\u0027re here in the warehouse with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rashel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We made it. And I\u0027m glad you\u0027re awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less,\" Rashel said. \"There are two other girls, but they\u0027re both hypnotized. You\u0027ll see when it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egets lighter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne let out her breath. \"Wow... we did it. That\u0027s great. So how come I\u0027m so completely and utterly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eterrified?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re a smart girl,\" Rashel said grimly. \"Just wait until Tuesday when they take us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take us out where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the question.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-10.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
