I love the fuck out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward and kiss her back as I deliver those last few thrusts and then remember that her birth control isn\u0027t working yet. Dammit! I gotta pull out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to do it, but I grab the hand towel and come into it. It\u0027s not nearly as satisfying as coming inside L., but I don\u0027t want her to be upset with me because she wants to avoid a pregnancy for the time being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s giving me the stare. \"I thought we agreed to wait a while before we tried to get pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing there holding the evidence–a towel full of semen–which is the opposite of me trying. \"I pulled out. That doesn\u0027t qualify as me trying to get you pregnant. I would\u0027ve reamed you good when I blew my load if that\u0027s what I was shooting for. Believe me—it would be jam-packed with little swimmers since it\u0027s been a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can still happen even when you pull out, says the girl with the swollen belly.\" Funny one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know and if it does, it just does. By the way, you should know now that I\u0027m not using rubbers on our honeymoon. Forget it. It\u0027s not happening.\" There. She has her warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I have some other stuff, but it\u0027s useless if you don\u0027t give me a chance to put it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time, babe. We won\u0027t be in a rush.\" We\u0027re trying to beat the Margaret alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time, I\u0027ll be your wife.\" Wow. I hadn\u0027t thought of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a pounding at the bedroom door, followed by my mum\u0027s voice. \"I know you\u0027re in there, you little shit, and I\u0027m giving you two minutes to shut it down, get dressed, and get out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe look at each other in the mirror and laugh as we simultaneously say, \"Busted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes and look at the clock. It\u0027s 6:37 on a Saturday morning, and Jack Henry\u0027s spot is already vacant. He\u0027s up earlier than usual on this weekend morning. The thought piques my curiosity, and then the reason for his absence strikes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s our wedding day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the pillow over my face so no one can hear me and I squeal at the top of my lungs. I can\u0027t believe this day is here. Jack Henry will be my husband later today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly change into something more presentable than Jack Henry\u0027s T-shirt and go into the kitchen. I hear someone there and peek around the corner to make sure it isn\u0027t my groom, although I\u0027m certain he knows better than to be in this house with me today. Margaret sees me and laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not in here. He knows I\u0027d beat him within an inch of his life if he set foot in this house today.\" I sit in my usual spot at the bar and can smell Margaret\u0027s freshly brewed cup of coffee. She holds it up. \"Care for a cuppa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know when it happened, but I acquired a taste for coffee somewhere along the way. It was probably while on the road with the band since that was the only thing available for a pick-me-up. \"I\u0027ll take one, although it might not be a good idea to have caffeine on top of my nerves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay to be nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe nerves isn\u0027t the right word.\" Margaret is my mother-in-law now and the closest thing I have to a mom, so I can be honest with her about what I\u0027m feeling. \"I\u0027m hurt because my mom wouldn\u0027t come. She\u0027s still mad because I left her and my career. When she told me she would never visit, I thought she was using it as leverage to make me stay, but I see now that she was serious. If she won\u0027t come for my wedding, then I don\u0027t ever see her visiting, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Laurelyn. I had hoped she would come, but don\u0027t ever think you don\u0027t have people who love you. Your parents will always be your parents, but we\u0027re your family too—not just Jack Henry. We\u0027ll always be here to take care of you because you\u0027re ours now, and we love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the tears coming. \"I know how important family is because I\u0027ve never had one. I\u0027m so happy I\u0027m becoming a member of the McLachlans. I love each and every one of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret blots her eyes with a napkin. \"That\u0027s enough tears on your wedding day. You don\u0027t want your eyes to be red and swollen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the happiest day of my life, and I won\u0027t let my mother\u0027s selfishness spoil it for me. It stops here. \"You\u0027re right. I can\u0027t change the things I have no control over, so no more tears.\" I\u0027ve shed too many of those and I have this wonderful life ahead of me now. From here on out, everything will be different with Jack Henry by my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your groom has a surprise for you. He arranged for all of us to have a morning at the spa. Our appointment is at nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s my Jack Henry—always pampering me like a princess. It\u0027s what he promised me from the night of our first date and he hasn\u0027t disappointed me yet. \"He loves to pamper me. I\u0027m sure I have you to thank for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to teach him and Evan. I hoped they would mature into kind, thoughtful men who treated women with respect, so you can imagine my horror when Jack Henry told me about the arrangement he had with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit! I hoped I\u0027d never have this conversation with her. \"Don\u0027t be upset with him. He didn\u0027t do it by himself. I agreed to everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad it happened the way it did. That time apart showed each of you what you were missing by not being together. It\u0027s probably the best thing that could\u0027ve happened to the two of you. I seriously doubt you\u0027ll ever want to spend a day apart again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of all the days we\u0027ve spent apart, and I know she\u0027s right. \"No. I don\u0027t ever want to be away from him again. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur morning at the spa was so relaxing. I\u0027ll have to remember to give Jack Henry a special thank-you for that tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting on a barstool in the middle of the bathroom floor and Addison is applying my makeup. She\u0027s fantastic at it and could\u0027ve been a makeup artist if she\u0027d wanted to be. She\u0027s working on my blush when a smile comes to my lips. I\u0027m thinking about tonight, and it reminds me of the lingerie I\u0027ve chosen. He\u0027s gonna love it. It\u0027s hot and innocent at the same time—just the way he likes me—and I can\u0027t wait to see his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you grinning like the cat that swallowed the canary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking about tonight.\" Am I that transparent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Do you think it\u0027s going to feel different because he\u0027s my husband? It\u0027s not like we haven\u0027t had sex in almost every possible way imaginable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the wrong one to ask, honey. You should ask Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, Em comes into the bathroom. \"Ask me what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel silly asking someone about wedding-night sex. \"I\u0027m curious about something. It\u0027s no secret that my marital bed will not be a virginal one. Can I expect tonight to feel different with Jack Henry as my husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifts her brows at my question. \"Are you suggesting I wasn\u0027t a virgin when I married Evan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the heat in my cheeks. \"Oh, God. I\u0027m sorry, Em. I didn\u0027t even think of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m kidding, Laurelyn. I had been with Evan every possible way by the time we got married. I think it\u0027s a McLachlan thing,\" she laughs. \"It\u0027s different but obviously not in a physical way. It\u0027s emotionally different—I don\u0027t really have the words to explain it. I think it\u0027s something you have to experience for yourself to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m more nervous about the sex than I am about the wedding. I want tonight to be different and special, but I\u0027m scared it won\u0027t be because we\u0027ve…tasted the nectar so often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what a virginal honeymoon is like so I can\u0027t compare the two, but I don\u0027t think either of you will be disappointed. Don\u0027t let it worry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret appears in the doorway and lightly raps against the open door. \"May I disturb you for a moment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to say anything this morning until I was a hundred percent positive, but I have a surprise for you.\" She\u0027s beaming as she steps aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Margaret stand my mom and dad. And Nana and Pops too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m out of my seat and in my mom\u0027s arms instantly. As much as she\u0027s done wrong, I forget it all in that moment because she\u0027s my mother and I\u0027ll always love her. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re here. Thank you for coming.\" I look at my dad and grandparents. \"And you too. I\u0027m shocked. I wasn\u0027t expecting this at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Margaret called me last week. She said some things that made me come to my senses, and realize there was no way I could miss being here for you. I\u0027d hate myself if I chose to miss my only child\u0027s wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mouth \"thank you\" to Margaret over my mom\u0027s shoulder and spend a few minutes catching up with my family before Addison boots them out so we can finish my hair and makeup. When she\u0027s done, there\u0027s no doubt in my mind that I\u0027ve never looked better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addison, you are amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It helps when you begin with a beautiful canvas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the finishing touch,\" she says as she secures the champagne floral piece to the back of my hair. It\u0027s tucked and pinned into a perfectly romantic updo, just above my neckline. \"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t go with some goofy-looking veil hanging down to your feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t matter if it was a church or vineyard wedding—that so wasn\u0027t happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a mirror so I can see what the back of my hair looks like with the floral embellishment. \"What you chose is perfect. Are you ready to get into your dress? The photographer is waiting and you don\u0027t want to be in a rush to finish your bridal portraits before the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As ready as I\u0027ll ever be.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-48.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
