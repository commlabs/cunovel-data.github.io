My brother\u0027s a very strong man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll keep you safe until your brother returns. I give you my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, silent minute passed before she showed any reaction to that promise. Caine thought she might\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe too overcome with gratitude to speak. Then she moved away from him and looked up into his eyes. He realized she wasn\u0027t overcome at all. Hell, she looked downright irritated. \"You\u0027ve already broken\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour word to me, sir. You promised you\u0027d kill me and then changed your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is different,\" he argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really mean what you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I mean what I say,\" he answered. \"You just explained that you\u0027ll be safe once your brother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereturns in two weeks. It is two weeks, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression was solemn. \"Perhaps even sooner. But you\u0027re a pirate. You cannot be taking such chances keeping me safe for two long weeks. There\u0027s a bounty on your head. I won\u0027t be responsible\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor getting you killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have much faith in my ability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any faith in your ability,\" she qualified. \"Why should I? You\u0027ve just admitted that the rumors about you aren\u0027t at all reliable. You probably don\u0027t even leave a white rose on your victim\u0027s pillow, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was exasperated with her again. \"You don\u0027t have to sound so damned disappointed in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am disappointed!\" she cried out. \"You aren\u0027t even honorable. That\u0027s the real pity. Besides, you don\u0027t look at all strong enough to take on my enemies. You\u0027d be an easy target, Caine. You\u0027re such a ... big man. No, I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m afraid you simply won\u0027t do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to throttle her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her back on him again and tried to leave. Caine was so astonished by her attitude he almost let her get away. Almost. He caught her just as she reached the walkway outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hold wouldn\u0027t allow her any freedom as his arm was anchored around her shoulders. He tucked her into his side with as much care as he\u0027d give an old blanket, then turned to speak to Monk. \"I don\u0027t want you telling anyone what happened here tonight. Give me your word, Monk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should he give you his word when you so freely break yours? A gentleman only asks as much as he can give in return, sir. Didn\u0027t your mama teach you any manners?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Jade,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the rub.\" He looked down at her and slowly stroked the side of her cheek with his fingertips. \"I\u0027m not a gentleman. I\u0027m a pirate, remember? There\u0027s a distinct difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went completely still the second he touched her. Caine thought she looked quite stunned. He didn\u0027t know what to make of that odd reaction. When his hand dropped away, she came out of her stupor and shoved against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there is a difference,\" she muttered. \"Tell me this, Caine. If I make you angry enough, will you kill me in vexation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The idea\u0027s beginning to have merit,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me. You must never touch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mustn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t like to be touched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how in God\u0027s name was I suppose to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obviously hadn\u0027t realized he was jesting. \"You were going to use a pistol,\" she told him. She paused to give him a suspicious look. \"You do own one, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" he answered. \"And where was I suppose to . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One clean shot, directly through my heart,\" she explained. \"You\u0027d have to be accurate, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t want to linger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he agreed. \"Lingering would definitely be out of the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you find this amusing? We happen to be discussing my death!\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not amused,\" he argued. \"Fact is, I\u0027m getting downright angry again. Tell me, do I get to ravage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath before answering. \"You certainly do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a pity,\" he replied, completely ignoring her outraged expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, do your parents happen to be first cousins? You\u0027re acting like a complete simpleton. You\u0027re either\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean idiot or the most cold-hearted man I\u0027ve ever met. I find your conduct disgraceful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were flashing with indignation. Caine had never seen such a dramatic shade of green before. It was as though the purity and the sparkle of a thousand emeralds had all been squeezed dry of their color and given to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not at all convinced you\u0027re in any real danger, Jade,\" he announced. \"This could very well just be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea product of your overactive imagination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dislike you intensely,\" she whispered. \"And as for your ignorant opinions, well I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, save the bluster for later. I\u0027m not in the mood. Now, I don\u0027t want to hear another word about killing you. And if you continue to glare up at me so prettily, I swear I\u0027m going to kiss you just to take your mind off your foolish worries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiss me?\" She looked stunned. \"Why in God\u0027s name would you want to kiss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t the faintest idea,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d kiss someone you disliked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I would,\" he replied with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are arrogant, overbearing ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sputtering, my sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have a quick comeback. Caine continued to stare down at her when he spoke to Monk again. \"Well, Monk, do you give me your word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. I won\u0027t be telling anyone about this night, Caine, but we both know your friend, Lyon, will surely find out before the sun sets again. He\u0027ll wring the truth out of me. I\u0027m giving you warning ahead of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. The Marquess of Lyonwood was a good friend. Caine trusted him completely. The two had worked on several missions together for their government. \"Yes, he will find out,\" he predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But his new wife and son keep him occupied. Besides, when he learns what I\u0027m up to, he\u0027ll keep it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto himself. If he inquires, you may speak freely to him. No one else though, not even Rhone,\" Caine added, referring to Lyon\u0027s closest friend. \"For all his merits, Rhone does talk too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk nodded. \"I\u0027m begging you, Caine, to let me know how it all ends up with the little lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monk?\" Jade asked, drawing both men\u0027s attention. \"You wouldn\u0027t happen to own a pistol, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded too damned eager to him. Caine knew what she was thinking. His angel was as easy to read as a Latin text. \"He doesn\u0027t and he won\u0027t,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t and I won\u0027t what?\" Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t own a pistol and you won\u0027t kill her,\" Caine answered in a clipped tone of voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, of course not,\" Monk agreed. \"Caine, you aren\u0027t forgetting your trap, are you?\" he asked, when he was finally able to pull his gaze away from the beautiful woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not forgetting,\" Caine answered. He turned to Jade and asked, \"Is your carriage returning for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer exasperation was obvious. \"I hired a hack,\" she told him. \"I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be returning to my lodgings tonight.\" She pushed away from his hold and picked up the large gray satchel from the walkway. \u0027\u0027All I own is in here. I came directly from the country,\" she added, almost as an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left your possessions on the street for anyone to snatch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my intention to have my things stolen,\" she answered. She sounded like a tutor instructing a deliberately obtuse student. \"I was hoping my clothing could benefit some poor soul. I wasn\u0027t supposed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto have further need once you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" he nearly growled. \"You aren\u0027t going to mention murder again. Have you got that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer him quickly enough. Caine tugged on her hair. She let out a shrill cry just as he noticed the large swelling above her ear. \"Good God, Jade, when did you get that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch it,\" she demanded when he tried to prod the edges of the bump. \"It still stings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would think so,\" he said. His hand dropped back to his side. \"Tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I caught the heel of my boot on the carpet loop in my brother\u0027s house and tumbled down the stairs,\" she explained. \"I hit the side of my head on the banister knob. It fairly knocked the wind out of my sails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind out of her sails? Caine thought that was a rather odd remark to make, but he didn\u0027t take time to reflect upon it. \"You could have killed yourself,\" he stated. \"Are you always so awkward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m never awkward,\" she countered. \"I\u0027m usually very ladylike. Lord, you\u0027re rude,\" she ended with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened after you fell?\" Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I went for a walk to try to clear my head. Then they started in chasing after me, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course?\" Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They?\" Caine said at the very same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused to give both men a frown. \"The men I saw kill the finely dressed gentleman,\" she explained. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, do pay attention. I\u0027m certain I mentioned that fact earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk shook his head. \"I\u0027m just as certain you didn\u0027t, miss,\" he confessed. \"I\u0027m sure I would have remembered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You witnessed a murder? No, Jade, you sure as hell didn\u0027t mention that fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I meant to mention it,\" she muttered. She folded her arms across her chest and looked disgruntled again. \"I would have explained it all to you if you hadn\u0027t turned my attention by arguing with me. So you see, this is your fault because I lost my train of thought. Yes, you\u0027re to blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you witness the murder before or after you hit yourself in the head?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you suppose it was a titled gentleman she saw murdered?\" Monk asked Caine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not hit myself,\" Jade snapped. \"And it was before ... no, it was after. At least I think it was after\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell down. Oh, I don\u0027t remember now. My head\u0027s pounding again. Do quit your questions, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine turned back to the tavernkeeper. \"Now I\u0027m beginning to understand,\" he said. He looked at Jade again. \"Were you wearing your cloak at the time of this mishap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. She looked perplexed. \"But what does that.. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tore your cloak and bruised your face when you fell down, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone was a little too condescending for her liking. \"Tell me exactly what it is you think you\u0027re beginning to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really very simple,\" he answered. \"Your head suffered a trauma, Jade. You aren\u0027t thinking logically now, though I must admit that most women aren\u0027t ever logical. Still, with plenty of rest and care, in a few days you\u0027ll realize your mind was just playing tricks on you. You\u0027ll be worrying about what gown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto wear to your next ball then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mind isn\u0027t playing tricks on me,\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re confused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not confused!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit shouting,\" Caine ordered. \"If you\u0027ll only think about what I\u0027m . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave up when she shook her head at him. \"You\u0027re too addled to be reasoned with now. We\u0027ll wait until you\u0027re feeling better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right, miss,\" Monk whispered. \"If you\u0027d seen a titled gentleman murdered, the news would have hit this section of town right off. The men who\u0027d done the deed would have boasted of their cunning. Listen to Caine now. He knows what\u0027s best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you believe I\u0027m just imagining I\u0027m in danger, then you don\u0027t need to protect me, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, I do,\" he replied. \"Only now I know who I\u0027m protecting you against.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could ask another question, he continued. \"Like it or not, you\u0027re a menace until you\u0027ve recovered. In all good conscience, I can\u0027t leave you on your own.\" His smile was gentle when he added, \"I guess you could say I\u0027m protecting you from yourself, Jade. Now give me your satchel. I\u0027ll carry it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to lift the bag before Caine could and ended up in a tug of war. Caine won. \"What in God\u0027s name do you have in here?\" he asked. \"This thing weighs more than you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything I own,\" she answered. \"If it\u0027s too much for you, I\u0027ll be happy to carry it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine shook his head. He took hold of her hand. \"Come along. My carriage is waiting two blocks over. You should be home in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew to an abrupt stop. \"Whose bed, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sigh was loud enough to wake the drunks littering the alleys. \"Your very own bed,\" he snapped. \"Your virtue\u0027s safe. I never take virgins to my bed and I sure as certain don\u0027t want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she would be relieved by his vehement promise not to bother her. It was only a half lie, of course. He did want to kiss her, yet he wasn\u0027t sure if it was merely out of the need to have a few minutes of blissful silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a little rule of yours?\" she asked. \"Not to bed a virgin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked highly insulted. Caine didn\u0027t know what to make of that reaction. \"It is,\" he answered. \"I also don\u0027t bed daft women I don\u0027t particularly like, sweet, so you\u0027re safe enough with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dared to grin at her when he made those shameful remarks. \"I do believe I\u0027m beginning to hate you,\" she muttered. \"Well, you\u0027re bloody safe with me, too, Caine. I would never let you touch me, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, good,\" she replied, determined to have the last word. \"If you don\u0027t quit dragging me, I\u0027m going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto scream your name over and over again until the authorities come and take you away, Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost fell down. Caine grabbed her. \"I said, I\u0027m not Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just who in thunder are you then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d reached his carriage but she refused to let him assist her inside until he\u0027d answered her question. She kept slapping his hands away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine gave in. He tossed her satchel up to the driver, then turned back to her. \"My name really is Caine.

When we\u0027re on our way, I\u0027ll explain everything to you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-3.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
