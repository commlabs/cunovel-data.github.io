There is something hauntingly familiar about Brenna, something that compels him to travel into the past, save the beautiful witch from the stake, and bring her safely to his own time. Now, in the modern world, it is Brenna\u0027s seductive innocence and sense of wonder that are utterly bewitching the once-weary vampire, blinding him to a growing danger.
