Like most of the shoe stores on this avenue, it had a liberal stock of boots exposed outside, at prices low enough to attract the attention of those passing. Within it was narrow, but deep. There was a counter on one side, with two or three sofas in the open space for the accommodation of customers who wished to try on shoes. Behind the counter were two shopmen, while one outside was fitting a boy with boots.

The young man had drawn him on till he believed that Sam was practically found. Now, discovery seemed as remote as ever. Again he emerged into the street. There was a shoe store on the next block. His hope revived. He entered that also, but the faces were all unfamiliar. He asked as before, but succeeded in eliciting no information. He kept on his way for a mile, entering store after store, marveling inwardly why there should be need of so many shoe stores, and, as he failed to discover Sam, almost beginning to doubt whether he hadn’t made a mistake about the street. He began to feel lonely, not for the lack of human faces, for he had met hundreds of persons, but the peculiar loneliness of a stranger in a great city, who, among the multitudes that he meets, recognizes not one familiar face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3004/82900.html","bookId":297,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:46:12 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:46:12 AM"}
