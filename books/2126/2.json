He looked savagely triumphant at having gotten Gabriel to lose control. Kaitlyn realized he wasn\u0027t thinking anymore, just feeling. He was lost in his hurt and betrayal and anger, lashing out in a way she\u0027d never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, we\u0027ve changed, she thought, sick with dismay. We\u0027ve all changed from being in such close contact with one another. Rob used to be so pure and now he\u0027s furious . . . just like a regular human being, her mind added, unasked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027s wrong-and I\u0027ve got to stop this. Before the two of them actually kill each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Rob was saying. \"D\u0027you have the guts to go one on one with me? No hocus-pocus, just our fists. You man enough for that, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel pulled off his jacket, despite the efforts of Anna and Lewis to keep him still. Strapped to his forearm was a knife in some kind of spring-loaded mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, great, Kaitlyn thought. She held on to the crystal shard more tightly. She knew she should get it to safety-but where was safety? Gabriel could follow anywhere she went; could take the knowledge of where it was hidden out of her mind. And besides, she couldn\u0027t leave and let Gabriel and Rob fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to gamble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the crystal, Gabriel,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve got it-and the only way you\u0027re going to get it is the way you did before.\" But I\u0027m hoping you won\u0027t, she added mentally. You said yourself that it\u0027s not going to do us any good. We can\u0027t get to Mr. Z\u0027s crystal-so what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifference does it make? Why not just go back and tell him you couldn\u0027t find it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trying to give him a way out. If he didn\u0027t really want to hurt them . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel hesitated. His mouth was tight; his eyes hard. But she could see uncertainty in his face. He stood very still a moment, then, abruptly, he started toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s mind blanked out in fear and surprise. Behind her, the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, are you guys still up-?\" The sleepy voice broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Tony, Marisol\u0027s brother, wearing cutoff shorts as pajama bottoms. He was rubbing his eyes and frowning. Clearly whatever Gabriel had done to keep the Diaz family asleep had worn off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?\" Tony demanded, staring at Gabriel. Then he blinked and the frown disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s you. I remember you from last time. Come back to get the brujo, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed happier to see Gabriel than he had been to see the rest of them, Kait thought. Maybe because Gabriel was somebody he could relate to-another tough guy. Or maybe because he thought that of all of them, Gabriel was most likely to be able to get Mr. Zetes. Tony hated Mr. Z with a passion; called him \"El Diablo\" or \"El Gato\"-both names for the devil, and longed for him to be sent abajo-down below to hell-where he belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five who shared the web were all frozen by the presence of a stranger, like figures in a tableau. Tony went on talking cheerfully; he didn\u0027t seem to feel the tension in the room or see the blood on Rob\u0027s chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you got the cuchillo-the magic knife for Marisol. I couldn\u0027t believe it when they told me. A real old-fashioned charm, right? After all those doctors said she\u0027d never wake up-we\u0027ll show \u0027em!\" He grinned, his usually sullen features almost glowing. He did everything but slap Gabriel on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn looked at Gabriel sharply, saw what she\u0027d suspected-that he hadn\u0027t known the shard could cure Marisol. Maybe she should have told him, but she hadn\u0027t liked the idea of giving Mr. Z any further information. He\u0027d find a way of using it against them somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, though, it had given Gabriel pause. He seemed thrown off balance by Tony\u0027s gratitude and good humor. Embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Gabriel certainly helped us to get the shard,\" Kait said-and that was true enough. If Gabriel hadn\u0027t defected, the Fellowship\u0027s crystal wouldn\u0027t have been reduced to shards in the first place. \"And he would want Marisol to get well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob was quietly wiping his bloody mouth again. He\u0027d backed off when Tony came in, and Kaitlyn could feel through the web that he was calming down. Gabriel looked at him, then at Kaitlyn, and finally at Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have a big party when all this is over,\" Tony said. \"A real blowout. I\u0027ve got some friends in a garage band. As soon as Marisol is better.\" He ran a hand through his curly mahogany hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn pressed the crystal to her chest and looked at Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her gaze a minute with eyes as dark and unfathomable as storm clouds. For the first time that night she consciously noticed the scar on his forehead-a crescent-shaped mark left by his encounter with Mr. Z\u0027s crystal. Right now it seemed to stand out against the pale skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, looking suddenly tired, Gabriel shrugged. His eyelids drooped, hooding those depthless eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stay,\" Tony offered immediately. \"There\u0027s plenty of room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t. But I\u0027ll be back.\" He said the last to Kaitlyn and Rob, with heavy emphasis. Kait couldn\u0027t mistake his meaning. \"I\u0027ll be back-soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his jacket and walked out the door. Kaitlyn felt her breath come out in a rush. She found she was holding the crystal so hard it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony yawned. \"So, are you guys coming to bed? I put sleeping bags on the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give us a minute,\" Rob said. \"We have to talk something over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony left. Rob shut the door after him, then turned to face the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe isn\u0027t as calm as I thought, Kaitlyn realized. Rob\u0027s jaw was set, his skin pale under its tan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Rob said. \"What to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn shifted. \"He did go away,\" she pointed out. \"Without the crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob angled a sharp glance at her. \"Are you defending him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Because it doesn\u0027t matter if he went away. He\u0027ll be back. You heard him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna opened her mouth, then shut it and sighed. She put a hand to her forehead. Her usual serenity was in tatters, but she seemed to be regaining it, gathering it around her like a cloak. \"Rob\u0027s right, Kaitlyn,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said slowly. \"Gabriel did say that-and he meant it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn lowered her arms and looked at the crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was heavy and cold, and on one facet was a pinkish smear. Gabriel\u0027s blood. \"But what can we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I want to know.\" Lewis\u0027s round, open face was tense. \"What can we do against him? He knows where we are-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to get out,\" Rob said. \"That\u0027s obvious. And another thing that\u0027s obvious-Gabriel\u0027s our enemy now. I meant it when I said we\u0027d fight him. We\u0027ve got to do whatever\u0027s necessary from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn felt very cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis was sober. \"Geez,\" he breathed. Then he said, \"I guess if we have to stop him, we will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just that. If we have to hunt him, we will, too. We may have to destroy Mr. Zetes-and that may include Gabriel. If it does, it does. We\u0027ll do whatever it takes,\" Rob said. \"We don\u0027t have any choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis looked even less happy, but he nodded slowly, scratching his nose. Frightened, Kaitlyn turned to Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna\u0027s lovely face was set. \"I agree,\" she said quietly. \"Although I hope he\u0027ll come to his senses and it won\u0027t be necessary-for now he\u0027s our enemy. We have to treat him that way.\" Her dark eyes were sad but stern. Kaitlyn understood-Anna\u0027s nature was peaceful, but she had the pragmatism of Nature itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes hard choices had to be made, sometimes even sacrifices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all in agreement, all united against Gabriel. And they were looking at Kaitlyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Kaitlyn realized what she had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to her in a dazzling burst of inspiration, almost like one of her pictures. A crazy plan, completely insane-but she had to do something. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t let Rob destroy Gabriel-not only for Gabriel\u0027s sake, but for Rob\u0027s. If he succeeded, he would be changed forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first item in her plan was not to let anyone know she was planning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she composed her face and did her best to veil her thoughts. It wasn\u0027t easy to hide things from mind-mates, but she\u0027d gotten a lot of practice in the past week or so. Looking as resigned and grim as possible, she said, \"I agree, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was worried that they might be suspicious- but she was with three of the most unsuspicious people in the world. Rob nodded, looking genuinely grim and resigned himself, Anna shook her head sadly, and Lewis sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll hope for the best,\" Rob said. \"Meanwhile, I guess we should get some sleep. We\u0027ll have to get up early and get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich means I don\u0027t have much time, Kaitlyn thought, and then she tried to smoke-veil that, too. \"It\u0027s a good idea,\" she said, going over to the desk and putting the crystal shard back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis said good night and left, chewing one thumbnail and looking wistful. About Gabriel? Kaitlyn wondered. Or Lydia? Anna departed for the bathroom and Kait and Rob were left alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about all this,\" Rob said. \"And especially sorry he hurt you. That was-unspeakable.\" His eyes were dark, dark gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" Kaitlyn was still cold-and drawn to Rob\u0027s warmth like a moth to a flame. Especially now, when there might be no tomorrow . . . but he couldn\u0027t know that. She reached for him and he took her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir first kiss was a little desperate, on both sides. Then Rob calmed down, and his tranquility spread to Kait. Oh, nice. Warm tingles, warm golden haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was harder now to cloak her thoughts from him. But she had to, he couldn\u0027t suspect that they were going to be separated for the first time since they\u0027d met. Kaitlyn clung to him and concentrated on thinking about how much she loved him. How she wanted to engrave him on her memory . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kait, are you all right?\" he whispered. He held her face between his hands, searching her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I just-want to be close.\" She couldn\u0027t get close enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve changed me, she thought. Not just showing me that boys aren\u0027t all pond scum. You\u0027ve made me different, made me look at the broader picture. Given me vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Rob, I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Kait,\" he whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that meant it was time to stop. She was losing her control; he was reading her thoughts. Reluctantly Kaitlyn pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it yourself. We\u0027re going to need our sleep,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, grimacing. Then nodded, yielding. \"See you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep well, Rob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re so good, Rob, she thought as the door closed behind him. And so protective of me. You wouldn\u0027t let me do it. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a map of Oakland on the desk; they\u0027d bought it to find their way back to Marisol\u0027s house. She put it in her duffel bag with the rest of her worldly possessions-a change of clothes bought with the Fellowship\u0027s money and her art kit-and pulled a pair of underwear over it. Maybe there was a way to leave the bag in the bathroom . . . yes, and she could wear a nightgown over her clothing. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need something?\" Anna\u0027s voice said from behind her. Guilt stricken, Kaitlyn froze in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlank your mind! Kaitlyn told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been caught red-handed, thinking about things that would make Anna suspicious-if Anna had been listening. And everything tonight depended on Anna not suspecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just trying to figure out what to wear tomorrow,\" Kait said lightly, giving the bag a final rummage-through. \"Not that I have much choice; I\u0027m beginning to feel like Thoreau.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With his one old suit?\" Anna laughed, and Kaitlyn felt the knot in her stomach ease. \"Well, I\u0027m sure Marisol would lend you something if she knew what an emergency it was. Why don\u0027t you look in the closet?\" Anna was going to the closet herself as she spoke. \"Whew! This girl liked clothes. I bet we can both find something to fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, Kaitlyn thought, as Anna pulled out a long slim cotton-knit dress and said, \"This looks like you, Kait.\" I love you and Lewis almost as much as I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo Rob. You\u0027re all so decent-and that\u0027s why he\u0027s going to beat you if you\u0027re not careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced her mind away from that and looked around the room. Marisol\u0027s room was like Marisol herself-an unpredictable mixture. Neat with messy, old with new. Like the big mahogany desk, with its silky-ruddy finish scratched and stained, as if it had been given by a loving grandmother to a careless teenager who used it for mixing perfume and storing a CD player. Or the leather miniskirt peeping out of a hamper just below the picture of the Virgin Mary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of expensive sunglasses were lying half under the bed\u0027s dust ruffle. Kait picked them up and absently twisted one gold earpiece back into shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about this?\" Anna was saying, and Kait whistled. It was a very sexy, very feminine dress: spandex bodice fitting to just below the hips then flaring to a sheer chiffon skirt. Tiny gold clasps held the cap sleeves. A radical dress, black, that would make the wearer look slim as a statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you?\" Kait said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you, dummy. It would make the boys swallow their tongues.\" Anna started to put the dress back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to think of it, you don\u0027t need any more boy trouble. You\u0027ve got two panting after you already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This kind of dress might get a girl out of trouble,\" Kait said hastily, taking the hanger. Spandex and chiffon wouldn\u0027t wrinkle, and she would need all the weapons she could gather if her plan went through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn outfit like this might make Gabriel sit up and take notice, and seducing Gabriel was item number one on her date book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded the dress small and put it in her duffel bag. Anna chuckled, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this really me doing this? Kait wondered. Kaitlyn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrady Fairchild, who used to think Levi\u0027s jeans were high fashion? But if she was going to be Mata Hari, she might as well do it thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she said was, \"Anna? Do you think about boys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\" Anna was peering into the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you seem so wise about them. You always seem to know what they\u0027ll do. But you don\u0027t seem to go after them,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna laughed. \"Well, we\u0027ve been pretty busy lately with other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn looked at her curiously. \"Have you ever had one you really liked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the barest instant of hesitation before Anna answered. She was looking at another dress, fingering some sequins that were coming off. Then smiled and shrugged. \"Yeah, I guess I found somebody worth caring for once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-not much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn, still watching curiously, realized with surprise that Anna\u0027s thoughts were veiled. It was like seeing lights behind a paper wall-she could sense color but not shape. Is that what my veiling looks like? she wondered, and barely had the wits to ask, \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-it would never have worked out. He was together with somebody already. My best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Thoughts of veiling had led to thoughts of what she was veiling, and Kaitlyn was by now utterly distracted. She hardly knew what she was saying, much less what Anna was. \"You should have gone for it. I\u0027ll bet you could have taken him. With your looks ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna grinned ruefully and shook her head. \"I would never do that. It would be wrong.\" She put the sequinned dress back in the closet. \"Now, bed,\" she said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um.\" Kaitlyn was still distracted. Thinking: I\u0027m casual, I\u0027m calm, I\u0027m confident. She hurried to the bathroom and came back with her clothes still on under the billowing flannel nightgown she\u0027d gotten at Anna\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d acquired it on the trip up to Canada, because they hadn\u0027t stopped by Anna\u0027s home in Puget Sound on the way back down. They\u0027d accepted money and a 1956 Chevy Bel Air from the Fellowship and taken Route 101 all the way down the coast, driving all day for three days, avoiding Anna\u0027s parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvoiding any parents-they hadn\u0027t contacted Lewis\u0027s in San Francisco or Rob\u0027s in North Carolina or Kaitlyn\u0027s father in Ohio. They\u0027d agreed on this early as a necessity; parents would only get worried and angry and would never, never agree to their kids doing what had to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from what Gabriel had said, Anna\u0027s parents had gone to the police anyway. They\u0027d had proof of what Mr. Z was up to-files Rob had stolen from the Institute, detailing Mr. Z\u0027s experiments with his first group of students . . . but obviously even proof wasn\u0027t enough. Mr. Z had the police sewn up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one from the outside could take him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn sighed and pulled the covers more tightly over herself. She was focused on Anna, lying beside her in Marisol\u0027s bed; listening to Anna\u0027s breathing, monitoring Anna\u0027s presence in the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was certain Anna was asleep, she quietly slipped out from under the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going out to see Rob, she projected, not loud enough to wake the other girl, but loud enough, she hoped, to wiggle into Anna\u0027s subconscious. That way, if Anna noticed her missing in the next few hours, she might assume Kaitlyn was in the living room and not worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait tiptoed to the bathroom, where she\u0027d managed to leave her duffel bag. She stripped off the flannel nightgown and crammed it on top of the black dress and Marisol\u0027s designer sunglasses. Then she crept down the hallway and noiselessly let herself out the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no moon, but the stars were frosty-pale in the night sky. Oakland was too big a city for them to make much of a show, and for a moment Kaitlyn felt a pang of homesickness. Out by Piqua Road in Thoroughfare, the sky would be pitch-black, huge, and serene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time to think about that. Keep moving and find a phone booth, girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in Thoroughfare, she would have been terrified of walking around a strange city at night-not to mention daunted by the task of trying to get to another strange city, at least thirty or forty miles away. But she was a different Kaitlyn than she\u0027d been back in Thoroughfare. She\u0027d dealt with things then that Kaitlyn had never dreamed of, she\u0027d traveled all the way to Canada without any adult to help, and she\u0027d learned to rely on her own resources. Now she had no choice. She couldn\u0027t wait until morning-she\u0027d never get away from the others in the daytime. She didn\u0027t have money for a cab. Still, there must be a way to get across the bay to San Carlos; she just had to find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an almost frightening coolheadedness, she set out to find the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t a bad area of town, and she found a phone booth with an undamaged phone book. She looked up Public Transportation in the local area pages-thank heaven, it said that most of the buses ran twenty-four hours a day. She could even see the basic route she\u0027d have to take: up to San Francisco to get across the water, then south down to San Carlos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, how to find a bus that was running at this hour? Well, first thing was to find the bus line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWincing a little, she tore the AC Transit map out of the phone book-a rotten thing to do, but this was an emergency. Using that and the map of Oakland she navigated her way to MacArthur Street, where the map showed the \"N\" bus running all night. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-visions-the-passion-dark-visions-3/page-2.html","bookId":2126,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:28 PM"}
