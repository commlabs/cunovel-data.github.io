I lose the small amount of ice cream and the pizza we had earlier. I gag, trying to be quiet. I leave my shoes and my shirt. I hug the bin and run for the bathroom. I close the door and sink against it. The weight of him and the feel of his skin, it was magical but it came with a flash of something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was someone else in our embrace. They were there. I was watching him through a tiny crack in the floor. He was holding someone, kissing them. The crack in the floor is big enough I can see the bad things in the dirty house. I can\u0027t close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind closes off before anything else comes up. I get sick again, mostly in my mind. There is nothing left inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else happened to you Emalyn?\" He is beside the door. His voice is soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear I don’t. My mind won\u0027t let me remember.\" With the door between us I feel the best I ever have about our relationship. I love having him there but not able to touch me. All of the things I\u0027m thinking come to a conclusion. \"I can\u0027t see you anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em. Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow and wipe my face, gripping the small garbage can. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m never going to grow past here. This is it. I\u0027m always going to want to be where we are. Never moving beyond this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can wait. We\u0027ve only been at this a short amount of time.\" His voice is desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s cruel to ask you to hold out.\" Tears fill my eyes, they try to make the kaleidoscopes but I blink them back. I don’t deserve a different view of things. \"I\u0027m never going to change.\" I stand and dump the pail in the toilet. I rinse it out with hand soap and dry it with a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em, don’t do this. You\u0027re doing so well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentence stings coming from him. It shows me the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like that I\u0027m broken. You want to be my hero and my knight. You want me to need you to keep me safe.\" I mutter. I pray he didn’t hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at myself in the mirror. I see her still. The dead girl who never made it out of the scary house alive. I see her. I\u0027ll always see her. She is me. I am not the girl who lived and found food on the streets. I\u0027ll never be that girl. I\u0027m the dead girl who didn’t make it out. I\u0027ve been living for us both, but I need to start seeing things for what they are. She is one of the only memories I have of the dirty house. She is the only one I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dead fish eyes stare back at me. I splash water on my face and let it come in and take over. I\u0027m not afraid when I open the door. The look of terror and fear that was on my face, has traumatized him. I know he won\u0027t touch me again. Even if I beg him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks hurt and beaten down. I walk past him. I feel for my cell in my pocket and pick up my runners. I don’t hunt down my shirt. I would rather be nearly naked, and just in my bra, than collect my things and see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just wants to see you. Just once.\" Her eyes are shiny and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Why? So I can look at him like he\u0027s a rapist again? So I can throw up when he touches me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slumps on the bed, \"Can\u0027t you just be his friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow down my bile, \"No. I can\u0027t. He makes me think things. He makes me want things. But I\u0027m not strong enough to have them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezes my hand, \"Em, you are. We made it this far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"I know. I\u0027m happy about this far Shell. I like it here. I want to finish school and have a normal life. I\u0027m cool with my normal being what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"No. I don’t believe it.\" She gets up and leaves the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a knock on the door after she is gone for a minute. I see her keys on the bedside table and moan. I climb off the bed and open the door. I can\u0027t breathe when I see him. He steps in and closes the door. His hands reach for mine. His skin burns me. His eyes are desperate and wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"W-what are y-you d-doing here?\" I am almost frozen in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps back and presses his back against the door, letting go of me. I step back, making a large gap between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like that word need. I like that he needs me. I\u0027m a selfish bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to say goodbye in person. I never got to say the things I wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart aches instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Em. It\u0027s silly and fast and too much for what I get in return. But I do. You\u0027ve got me on the run, chasing you all the time. You have all the cards and I don’t even care. I\u0027d chase you around the world.\" His voice drops off at the end and becomes a forced whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hazel eyes are shiny and complicated. \"I\u0027ve thought about nothing but you for the last couple months. And even if I see that you\u0027re right, I can\u0027t seem to make myself let go of you. Even though I refuse to see it all, the look in your eyes says all the things you won\u0027t. I know, in my heart, you won\u0027t ever heal. You won\u0027t ever get past this. I can’t force myself to give up on you. So I am leaving. It\u0027s about the only thing I can do. I need to sleep and not see your face every time I close my eyes. I hate that you think I want you broken and injured so you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, he heard me say it. I wanted so many things from him and the acceptance that I\u0027m a hopeless freak was never one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t force this between us and I can\u0027t live with the look you give me, that makes me feel like some kind of monster. I\u0027m leaving the school. You don’t have to worry about the gym or anything. It\u0027s all yours again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps forward and kisses my forehead. His breath is soft devastating warmth on my face. He turns and leaves. He chooses survival over me. It\u0027s no different than what I have done. We are both just trying so hard to survive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and collapse on the bed. I have schoolwork to do, but I curl in a ball and turn on the TV. I turn on Amelie and wish I were Audrey Tautou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hi.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drag my fingers over the top of it, \u0027He left me. He left me broken. More broken than I already was.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you need the doc?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffle and heave, \u0027Not yet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do you need?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To be normal. I would die to be normal.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t die. Give Dr. Bradley a chance.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Next week.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave it at that and curl into the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeeks pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t run anymore. I don’t need to. The running was for self-preservation. There is nothing left inside of me to save. I study like mad and watch Netflix. I increase the number of movies I\u0027ve seen by hundreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just before Christmas break when Stuart is driving me to the Doctor\u0027s office. I had avoided Dr. Bradley when I was seeing Sebastian. I didn’t want her telling me how poor of a decision it was to bring another victim into my mess. I didn’t want to see the truth of it all in her eyes. The truth that no matter how hard he tried, I would screw it all up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch Stuart\u0027s eyes in the rearview, they aren’t watching Shell, they\u0027re watching me. Shell nudges me, \"We\u0027ll be right outside, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"K.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates. I answer, \"Hi.\" I always sound impatient with him now. He annoys me by existing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to remind her that you\u0027re still not sleeping okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and shoot Shell a look, \"How do you know that? Maybe I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs bitterly, \"I know you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I ask softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do as you\u0027re told.\" He isn’t laughing anymore. He\u0027s annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince, \"K.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"That is a letter. It’s not a word. Can\u0027t you just speak like you have something of an education?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing fine in school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. Nice work on the grades by the way. I have to admit the straight A\u0027s surprised me. Between the whatever\u0027s and the k\u0027s, I figured you were doomed.\" His voice lightens. I don’t know what the game is we\u0027re playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" I say sarcastically. I don’t even know how he knows I got all A\u0027s. I was so relieved to get good grades, with all the drama and heartbreak. It\u0027s one good thing about OCD, good grades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs again, \"Call me when she\u0027s done. I want to talk to you about something important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang up the phone and glare at Shell, \"you told him I wasn’t sleeping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I\u0027ve still never spoken to Uncle Daddy Weirdo. Not even kidding. I don’t know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes find Stuart\u0027s in the mirror. He makes a face, \"I don’t know about your sleeping patterns. Jeeze. I don’t even talk to him. You\u0027re the only one who has ever heard his voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilt my head in disbelief, \"You\u0027ve never met him or talked to him? Ever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Never. Not even kidding. Dude found me at my boxing ring. My trainer came up after a fight and asked if I was interested in a job. Said that the guy watched the fight and needed someone to drive for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"You took a job based on that little information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts, \"I get paid a hundred grand a year to drive your ass around. Hell yes, I took the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach drops, \"Who would pay that kind of money?\" My brain whispers, \u0027not good people.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell giggles, \"And my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stare leaves me and becomes deadly sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell raises her eyebrows, \"That’s not all you\u0027re doing to my ass though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimace, \"Gross. Focus people. Jesus. So he hired you from a boxing ring? He clearly wanted someone who can handle them self. When did he hire you? I thought you were a ninja?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"UFC. It\u0027s kickboxing. Same thing as being a ninja. He hired me the beginning of the summer. He told me you would pick the city and that I would live there. I was pumped when you chose Boston.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-12.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
