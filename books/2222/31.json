She gestured for her niece to join us at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk St. Ana was now wearing a navy blue one-piece swimsuit under blue shorts; red letters with a white border spelled USA across her chest. She was carrying a gold and maroon equipment bag with UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA GOLDEN GOPHERS Stamped On it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you met Mr. McKenzie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not formally,” Silk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered my hand. She squeezed it just enough to be polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My niece, Silk,” Cilia said by way of introduction. “She’s going to be an Olympic diving champion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aunt Cil,” Silk said between gritted teeth. “She’s always bragging to people about that,” she told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to be an Olympic diving champion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then it’s not bragging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. McKenzie is a private detective,” Cilia added. It wasn’t true, but I didn’t correct her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? That is so cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It sounds more exciting than it is,” I said without actually knowing if it was or wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. McKenzie is helping our investment firm on a land acquisition project.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? I thought maybe he was involved in my mother’s murder case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilia sighed heavily, slumping in her chair. “I was lying,” she admitted. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk gripped Cilia’s shoulder reassuringly. “My aunt still thinks I’m four years old,” Silk told me. “She still thinks I need to be protected from the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who and what my mother is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who and what is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A selfish drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk looked into my eyes when she spoke, deliberately trying to make me feel as uncomfortable as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you last see your mother?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Eons ago. I doubt she would even recognize me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t so much as blink when she said that, but Cilia sure did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you’re wrong,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you awfully young to be an Olympic diving champion?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, no. The Chinese girl who won gold in ‘92 was thirteen. She won again in ‘96 and 2000.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long have you been diving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I started when I was four years old—on the same day I came to live with my aunt. She had a swimming pool, and I couldn’t get enough of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This one?” I gestured at the pool in the center of the patio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We were living in Andover up in Anoka County back then. Actually, I think it’s hereditary. I inherited my love of swimming from my aunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk was standing directly behind Cilia now, her hands resting on the older woman’s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She set a state high school record for women in the breaststroke that stood for six years,” Silk said. “How long ago was that, Aunt Cil?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind how long ago that was. Don’t you have practice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to work off the ten-meter diving platform at the university aquatic center. Coach is going to videotape me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that helping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk nodded. “Helps with visualization. I’m getting much better control of my take-offs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My niece, the Olympian.” Cilia smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk smiled right back. “If I keep progressing, if I don’t get hurt, if I do well at the nationals . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you say, Aunt Cilia. May I take the Mazda?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You always do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because I look so good in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk pecked her aunt’s cheek, said, “See ya,” then added, “It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved away from the table, hesitated, and turned back, her smile fading. “How much trouble is my mother in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure,” I said. “The fact she hasn’t been charged yet is a good sign. It means the county attorney’s case isn’t even strong enough to take before a grand jury.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilia reached up from her chair and stroked the girl’s bare arm. “It’ll be all right,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl nodded another good-bye and moved across the patio toward the French doors. “Oh, by the way,” she called over her shoulder. “I won’t be home for dinner. I’m meeting Mark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait a minute.” Cilia was on her feet now. “Excuse me,” she said before crossing the patio. Both her face and her voice were stern while she spoke to her niece. I pretended not to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s Mark?” Cilia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A junior at the University of St. Thomas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Diver?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“JO major. Remember when I did that exhibition last spring, the school newspaper ran a story about me? He wrote it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“College junior. That makes him what, twenty, twenty-one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sixteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I look twenty.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-31.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
