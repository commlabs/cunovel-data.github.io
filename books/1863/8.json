She couldn\u0027t afford to be hurt or scared-or stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was too much riding on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd since Morgead had the advantages of telepathy and strength on her at the moment, she was going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto have to come up with some clever way to beat him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took a moment to come up with a plan. And then Jez was carrying it out, every ounce of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econcentration focused on tricking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped backing up and took a step sideways, deliberately putting herself in a position where she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould make only a clumsy block. Then she gave him an opening, holding her stick awkwardly, its tip\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoward him but drooping too far down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see-it\u0027s my elbow, she thought to him, knowing he couldn\u0027t hear her, but willing him to take the bait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy elbow hurts too much; I\u0027m distracted; the stick is no longer an extension of me. My right side is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunprotected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was as good at it as any mother bird who pretends to have a broken wing to lure a predator away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom her nest. And she could see the flash of triumph in Morgead\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it; don\u0027t waste time injuring me anymore ... come in for the kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was doing it. He\u0027d stopped trying to get her into a corner. With his handsome face intent, his eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enarrowed in concentration, he was maneuvering for a single decisive strike; a takedown to end the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecombat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he raised his fighting stick to make it, Jez pulled her own stick back as if she were afraid to block,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafraid of the jarring contact. This was the moment. If he caught on now, if he realized why she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epositioning her stick this way, he\u0027d never make the move she wanted him to. He\u0027d go back to disarming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too hurt to block properly; my arm\u0027s too weak to raise, she thought, letting her shoulders droop and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher body sway tiredly. It wasn\u0027t hard to pretend. The pain in various parts of her body was real enough,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand if she let herself feel it, it was very nearly disabling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead fell for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made the strike she wanted; straight down. At that instant Jez slid her leading foot back, shifting just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout of range. His stick whistled by her nose-missing. And then, before he could raise it again, while he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas unguarded, Jez lunged. She put all the power of her body behind it, all her strength, slipping in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetween Morgead\u0027s arms and driving the stick to his midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air in his lungs exploded out in a harsh gasp and he doubled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez didn\u0027t hesitate. She had to finish him instantly, because in a second he would be fully recovered. By\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe time he was completely bent over she was already whipping her stick out and around to strike him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind the knee. Again, she put her whole weight behind the blow, following through to scoop him onto\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead landed with a thud. Before he could move, Jez snap-kicked hard, catching his wrist and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknocking his stick away. It clattered across the floor, oak on oak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she held the pointed end of her own stick to his throat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yield or die,\" she said breathlessly, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead glared up at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was even more breathless than she was, but there was nothing like surrender in those green eyes. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tricked me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All\u0027s fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just looked at her balefully from under the disordered hair that fell across his forehead. He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esprawled flat, long legs stretched out, arms flung to either side, with the tip of the snakewood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efighting stick resting snugly in the pale hollow of his throat. He was completely at her mercy-or at least\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat was how it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez knew him better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that he never gave up, and that when he wasn\u0027t too mad to think, he was as smart as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as sneaky. Right now the helpless act was about as sincere as her wounded bird routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she was ready when he threw another blast of Power at her. She saw his pupils dilate like a cat\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout to pounce, and she braced herself, shifting the stick minutely to push into his collarbone as she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy smashed into her. She could almost see it now, with the sixth sense that was part of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire heritage. It was like the downrush of a nuclear cloud, the part that went flowing along the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eground, destroying everything in its path, spreading in a circle from the point of impact. It seemed to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efaintly green, the color of Morgead\u0027s eyes. And it packed quite a punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez gritted her teeth and hung on to the fighting stick, keeping it in place, letting the Power wash through\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. It blew her hair back to stream in a hot wind and it seemed to last forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut finally it was over, and she was tingling with pain, with a metallic feeling in her teeth. And Morgead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas still trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hissed at her, an amazingly reptilian sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got anything else?\" Jez said, grinning down at him with narrowed eyes. Every bruise on her body hurt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafresh in the aftermath of the blast-but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t going to let him see that. \"No? I didn\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s upper lip lifted. \"Drop dead, Jezebel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody was allowed to use her full name. \"You first, Morgy,\" she suggested, and leaned harder on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green eyes were beautifully luminous now, with sheer anger and hatred. \"So kill me,\" he said nastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgead-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way you\u0027re going to win. Otherwise I\u0027m just going to lie here and wait to recharge. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen I\u0027ve got enough Power I\u0027ll hit you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never know when it\u0027s over, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s never over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez bit down on a rush of fury and exasperation. \u0027I didn\u0027t want to have to do this,\" she snarled, \"but I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t kill him. Instead, she hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed his wrist and locked it, with her hand holding his and her stick on top of his wrist. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould use leverage here to cause severe pain- or to break the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give up, Morgead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bite me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to break your wrist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tine. I hope you enjoy it.\" He kept glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a little kid threatening to play on the freeway, Jez thought, and suddenly, inexplicably she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealmost overcome by laughter. She choked it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to break his wrist. But she knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe had to. And she had to do it soon, before he regenerated enough Power to hit her again. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t take another of those blasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgead, give!\" She put enough pressure on his wrist that it really hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her the evil eye through dark lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so stubborn!\" Jez put on more pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell it was hurting him. It was hurting her to keep the steady pressure up. Shooting stars of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epain were zinging in her elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez\u0027s heart was beating hard and her muscles were beginning to tremble with fatigue. This was much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore difficult for both of them than a clean break would have been. And he was a vampire- his wrist\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould heal in a few days. She wouldn\u0027t be injuring him permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to do it, she told herself. She tensed her muscles-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Morgead took a little quick breath, an indrawn hiss of pain. For just an instant his green eyes lost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir gemlike clarity, unfocusing a bit as he winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez let go of his wrist and collapsed to sit beside him, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are so stupid, her mind told her. She shook her hair out and shut her eyes, trying to deal with the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Morgead sat up. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know!\" Jez snarled without opening her eyes. Being weak and idiotic, she answered herself. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t even know why she couldn\u0027t go through with it. She killed vampires-and less obnoxious ones than\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead-all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t yield,\" Morgead said. His voice was flat and dangerous. \"So it\u0027s not over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tine, blast me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTm going to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, you like it so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez snapped. She grabbed her stick off the ground and turned to look at him for the first time since she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esat down. \"Yeah, I love it, Morgead! I\u0027m crazy about pain! So do it, and then I\u0027m going to hit you over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour thick head so hard you won\u0027t wake up until next week!\" She might have said more, but the look in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her intently, not simply belligerently as she\u0027d imagined. His green eyes were narrow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just crazy period,\" he said, sitting back, his gaze still probing. In a different tone he said softly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why didn\u0027t you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez lifted her shoulders and dropped them. There was a pit of anger and misery in her stomach. \u0027I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuppose because then I\u0027d have to break every bone in your body, you jerk. You\u0027d never give up, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith that new power you\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could teach it to you. The others aren\u0027t strong enough to learn it, but you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat forced a short laugh out of Jez. \"Yeah, right.\" She shut her eyes briefly, wondering what Morgead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould say if she were to tell him why she could never learn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d squash me like a bug, she thought, and laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You laugh weird, Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a twisted sense of humor.\" She looked at him, blinking wetness out of her lashes. Where had that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome from? There must be something in her eye. \"So. Want to start this fight again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her hand gripping the snakewood stick. Jez tried to keep that hand steady, but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould feel the fine tremors in the muscles. She took a deep breath and clenched her teeth, making her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egaze challenging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can fight again. I can do it because I have to, and this time I won\u0027t let any stupid sympathy get in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway of beating him. I have to win. Everything depends on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead looked back at her face. \"No,\" he said abruptly. \"We don\u0027t have to do it again. I yield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez bunked in shock. It was the last thing she\u0027d expected. Morgead\u0027s expression was cold and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez got mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she blazed at him. \"Because I\u0027m tired? Because you don\u0027t think I can take you?\" She whipped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe stick up, ready to split his stupid skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re crazy!\" Morgead yelled. \"And because-\" He stopped dead, looked furious. Then he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid curtly, \"Because you won fair the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly she lowered the stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s expression was still distinctly unfriendly. But he\u0027d just made an almost unbelievable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadmission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just don\u0027t want me to whop you anymore,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a sideways look that would kill pigeons in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez let out her breath. Her heart was just beginning to settle down and relief was spreading through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did it I really did it. I\u0027m not going to die today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s over,\" she said. \"I\u0027m back in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re leader,\" Morgead said sourly. \"Enjoy it, because I\u0027m going to be right behind you every step,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust waiting for my chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t expect anything else,\" Jez said. Then she blinked. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" His face set, his eyes on the far wall, Morgead was tugging his shirt away from his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneck, and leaning his head back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea-\" Then Jez realized. She went cold to the tips of her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think. I should have remembered, but I didn\u0027t, and I didn\u0027t plan for this....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood in, blood out,\" Morgead said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn\u0027t I remember? Panic was stirring inside Jez. She couldn\u0027t see any way to get out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor human gangs \"blood in, blood out\" meant you got beat up when you were jumped in, and you didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleave until you were dead. But for vampire gangs...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t bite him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most frightening thing was that something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einside her wanted to do it. Her entire skin was tingling, and it suddenly seemed as if it was only yesterday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat she\u0027d had her last blood meal. She could remember exactly how it felt, sinking her teeth into smooth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eskin, piercing it easily, feeling the warm flow start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Morgead\u0027s blood would be dark and sweet and powerful. Vampire blood wasn\u0027t life-sustaining like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman blood, but it was rich with the hidden promise of the Night World. And Morgead was one of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrongest vampires she\u0027d ever met. His blood would be full of the mastery of that new attack, full of raw,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evital young energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0027t drink blood. I\u0027m not a vampire! Not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was trembling in shock. In the entire year since she\u0027d stopped drinking blood, she\u0027d never been so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etempted. She had no idea why it had come on like this now, but it was almost out of her control. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epressed her tongue against one sharpening canine, trying to restrain it, trying to get some relief from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estress. Her upper and lower jaws were aching fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t. It\u0027s unthinkable. If I do it once, I\u0027ll never be able to stop. I\u0027ll become-what I was back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be lost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t-but I have to. I need to get back in the gang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was staring at her. \"Now what\u0027s wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I. . .\" Jez was dizzy with fear and longing and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe sense of danger. She couldn\u0027t see any way out....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" she said, unbuttoning the collar of her shirt. \"You bite me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It satisfies the requirement. Blood has to be spilled. And it\u0027s the leader who does it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re the leader, idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until I\u0027m back in the gang. And I\u0027m not back in the gang until blood is spilled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her, his eyes hard and demanding and not amused at all. \"Jez... that\u0027s ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too smart. She didn\u0027t dare let him keep thinking about it. \"Because I think it\u0027s the proper\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprocedure. And because-I overfed last night. I don\u0027t want anymore.\" She stared straight into his eyes, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eallowing a muscle to quiver. Trying to force her version of the truth into his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead blinked and looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez allowed herself to relax minutely. She had one advantage over Morgead; there was no way he could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven imagine her real motives. She just hoped he wouldn\u0027t discern the human flavor to her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you won\u0027t tell me, I give up.\" He shrugged. \"So, fine. If that\u0027s the way you want it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\" He turned back to her and reached for her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new shock rocked Jez. Morgead never hesitated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonce he made up his mind, but this was a little unnerving. His grip was a bit too firm and authoritative;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how am I going to shield myself? she thought wildly, clamping down on a new wave of fear. He\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealready a powerful telepath and sharing blood increases rapport How am I supposed to block that-?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was happening too fast; she didn\u0027t have time to plan or think. All she could do was try not to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epanic as Morgead drew her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerk... he\u0027s had too much experience at this, part of her thought furiously. At subduing any kind of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprey. At gentling scared girls-human girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding her lightly and precisely; he was tilting her chin back. Jez shut her eyes and tried to blank\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she could feel the warmth of his face near her skin; she could feel his breath on her throat. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew his canine teeth were extending, lengthening, thinning to needle points. She tried to control her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a swathe of warmth as he licked her throat once, and then a pain that made her own teeth ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth had pierced her skin, sharp as obsidian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the release of blood flowing. Her life, spilling out The instinctive twinge of fear Jez felt had nothing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto do with him invading her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo vampire liked to make this kind of submission. Letting someone drink your blood meant you were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweaker, it meant you were willingly making\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyourself prey. Everything inside Jez protested at just relaxing and letting Morgead do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe that was the answer, she thought suddenly. A wall of turmoil to cover her thoughts. Pretend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be too agitated to let him make contact. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his lips were surprisingly soft on her throat, and the pain was gone, and he was holding her more like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea lover than like a predator. She could feel his mind all around her, strong, demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t trying to hurt her. He was trying to make it not-terrible for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I want it to be terrible. I don\u0027t want to feel like this....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter. She felt as if she were being pulled by a swift current, dragged and tumbled into some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplace she had never been before. Sparkling lights danced behind her closed eyelids. Electricity crackled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she felt his mouth moving gently on her throat, and the world fell away.... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-8.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
