I should have eaten strawberries or melon or a dozen roses or an entire mint plant. Did that work for women? I read an article that it worked for men. Their spunk tasted like what they ate. Did my vagina taste like spaghetti right now? God dammit! I shouldn\u0027t have eaten dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands glided back up my legs to the tops of my thighs until his thumbs slid through the lips of my sex. He stopped kissing the area all around my triangle of curls, pulled his head up a little and watched what he was doing with his fingers. I had one eye open at this point so I could see what his next move was. Even though I was freaking out about the fact that my vagina might taste like Chef Boyardee, it was kind of hot to watch Carter stare at me as his hands rested on my thighs and he slid his thumbs up and down through my wetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thumbs slid up one last time, spreading me open as he went. He groaned, and before I could apologize for not letting my lady parts gargle with mouthwash, he dipped his head and wrapped his lips and tongue around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strangled cry flew from my mouth as I arched my back and smacked my hand down on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll embarrassment was forgotten when his mouth made contact with me. Every thought flew out of my mind and all I could do was feel what he was doing to me. He licked and sucked me into his mouth, letting his lips and tongue slide down to my opening and back up. He flattened his tongue and lapped over top of my clit, up and down, over and over again. The roughness of his tongue and his warm breath hitting my wet skin made me gasp and start moving my hips with the rhythm of his tongue. He moved his lips away, using just the firm tip of his tongue to flick back and forth against the most sensitive spot at a feverish pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could already feel the tingles of my orgasm lurking just beyond my reach. I could hear the sounds of his lips and tongue on me and I didn\u0027t even give a shit right now how much those sounds echoed around the quiet room. Carter was going to make me have an orgasm with his mouth and just thinking that in my head made every inch of me throb and my hips thrust faster against him. His tongue slid down my slit and pushed its way inside me. My legs started to shake with the need for release and I could hear myself panting with need. He pushed his tongue in and out of me slowly, over and over, before sucking his way back up. He kissed my clit like he kissed my mouth all those times before - soft lips, swirling tongue, sucking skin. One of his hands moved away from my thigh and I felt the tip of his finger swirling against my opening. Around and around his finger teased while his mouth continued to devour me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the haze of pleasure I heard myself chanting \"yes, yes\" over and over, encouraging him to push his finger inside. His lips and his tongue never stopped their ministrations against me while he complied with my wishes. His long finger slowly glided into me until he was so deep I could feel his knuckles pressed against my skin. With boldness I never knew I possessed, I grabbed onto the back of his head and held him against me, my hips thrusting erratically while his finger began moving in and out of me. He moved his head from side to side so that his mouth glided back and forth over me while he continued pushing and pulling his finger out of me. Before I knew it, my orgasm was rushing through me. I clutched his hair with my fists and held him in place while I bucked my hips and shouted in pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God! Ohhhhhh YES!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter continued to lick every drop while I panted and whimpered through my release and slowly came down from the high. If I didn\u0027t pull him away, he would probably never stop. But I needed him now. I let go of my death grip on his hair, yanked on his arms and tugged him up my body. He crawled up the length of me, hovered over top of my body and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You taste so f**king good. I could do that all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, Carterâ€™s dirty talk surprisingly turned me on. I\u0027m pretty sure I let out a growl as I slid my hand down between our bodies and wrapped it around his hardness that rested against my inner thigh. I channeled my dirty slut and pumped my hand up and down his smooth, hard length. I rubbed my thumb back and forth over the wetness that leaked out of the tip, spreading it all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck, shit I need to be inside you,\" Carter mumbled incoherently. He quickly slid his hands all around the top of the bed next to us and blindly reached for one of the condoms. When his hand finally made purchase, he stood up on his knees between my legs and I watched him take the condom out of the wrapper, place it on the tip of his penis and slide it down. I never really thought something like that would be hot, but son of a bitch! Watching him touch himself, even if it was just to put on a condom was f**k-awesome. As soon as he was sheathed, I reached back down between us and wrapped my hand around his length, needing to touch him. He leaned down over top of my body, wrapping his arm around my waist so he could pull me against him and slide us up to the middle of the bed. I slung my free arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer so I could position him right at my opening. I bent my knees so that his body was cradled in between my legs. He pushed his hips forward just enough that the swollen head slipped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo different from our first time and yet, the same. His body still fit against mine like it was made to be there. His skin against mine still made my entire body tingle with anticipation. I moved my hand off of him and wrapped it around his back, clutching on to him tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked into my eyes and I blurted out, \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a shuddering breath, \"So much,\" he whispered in reply. \"I will never, ever regret our first time, but I would give anything if it would have gone a little more like this.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-71.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
