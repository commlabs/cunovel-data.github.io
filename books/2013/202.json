No, we’re not happy, Adjunct. Not happy at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeak didn’t know much about any of this. In fact, he would be the first to admit he didn’t know much about anything at all, except maybe weaving sorcery. The one thing he knew for certain, however, was that no-one liked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting tied to the belt of this scary captain woman would probably turn out to be a bad idea. She reminded him of his mother, looks-wise, which should have killed quick any thoughts of the lustful kind. Should have, but didn’t, which he found a little disturbing if he thought about it, which he didn’t. Much. Unlike his mother, anyway, she wasn’t the type to browbeat him at every turn, and that was refreshing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was born a stupid boy to very rich noble-born parents.’ Usually the first words he uttered to everyone he met. The next ones were: That’s why I became a soldier, so’s I could be with my own kind.’ Conversations usually died away shortly after that, which made Beak sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have liked to talk with the other squad mages, but even there it seemed he couldn’t quite get across his deep-in-the-bone love of magic. ‘Mystery,’ he’d say, nodding and nodding, ‘mystery, right? And poetry. That’s sorcery. Mystery and poetry, which is what my mother used to say to my brother when she crawled into his bed on the nights Father was somewhere else. “We’re living in mystery and poetry, my dear one,” she’d say-I’d pretend I was asleep, since once I sat up and she beat me real bad. Normally she never did that, with her fists I mean. Most of my tutors did that, so she wouldn’t have to. But Isat up and that made her mad. The House healer said I almost died that night, and that’s how I learned about poetry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wonder that was sorcery was his greatest love, maybe his only one, so far, though he was sure he’d meet his perfect mate one day. A pretty woman as stupid as he was. In any case, the other mages usually just stared at him while he babbled on, which was what he did when getting nervous. On and on. Sometimes a mage would just up and hug him, then walk away. Once, a wizard he was talking to just started crying. That had frightened Beak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain’s interview of the mages in the platoon had ended with him, second in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where are you from, Beak, to have you so convinced you’re stupid?’..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t sure what that question meant, but he did try to answer. ‘I was born in the great city of Quon on Quon Tali in the Malazan Empire, which is an empire ruled by a little Empress and is the most civilized place in the world. All my tutors called me stupid and they should know. Nobody didn’t agree with them, either.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So who taught you about magic?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We had a Seti witch in charge of the stables. In the country estate. She said that for me sorcery was the lone candle in the darkness. The lone candle in the darkness. She said my brain had put out all the other candles, so this one would shine brighter and brighter. So she showed me magic, first the Seti way, which she knew best. But later, she always found other servants, other people who knew the other kinds. Warrens. That’s what they’re called. Different coloured candles for each and every one of them. Grey for Mockra, green for Ruse, white for Hood, yellow for Thyr, blue for-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You know how to use Mockra?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. Want me to show you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not now. I need you to come with me-I am detaching you from your squad, Beak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right.*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You and I, we are going to travel together, away from everyone else. We’re going to ride from unit to unit, as best we can.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ride, on horses?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you know how?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Quon horses are the finest horses in the world. We bred them. It was almost another candle in my head. But the witch said it was different, since I’d been born into it and riding was in my bones like writing in black ink.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you think you’ll be able to find the other squads, even when they’re using sorcery to hide themselves?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Find them? Of course. I smell magic. My candle flickers, then leans this way and whatever way the magic’s coming from.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right, Beak, you are now attached to Captain Faradan Sort. I’ve chosen you, over all the others.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Grab your gear and follow me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How close?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Like you were tied to my sword-belt, Beak. Oh, and how old are you, by the way?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-202.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
