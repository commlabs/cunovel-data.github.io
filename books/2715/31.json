Then he nodded and gave a very serious murmur. “Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unexpected thrill raced through me. He’d been worried about me. I loved that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearing my throat, I glanced away. “My aunt’s a child psychologist,” I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and kept watching me but didn’t respond, so I felt compelled to talk more. “I adore her. She’s just...she’s so awesome. And she’s never tried to psychoanalyze me, or whatever, but there have been things she’s said here and there over the years that’s always made me feel better. It’s just like she...gets my predicament, or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your predicament?” he started, only for his gaze to clear with understanding. “Oh, you mean the misfit thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face heated as I glanced away, uncomfortable with this track. “Yeah. I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Knox only nodded, no censure or judgment in his gaze. “I take it she’s not a snob like the rest of the Bainbridge clan.” When I sent him a scowl, he shrugged. “What? You still haven’t convinced me to like anyone else in your family, except maybe Aunt...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cynthia,” I provided. “Except she’s not a Bainbridge. She’s my mom’s older sister on the Worthington side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy shit,” he squawked, his mouth falling open. “Your mom’s a Worthington? And your dad’s a Bainbridge. Jesus, I don’t stand a chance, do I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat flooded my belly. I didn’t mean to ask, but my mouth formed the words, anyway. “Stand a chance at what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze, looking caught, before glancing away and muttering, “Measuring up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the air inside me vacated my lungs in a rush. I was so bamboozled by his answer I just gaped at him for a good minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, seriously...what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he in any way feel the need to measure up to me? He was the super-hot, super-sweet, super-amazing older boy who took my breath away with a mere glance. I was the one who felt all insignificant, inexperienced, and...cheesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was this flicker of uncertainty in his eyes as he checked on Bentley, swallowing so hard the muscles in his throat seemed to trip over a bundle of nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeding him to know immediately that he had nothing whatsoever to worry about in that department, I cleared my bone-dry throat. “I think the worth of a person comes more from who you are and less from what you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnox glanced at me. His brown eyes were hooded and dark before he shook his head. “Yeah,” he said, smiling softly. “You’ll do just fine as a child psychologist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was never anything so impossible as trying to pee when someone stepped into the bathroom stall next to yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI probably should’ve waited until I got home to do this instead of dashing into the store’s bathroom for immediate answers as soon as I made my purchase. But then I remembered, oh right, going home currently wasn’t an option. Damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my lip, I closed my eyes and tipped my face toward the ceiling. Come on. Come on. Niagara Falls. Atlantic Ocean. Rushing streams. Water parks and flooding canals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePee already!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady next door finished her business and flushed. As the pipes drained, I finally felt a trickle. I rushed to aim the stick under me, hoping I was hitting my target. But this was even more challenging than pissing in a cup at the doctor’s office. Inability to aim pee sucked ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I resented men even more than I had ten seconds ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky bastards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky cheating bastards who could aim their pee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside my stall, the other woman began to wash her hands. After I finished and flushed, I pulled up my pants and then waited, sitting, refusing to even look down at the test in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease be negative, please be negative, I silently begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no idea what I’d do if the result came out with a plus sign on the stick, I hesitantly lowered my face and looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” I wheezed, as the door to the ladies’ room came open again, admitting a new full-bladdered woman. “Oh, thank you, God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stumbled out of my stall seconds later—possibly looking a might crazy-eyed—the woman was still frozen just inside the doorway, her eyes wide with her purse clutched close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blasted her with a smile I couldn’t stop. “Hi! Beautiful day, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I laughed—one of those maniacal, uncontrollable laughs—because up until now, it’d been a pretty shitty, miserable day for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman blinked and then darted into a stall, probably to escape the insane woman she was trapped in a public bathroom with. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-31.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
