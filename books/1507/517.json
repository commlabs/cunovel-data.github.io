His eyes glowed with a profound light. Everything around him was bright red. The lake of blood below began to boil and rise up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that were all there was to it, the true fearsomeness of the blood tattoo would not have been made manifest. However, all of the cultivators in the area suddenly felt that the blood inside their bodies was suddenly out of control, as if it were about to burst out from within them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bandit Tribe members felt this way, as did the Cultivators atop Blackgate Fort!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was instantly shocked by this development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything dimmed; up above, winds blew and clouds roiled. A fountain of blood could be seen in mid-air within the neo-demon horde, focused on Meng Hao’s index finger!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, in the Southern Domain, some distance from the border of the Black Lands….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bloody glow rose up into the sky from the Ancient Temple of Doom. This glow instantly caused the great Sects and Clans of the Southern Domain to stir into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the deity statues within the Ancient Temple of Doom began to weep tears of blood. It was a bizarre sight which shook the entire Southern Domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost seemed that these statues were commemorating the power of the Blood Immortal as it returned into the world!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, back in the great lands of the Western Desert, outside Blackgate Fort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao slowly looked up at the shocked peak experts of the bandit alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the Ji Clan Blood Clone, I can congeal a blood totem. It can’t compare to the violet rain, so I don’t want it to be permanent. However, to temporarily reach the full circle of the five elements will do nicely. Or perhaps… I can use the blood totem as the foundation and fuse it with the violet rain. Then I can reach the great circle of the Water-type totem!” Eyes filled with anticipation, Meng Hao lifted his hand up and pressed his index finger onto his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five elements…. temporarily combine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power birthed of the spirit of the Golden Crow! Metal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boundless life force of the Greenwood Tree! Wood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Frost soil which gave birth to the Frost Soil Demon Emperor! Earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Everburning Flame! Fire!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, the legacy power of the Blood Immortal, transformed into blood. Water!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this instant, the five elements reached their great circle. I might only be a temporary great circle, but it caused Meng Hao’s Cultivation base to soar up nonetheless. His Perfect Gold Core emanated with limitless golden light. A transformation began during which it seemed… a Nascent Soul became visible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the five elements began to combine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetal. Wood. Water. Earth. Fire. Five elements fused together, both promoting and restraining each other as they united to form a primeval Chaotic will. Within this primeval Chaos appeared a single strand of light!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis light was golden in color, the same gold as the metal of the five elements, and the same color as the Metal-type totem tattoo. It also was the same color as Meng Hao’s Perfect Gold Core. As soon as the golden light appeared, Meng Hao’s Cultivation base roared up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt climbed up ceaselessly. In the blink of an eye… he broke out from the Gold Core stage and into the early Nascent Soul stage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Perfect Gold Core began to melt, from within which emerged a Nascent Soul that belonged uniquely to Meng Hao!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of now, Meng Hao could slay the early Nascent Soul stage, shock the mid Nascent Soul stage, and hold his own against the late Nascent Soul stage. It was hard to say if he would be able to come out victorious against the latter. In any case, this was a power that the Core Formation stage simply could not possess. The power of Meng Hao’s Five-Colored Nascent Soul had been completed one step at a time as the various totem tattoos appeared. As of now, he possessed a battle prowess that was completely unprecedented and thoroughly frightening in the Cultivation world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, in the view of the Divine Sense of outsiders, Meng Hao actually appeared to be of the great circle of Core Formation. However, no one could deny that he was of the Nascent Soul stage. Many people actually assumed that Meng Hao was deliberately putting on a front to make it look as if he was of the Core Formation stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently… in the moment that Meng Hao’s Cultivation base exploded upward, causing him to enter the early Nascent Soul Sage, a Nascent Soul was formed within his Gold Core. The faces of all the Cultivators who were watching instantly filled with disbelief, and they gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He… had a Cultivation base breakthrough? He’s in the Nascent Soul stage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How… how is this possible? He reached the Nascent Soul stage? Don’t tell me that before, he really was just a Core Formation Cultivator!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s impossible! Perhaps he was already a Nascent Soul Cultivator before, but because of some unforeseen circumstances, experienced a Cultivation base drop, and only now is faintly able to recover?” Astonished conversations spread out on the battlefield as well as among the audience up on the battlement of Blackgate Fort, and even among the groups of bandit Tribe peak experts who were trying to fight their way through the neo-demon horde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as they were locked the throes of astonishment, a second beam of light rose up from Meng Hao, in addition to the golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlickering green light interlocked with the golden light. Meng Hao’s hair whipped about as boundless life force suddenly began to emanate out from him. In this moment, his Cultivation base soared even higher. As of now… he was at the peak of the early Nascent Soul stage, only a step away from the mid Nascent Soul stage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sudden explosion instantly shook the minds of everyone who was watching. Even as Meng Hao lifted up his head and roared, three colors appeared behind him, a three-colored sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGold, green, plus the color which represented his Water-type blood totem, red!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three colors of the sky that appeared behind Meng Hao were reflected in the firmament up above as Meng Hao’s Cultivation base once again leaped higher. It climbed up ceaselessly, breaking through from the early Nascent Soul stage to the mid Nascent Soul stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment the faces of each and every person observing were filled with disbelief. Duo Lan’s eyes were wide, as if she was seeing something unimaginable. Even Zhang Wenzu’s eyes were flickering with deeper and deeper concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, a fourth, world-shaking color suddenly appeared. Yellow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Meng Hao, a four-colored sky could be seen. His Cultivation base did not stop climbing, but rather, continued to rocket up. It was as if all the methodical preparations he had made were now being unleashed with explosive results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis energy exploded out and his aura grew vastly more intrepid as behind him, five beams of light interlocked to form a Five-Colored Sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat fifth color was… black!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive elements, five colors. In this moment, they transformed into a Five-Colored Sky that circulated around Meng Hao. His clothes rippled, and his hair was in chaos. His eyes glowed with a bizarre, brilliant light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao floated there, his body emanating radiant five-colored light, a Five-Colored Sky behind him. As of this moment, there were no totem tattoos visible on his body. All he possessed… was the Five-Colored Sky and an indescribably fearsome aura!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese five colors stemmed from Meng Hao’s five elements. Gold came from the Metal-type tattoo. Green came from the Wood-type. The Water-type blood made red. The soil of Frost was black!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally came fire. It was not red, but yellow, a raging flame that rose up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Cultivation base rocketed up a final time. His aura exploded out with incredible intensity, profoundly affecting all the Cultivators who were watching. Deep in their hearts, it caused all onlookers to feel fear and trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he reached the peak of the mid Nascent Soul stage. His distance from the late Nascent Soul stage was… only a sliver. At last, the rocketing climb of his Cultivation base came to a stop. Everyone on the battlefield was shaken as they looked at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis explosive Cultivation base growth came after years of suppressing his Gold Core. In this instant, he experienced meteoric growth into the peak of the mid Nascent Soul stage as he unleashed all that had been pent up before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, he could battle with the late Nascent Soul stage. As of now… Meng Hao was powerful enough that, although he might not be able to shake the Spirit Severing stage, he could crush any Cultivator under that stage like dry weeds or rotten wood. He would be able to cut through any of them like a hot knife cutting through butter!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all that, Meng Hao let out a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I can understand this violet rain, then I could merge it into the blood totem and create a great circle Water-type totem. When that happens, my Cultivation base will definitely be able to break through from the mid Nascent Soul Stage!” Meng Hao knew that his current Cultivation base was not truly of the great circle of the five elements and thus, could not propel him past the mid Nascent Soul stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not what he truly wanted. The water of these five elements contained part of the blood of the Blood Immortal. What he wanted was the violet rain of the Western Desert Apocalypse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was his choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, his five elements Cultivation base was only a temporary fusion. In fact, his Nascent Soul was actually illusory, and the five elements were not fully combined. He had not concocted his Five-Colored Nascent Soul. Once he did, then his Cultivation base would be completely stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a bizarre light shone in his eyes. He looked off into the distance at the countless neo-demons and the astonished experts and totemic Sacred Ancients of the bandit tribes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s time to test out the battle prowess of this temporary combination of the five elements!” Even as he murmured to himself, the neo-demons roared and pounced onto the bandit Tribe experts, forcing them to defend themselves. Suddenly, one of the Nascent Soul experts was separated from the others by the neo-demons. A wide-open space was then cleared, an empty lane providing a clear line of sight from him to Meng Hao, who was a few hundred meters away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man and Meng Hao looked at each other for a moment, and then Meng Hao coolly said, “Bring it on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such arrogance and conceit!!” roared the old man, who happened to be a High Priest. His eyes flickered coldly as he used minor teleportation to shoot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the members of his Tribe, including the Elders and the Greatfather, had been killed because of the Exotic Heartdevil Flower. As of now, he was the only peak level expert left from his Tribe. He shot forward, his eyes flickering with intense killing intent. As he neared, his totem magically appeared above his head. It was an immense star which then transformed into a gigantic boulder three thousand meters wide. Rumbling sounded out as it shot through the air toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao hovered there, his expression tranquil. He waved his right hand, causing the Five-Colored Sky to flicker. A swooshing sound could be heard as a five-colored light expanded out and then disappeared. A moment later, the incoming boulder shook and then disintegrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of this caused everyone watching to be shocked, especially the charging High Priest. His face filled with disbelief. It was at this point that Meng Hao distractedly waved his hand and pointed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he pointed, the Five-Colored Sky rippled and then disappeared. When it reappeared, it had congealed onto Meng Hao’s finger. Then his finger descended, and blinding five-colored light shot toward the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a High Priest, but his face flickered nonetheless. He roared as he unleashed divine abilities and magical items. He shot backward, using several minor teleportations to suddenly disappear and then reappear off in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reacted quickly and moved with incredible speed. It seemed as if no matter how swift and fierce the five-colored beam of light was, it wouldn’t be able to touch him. However… suddenly he found that his entire body was trembling. He coughed up a mouthful of blood as a five-colored glow appeared on his chest. He stared down in disbelief, unable to do anything except gape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you can see,” said Meng Hao softly, his eyes shining with enlightenment, “you cannot evade the power of the five elements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man said nothing, but a bitter smile appeared on his face. Suddenly, his entire body turned red as all the blood inside exploded out. Popping sounds could be heard as it was transformed into a bloody mist. At the same time, a golden light flew out from within him, transforming his entire body, from inside to out, into a statue made of gold. However, he still wasn’t dead. The fact that he theoretically had a chance to survive was like a bitter torment as he fell toward the ground. But then, a sea of flames erupted out from inside of him, burning him dead, body and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-513\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-515\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-514","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
