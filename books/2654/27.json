The grand duchess looked unhappy to see me go. \"Are you quite sure?\" she asked Maman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She looks so fragile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe she needs to be in familiar surroundings,\" Maman said, gathering up her things. She had apparently sat at the side of my bed and knitted an entire coverlet while I had been unconscious. \"Are you ready, darling?\" she asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pale winter sunshine outside seemed painfully bright to me after I\u0027d been indoors for so long. I had to shield my eyes. \"Into the carriage, dear,\" Maman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to say my goodbye to the grand duchess. \"You have been most kind, Your Highness. Thank you for everything you have done for me.\" She smiled. \"It has been a pleasure, Duchess. I hope you are feeling better soon. Perhaps we will see you at the ball et this weekend.\" That evening, Prince Danilo and his sisters came by to see me. Maman insisted I dress and receive them in the parlor. The prince gave me an exquisite four-carat diamond Cartier engagement ring. \"I\u0027ve been so worried about you, my love,\" he said, kissing my hand. \"It has seemed like forever since I\u0027ve seen your beautiful face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am fine, honestly.\" There was something in his touch, his eyes that was so mesmerizing! I could feel myself slipping under his spell again, even with Princess Cantacuzene\u0027s ring, now hidden safely on a ribbon around my neck. I stood up and took a deep breath, trying to shake my senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be attending the ball et?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you are feeling quite better, my dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t miss it for the world. Jelena Cornalba is dancing.\" The enchanting ball erina from Italy had such a following that when she performed in Moscow, the front six rows of the Mariinsky Theatre were usually empty, as several of her fans traveled to Moscow to see her there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was extremely fortunate that the Montenegrins left before Dr. Kruglevski made his visit that evening. He talked jovially with my father and mother before coming in to examine me in my bedroom. Maman huddled over him. \"Do you think she is much improved from this morning? Her fiance came to visit earlier. I hope he did not tire her out.\" The doctor smiled warmly and felt my pulse. \"Do not fear, Duchess. Your blood is free of any poison,\" he said in a low voice. Aloud, to my mother, he said, \"I think she needs a few more days\u0027 rest. I do not suggest any more social outings for the week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the ball et!\" Maman said. \"Oh, well, if it must be, it must be. Your prince will be so disappointed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor said his goodbyes, and Maman kissed me on the forehead before following him downstairs. \"I do hope your prince is not having second thoughts about the engagement. That he does not think you have a poor constitution. You are to be the mother of the future heirs of Montenegro! You should be healthy as a horse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. Maman had the strangest priorities. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-27.html","bookId":2654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
