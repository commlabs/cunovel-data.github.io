It\u0027s not like I have any experience at this. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s Cosmo articles on how to take care of a vampire. Bloodsucking, day-sleeping, turtle-hating, creepy-crawling, no-toilet-paper-buying, inconsiderate bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed an armload of dishes into the sink. \"I didn\u0027t ask for this. A few friends come over for breakfast and she goes bat-shit. Did I make a fuss when her mother came over with no notice? Did I say a word when she brought a dead guy home and shoved him under the bed? No offense, Peary. Do I complain about her weird hours? Her eating habits? No, I haven\u0027t said a word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like I came to the City saying, \u0027Oh, I can\u0027t wait to find a woman whose only joy in life is sucking out my bodily fluids. Okay, well, maybe I did, but I didn\u0027t mean this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy tied up a trash bag full of beer cans and threw it in the corner. The crash reverberated through his head, reminding him of his hangover. He cradled his throbbing temples and went to the bathroom, where he heaved until he thought his stomach would turn inside out. He pushed himself up from the bowl and wiped his eyes. Two snapping turtles regarded him from the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you guys looking at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott\u0027s jaw dropped open and he hissed. Zelda ducked under the foot of fouled water and swam against the corner of the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a shower. You guys are going to have to roam around for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy found a towel and wrestled the turtles out of the tub, then stepped in and ran the shower until the water went cold. As he dressed he watched Scott and Zelda wandering around the bedroom, bumping into walls, then backing up and slumping off until they hit another wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys are miserable here, aren\u0027t you? No one appreciates you? Well, it doesn\u0027t look like Jody\u0027s going to use you. Whoever heard of a vampire with a weak stomach? There\u0027s no reason for all of us to be miserable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy had been using the milk crates he\u0027d carried Scott and Zelda in as laundry baskets. He dumped the dirty laundry on the floor and lined the crates with damp towels. \"Let\u0027s go, guys. We\u0027re going to the park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put Scott in a crate and carried him down the steps to the sidewalk. Then went back up for Zelda and called a cab. When he returned to the street, one of the biker/sculptors was standing outside of the foundry, blotting sweat out of his beard with a bandanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live upstairs, right?\" The sculptor was about thirty-five, long-haired and bearded, wearing grimy jeans and a denim vest with no shirt. His beer belly protruded from the vest and hung over his belt like a great hairy bag of pudding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m Tom Flood.\" Tommy set the crate on the sidewalk and offered his hand. The sculptor clamped down on it until Tommy winced with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Frank. My partner\u0027s Monk. He\u0027s inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short for Monkey. We work in brass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy massaged his crushed hand. \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Balls on a brass monkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Tommy said, nodding as if he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with the turtles?\" Frank asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pets,\" Tommy said. \"They\u0027re getting too big for our place, so I\u0027m going to take a cab over to Golden Gate Park and let them go in the pond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That why your old lady left all pissed off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she doesn\u0027t want them in the house anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking women,\" Frank said in sympathy. \"My last old lady was always on me about keeping my scooter in the living room. I still have the scooter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, in Frank\u0027s eyes, Tommy should be carrying Jody out in a crate. Frank thought he was a wimp. \"No big deal,\" Tommy said with a shrug, \"they were hers. I don\u0027t really care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could use a couple of turtles, if you want to save cab fare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Tommy hadn\u0027t relished the idea of loading the crates into a cab anyway. \"You wouldn\u0027t eat them, would you? I mean, I don\u0027t care, but\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No fucking way, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blue cab pulled up and stopped. Tommy signaled to the driver, then turned back to Frank. \"I\u0027ve been feeding them hamburger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool,\" Frank said. \"I\u0027m on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go.\" Tommy opened the cab door and looked back at Frank. \"Can I visit them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime,\" Frank said. \"Later.\" He bent and picked up the crate containing Zelda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy got in the cab. \"Marina Safeway,\" he said. He would be a couple of hours early for work, but he didn\u0027t want to stay at the loft and risk another tirade if Jody returned. He could kill the time reading or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the cab pulled away he looked out the back window and watched Frank carrying the second crate inside. Tommy felt as if he had just abandoned his children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody thought, I guess not everything changed when I changed. Without realizing how she got there, Jody found herself at Macy\u0027s in Union Square. It was as if some instinctual navigator, activated by conflict with men, had guided her there. A dozen times in the past she had found herself here, arriving with a purse full of tear-smeared Kleenex and a handful of credit cards tilted toward their limit. It was a common, and very human, response. She spotted other women doing the same thing: flipping through racks, testing fabrics, checking prices, fighting back tears and anger, and actually believing salespeople who told them that they looked stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody wondered if department stores knew what percentage of their profits came from domestic unrest. As she passed a display of indecently expensive cosmetics, she spotted a sign that read: \"Melange Youth Cream\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Because he\u0027ll never understand why you\u0027re worth it.\" Yep, they knew. The righteous and the wronged shall find solace in a sale at Macy\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two weeks until Christmas and the stores in Union Square were staying open late into the evening. Tinsel and lights were festooned across every aisle, and every item not marked for sale was decorated with fake evergreen, red and green ribbon, and various plastic approximations of snow. Droves of package-laden shoppers trudged through the aisles like the chorus line of the cheerful, sleigh-bell version of the Bataan Death March, ever careful to keep moving lest some ambitious window dresser mistake them for mannequins and spray them down with aerosol snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody watched the heat trails of the lights, breathed deep the aroma of fudge and candy and a thousand mingled colognes and deodorants, listened to the whir of the motors that animated electric elves and reindeer under the cloak of Muzak-mellowed Christmas carols\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and she liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas is better as a vampire, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowds used to bother her, but now they seemed like... like cattle: harmless and unaware. To her predator side, even the women wearing fur, who used to grate on her nerves, seemed not only harmless, but even enlightened in this heightened sensual world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d like to roll naked on mink, she thought. She frowned to herself. Not with Tommy, though. Not for a while, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself scanning the crowds, looking for the dark aura that betrayed the dying-prey\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then caught herself and shivered. She looked over their heads, like an elevator rider avoiding eye contact, and the gleam of black caught her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a cocktail dress, minimally displayed on an emaciated Venus de Milo mannequin in a Santa hat. The LBD, Little Black Dress: the fashion equivalent of nuclear weapons; public lingerie; effective not because of what it was, but what it wasn\u0027t. You had to have the legs and the body to wear an LBD. Jody did. But you also had to have the confidence, and that she\u0027d never been able to muster. Jody looked down at her jeans and sweatshirt, then at the dress, then at her tennis shoes. She pushed her way through the crowd to the dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rotund, tastefully dressed saleswoman approached Jody from behind. \"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody\u0027s gaze was trained on the dress as if it were the Star of Bethlehem and she was overstocked with frankincense and myrrh. \"I need to see that dress in a three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" the woman said. \"I\u0027ll bring you a five and a seven as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody looked at the woman for the first time and saw the woman looking at her sweatshirt as if it would sprout tentacles and strangle her at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A three will be fine,\" Jody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A three might be a bit snug,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the idea,\" Jody said. She smiled politely, imagining herself snatching out handfuls of the woman\u0027s tastefully tinted hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now let\u0027s get the item number off of that,\" the woman said, making a show of holding the tag so that Jody could see the price. She sneaked a look for Jody\u0027s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s paying,\" Jody said, just to be irritating. \"It\u0027s a gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, how nice,\" the woman said, trying to brighten, but obviously disgusted. Jody understood. Six months ago she would have hated the kind of woman she was pretending to be. The woman said, \"This will be lovely for holiday parties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it\u0027s for a funeral.\" Jody couldn\u0027t remember having this much fun while shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sorry.\" The woman looked apologetic and held her hands to her heart in sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay; I didn\u0027t know the deceased very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody lowered her eyes. \"His wife,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get the dress,\" the woman said, turning and hurrying away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy had only been in the Safeway once before when it was still open: the day he applied for the job. Now it seemed entirely too active and entirely too quiet without the Stones or Pearl Jam blasting over the speakers. He felt that his territory had been somehow violated by strangers. He resented the customers who ruined the Animals\u0027 work by taking things off the shelves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he passed the office he nodded to the manager and headed to the breakroom to kill time until it was time to go to work. The breakroom was a windowless room behind the meat department, furnished with molded plastic chairs, a Formica folding table, a coffee machine, and a variety of safety posters. Tommy brushed some crumbs off a chair, found a coffee-stained Reader\u0027s Digest under an opened package of stale bear claws, and sat down to read and sulk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read: \"A Bear\u0027s Got Mom!: Drama in Real Life\" and \"I Am Joe\u0027s Duodenum\"; and he was beginning to feel a pull toward the bathroom and the Midwest, both things he associated with Reader\u0027s Digest, when he flipped to an article entitled: \"Bats: Our Wild and Wacky Winged Friends\" and felt his duodenum quiver with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone entered the breakroom, and without looking up, Tommy said, \"Did you know that if the brown bat fed on humans instead of insects, that one bat could eat the entire population of Minneapolis in one night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know that,\" said a woman\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy looked up from the magazine to see the new cashier, Mara, pulling a chair out from the table. She was tall and a little thin, but large-breasted: a blue-eyed blonde of about twenty. Tommy had been expecting one of the box boys and he stared at her for a second while he changed gears. \"Oh, hi. I\u0027m Tom Flood. I\u0027m on the night crew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen you,\" she said. \"I\u0027m Mara. I\u0027m new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy smiled. \"Nice to meet you. I came in a little early to catch up on some paperwork.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reader\u0027s Digest?\" She raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, this? No, I don\u0027t normally read it. I just spotted this article on bats and decided to check it out. They\u0027re our wild and wacky winged friends, you know?\" He looked at the page as if to confirm his interest. \"For instance, did you know that the vampire bat is the only mammal that has been successfully frozen and thawed out alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, bats give me the creeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" Tommy said, throwing the magazine aside. \"Do you read?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been reading the Beats. I just moved here and I want to get a feeling for the City\u0027s literature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding. I\u0027ve only been here a few months myself. It\u0027s a great city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t had a chance to look around much. Moving and everything. I left a bad situation back home and I\u0027ve been trying to adjust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look at him when she talked. Tommy assumed at first that it was because she found him disgusting, but after studying her he realized that she was just shy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been to North Beach? The Beats all lived there in the fifties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t know my way around yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you have to go to City Lights Books, and Enrico\u0027s. And the bars up there all have pictures of Kerouac and Ginsberg on the walls. You can almost hear the jazz playing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara finally looked up at him and smiled. \"You\u0027re interested in the Beats?\" Her eyes were wide, bright, and crystal-blue. He liked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a writer,\" Tommy said. It was his turn to look away. \"I mean, I want to be a writer. I used to live in Chinatown, it\u0027s right next to North Beach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you could give me directions to some of the hot spots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could show you,\" Tommy said. As soon as he said it he wanted to retract the offer. Jody would kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be wonderful, if you wouldn\u0027t mind. I don\u0027t know anyone in the City except the other cashiers, and they all have home lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy was confused. The manager had said that she had recently lost a child. He assumed that she was married. He didn\u0027t want it to appear that he was trying to make a move on her. He didn\u0027t really want to make a move on her. But if he were still single, unattached...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Jody wouldn\u0027t understand. Having never had a girlfriend before, he\u0027d never been tempted to stray. He had no idea how to deal with it. He said, \"I could show you and your husband around a little and the two of you could have a night on the town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m divorced,\" Mara said. \"I wasn\u0027t married very long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara shook her head as if to dismiss his sympathy. \"It\u0027s a short story. I got pregnant and we got married. The baby died and he left.\" She said it without feeling, as if she had distanced herself emotionally from the experience\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as if it had happened to someone else. \"I\u0027m trying to make a new start.\" She checked her watch. \"I\u0027d better get back up front. I\u0027ll see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood and started to leave the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mara,\" Tommy called and she turned. \"I\u0027d love to show you around if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that. Thanks. I\u0027m working days for the rest of the week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Tommy said. \"How about tomorrow night? I don\u0027t have a car, but we can meet in North Beach at Enrico\u0027s if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Write down the address.\" She took a slip of paper and a pen from her purse and handed it to him. He scribbled the address and handed it back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven it is,\" she said, and left the breakroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy thought: I\u0027m a dead man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody turned in front of the mirror, admiring the way the LED fit. It was cut down to the small of her back and had a neckline that plunged to the sternum, but was held together at her cleavage with a transparent black mesh. The saleswoman stood beside her, frowning, holding larger sizes of the same dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to try the five, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody said, \"No, this one is fine. I\u0027ll need some sheer black nylons to go with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saleswoman fought down a grimace and managed a professional smile. \"And do you have shoes to match?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suggestions?\" Jody asked, not looking away from her reflection. She thought, I wouldn\u0027t have been caught dead in something like this a few months ago. Oh hell, I\u0027m caught dead in everything now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody laughed at the thought and the saleswoman took it personally and dropped her polite smile. An edge of disgust in her voice, she said, \"I suppose you could complete the look with a pair of Italian fuck-me pumps and some maroon lipstick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody turned to the dowdy woman and gave her a knowing smile. \"You\u0027ve done this before, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a visit to the shoe department, Jody found herself at the cosmetics counter where an ebullient gay man talked her into \"doing her colors\" on the computer. He stared at the screen in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my goodness. This is exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jody said impatiently. She just wanted to buy some lipstick and get out. She\u0027d satisfied her shopping Jones by reducing the woman in evening wear to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my first winter,\" said Maurice. (His name was Maurice; it said so on his badge.) \"You know, I\u0027ve done a thousand autumns, and I get springs out the yin-yang, but a winter... We are going to have fun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice began piling samples of eye shadow, lipstick, mascara, and powder on the counter next to the winter color palette. He opened a tube of mascara and held it next to Jody\u0027s face. \"This one\u0027s called Elm Blight, it approximates the color of dead trees in the snow. It complements your eyes wonderfully. Go ahead, dear, try it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Jody brushed the mascara onto her lashes, using the magnifying mirror on the counter, Maurice read from the Winter Woman\u0027s profile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027The Winter Woman is as wild as a blizzard, as fresh as new snow. While some see her as cold, she has a fiery heart under that ice-queen exterior. She likes the stark simplicity of Japanese art and the daring complexity of Russian literature. She prefers sharp to flowing lines, brooding to pouting, and rock and roll to country and western. Her drink is vodka, her car is German, her analgesic is Advil. The Winter Woman likes her men weak and her coffee strong. She is prone to anemia, hysteria, and suicide. \" Maurice stepped back from the counter and took a deep bow, as if he had just finished a dramatic reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody looked up from the mirror and blinked, the lashes on her right eye describing a starlike Clockwork Orange pattern against her pale skin. \"They can tell all of that from my coloring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice nodded and brandished a sable brush. \"Here, dear, let\u0027s try some of this blush to bring up those cheekbones. It\u0027s called American Rust, it emulates the color of a 63 Rambler that has been driven on salted roads. Very winter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody leaned on the counter to allow Maurice access to her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later she looked in the mirror, rotated now to the non-magnified side, and pursed her lips. For the first time she really looked like a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish we had a camera,\" Maurice gushed. \"You are a winter masterpiece.\" He handed her a small bag filled with cosmetics. \"That will be three hundred dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody paid him. \"Is there somewhere I can change? I\u0027d like to see how I look with my new outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice pointed across the store. \"There\u0027s a changing room over there. And don\u0027t forget your free gift, dear, the Needless Notions Lotion Collection, a fifty-dollar value.\" Maurice held up a plastic faux-Gucci gym bag full of bottles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" Jody took the bag and sulked off toward the changing room. Halfway across the store she picked up the sound of the dowdy saleswoman from evening wear and turned to see her talking to Maurice. Jody focused and could hear what they were saying over the crowd and Christmas Muzak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did it go?\" asked the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice grinned. \"She went away looking like a Donner Party Barbie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman and Maurice exchanged a gleeful high five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitches, Jody thought. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1/page-15.html","bookId":2047,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:46 PM"}
