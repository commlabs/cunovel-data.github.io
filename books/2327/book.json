Now the ex-cop and unlicensed p.i. has been hired to prove that socialite Richard Thurman orchestrated the brutal murder of his beautiful, pregnant wife. During Scudder\u0027s hard drinking years, he left a piece of his soul on every seedy corner of the Big Apple. But this case is more depraved and more potentially devastating than anything he experienced while floundering in the urban depths. Because this investigation is leading Scudder on a frightening grand tour of New York\u0027s sex-for-sale underworld -- where an innocent young life is simply a commodity to be bought and perverted ... and then destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:57 AM"}
