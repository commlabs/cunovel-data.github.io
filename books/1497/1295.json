He looked at the latter’s reddened face and said. “I am helping you look at the Dou Qi seal within your body…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun was startled when she heard this. She continued to stare at Xiao Yan somewhat doubtfully. A moment later, her struggling hand finally weakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA helpless expression also surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face when he saw this. His hand was placed on Yun Yun’s arm before he shut his eyes. A trace of Spiritual Strength flowed along his hand and entered the latter’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun sighed gently when Xiao Yan shut his eyes. However, her face still had an embarrassing red colour remaining on it. Regardless of what the intention of this fellow was, this place was ultimately a public one. Many disciples and Elders from the Flower Sect were below. Just how it would look like if they saw this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slowly opened his eyes while Yun Yun was complaining in her heart. At this moment, there was an additional solemness on his face. The Dou Qi seal within Yun Yun’s body caused even him to feel shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Base on what teacher had said, that Granny Hua should be an elite Dou Zun whose strength had reached that of an eight or nine star Dou Zun. The Dou Qi from her entire lifetime could completely shatter an ordinary Dou Zun…” Xiao Yan’s eyes flickered while he mused. Yun Yun body did indeed possess a vast and mighty Dou Qi that caused even him to feel shocked. However, these Dou Qi was being completely sealed by an extremely powerful seal. With Yun Yun’s strength, she would require quite a long time in order to break the seal and control these vast and mighty Dou Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That Granny Hua is too cautious. The seal that she has placed is too strong. With your current strength, the rate at which you can refine it can be a little faster.” Xiao Yan released Yun Yun’s hand, raised his head and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are also aware that the seal is extremely powerful. With my strength, it is impossible for me to break it. All I can do is to absorb those Dou Qi that seeped out from the seal. Even though this was the case, my training speed is much faster when compared to the past.” Yun Yun knitted her brows and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is safer to refine all of these Dou Qi as soon as possible. Otherwise, if you end up meeting a strong person, it is likely that that person might remove the Dou Qi seal without due care for your life.” Xiao Yan spoke seriously. All of the Dou Qi left behind by an eight or nine star Dou Zun was quite a tempting treasure. It was difficult to be certain that some experts would not end up having other wayward thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun also nodded slightly when she heard this. She understood that Xiao Yan would not lie to her. However, it was not that she did not wish to speed up the rate of refinement but she was really unable to do anything to that seal…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, leave the matter of the seal to me. I will resolve this matter before leaving. Otherwise, I will really be unable to be at ease…” Xiao Yan smiled involuntarily and said when he saw her expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unknown emotion surged up Yun Yun’s heart as she observed the smiling young man in front of her. The feeling of having someone to rely on… was really good… she had brought Nalan Yanran and roamed all over the place during these years. Although her strength could be considered to be at the top within the Jia Nan Empire, it was nothing in this Central Plains where numerous experts were present. Two ladies who possessed such beauty naturally attracted a lot of attention. Hence, Yun Yun brought Nalan Yanran to join the Flower Sect. All she sought was some peace. However, she had really never thought about the position of the Flower Sect’s chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun gently inhaled a breath of air. She suppressed the somewhat weak emotion in her heart and whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan frowned when he heard this. He stared at the beautiful face and asked, “Is it necessary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun raised her pretty eyes after appearing to hear the displeased tone that Xiao Yan had used. She looked at the frown of the latter before involuntarily smiling. A faint warmth was present in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan felt a little sorry at having caused such a great commotion within the Flower Sect. He specially apologise to the First Elder of the Flower Sect. Now that the First Elder had the intention to befriend Xiao Yan and the Falling Star Pavilion, she would naturally not be concerned about this. Hence, this small matter just passed in this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe so called unnatural phenomenon had also gradually faded after the disciples of the Flower Sect had talked about it for two to three days. This was also as Xiao Yan desired. He did not wish to be looked at by many strange eyes each time he went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint fragrance lingered within a room that was filled with a pale pink colour. At a glance, one would understand that this was likely the room of a certain lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will forcefully tear a crack line later on in order to aid your refinement in the future. It might be a little pain. You must endure it.” Xiao Yan looked at Yun Yun, who was seated on the soft bed. His thought also shifted from this room that had a pink colour before coughing dryly and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun agreed softly. At this moment, her face was still a little red. This was because even until now, she did not know why she would suddenly become hot headed and bring Xiao Yan to her own room. It was fine just using any room. Yet, she must bring him here. This was especially case when Xiao Yan displayed a strange expression after just entering this place. It caused her to have the impulse of burying her head into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan laughed dryly when he saw that the tip of Yun Yun’s ears were still red. After which, he exhaled a long breath of air. He tossed aside the distracting thoughts and gradually focused his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his mind became focused, Xiao Yan curled his fingers and a wisp of purple-brown flame that contained traces of dense whiteness within it slowly appeared on his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis flame was naturally something that was created after having merged the Bone Chilling Flame with the other flames. Currently, the four types of Heavenly Flames had completely merged together. Both its colour and its might had become greater. Moreover, this kind of Heavenly Flame currently gave one a somewhat unusual feeling. The extremely heat hid a kind of extremely cold force. The difficulty in dealing with it had multiplied by a couple of times. One could imagine the harm it would cause the other party if this kind of unusual force invaded the other party’s body when fighting other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s expression had become grave when the flame appeared. An instant later, his fingers heavily pressed on Yun Yun’s arm in a lightning like fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Xiao Yan did not strengthen the temperature of the flame, the high temperature that the body of the flame contained still burnt the clothes on Yun Yun’s back into ashes, revealing her naked jade like alluring curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coolness that had suddenly appeared on her back also caused Yun Yun to exclaim. Her face reddened immediately. However, a solemn cry that was transmitted from beside her year caused her to have no choice but to withdraw the ripple within her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Focus! Protect your own veins. I am about to break the seal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun clenched her silver teeth in the face of this grave cry by Xiao Yan. She forcefully suppressed the fluctuation within her heart and swiftly focused his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s hand, where a flame was lingering on, pointed on Yun Yun’s back. That smooth jade like back immediately revealed a purple-red shot. Waves after waves of hot flames followed this spot and continuously poured into Yun Yun’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavenly Flame suddenly invaded in a large scale fashion. The high temperature also spread, causing Yun Yun to painfully circulate her Dou Qi in a hurried fashion. It wrapped around every vein. Only then did she feel a little better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Xiao Yan’s control, the Heavenly Flame quietly shuttled passed the many veins before finally reaching the spot in Yun Yun’s body where her Dou Qi was sealed. He prepared a little before letting out a cry and charged ruthlessly towards the strong seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two collided. Yun Yun’s lovely body paused immediately. The Dou Qi within his body shook intensely at this moment. Waves after waves of intense pain continued to spread from within her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s face was grave. The toughness of the seal had exceeded his expectations. With his current strength, it was impossible for him to continue to destroy it. Moreover, if the seal was completely destroyed, the vast and mighty Dou Qi that surged out would instantly destroy Yun Yun’s body. Of course, his aim was not this. All he wanted to do was to cut and form a crack line on the seal. With his current strength and the help of the Heavenly Flame, it should not be too difficult to achieve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang bang bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA continuous amount of flame surged into Yun Yun’s body. After which, it collided against the tough seal without fearing death. Numerous low and deep sound repeatedly resounded within Yun Yun’s body. That intense pain also became increasingly worse. Fortunately, she was aware that this was a critical matter. She clenched her teeth tightly and did not emit any sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not believe that I cannot even form a crack line on you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan frowned slightly after striking at the seal for a long time to no avail. Immediately, he inhaled a deep breath of air. He could already sense that the spot on the seal where he had attacked had began to fluctuate. Immediately, he clenched his teeth. An unusually dense flame suddenly charged into Yun Yun’s body. Immediately, it formed numerous spinning flames as it violently collided onto the seal that was rippling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collision this time around was unpresented. Powerful force spread apart from the point of collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force spread and Yun Yun’s face paled almost instantly. A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out. That force was really too powerful. If it was not because she had used the Dou Qi to protect her veins earlier, it was likely that even her veins would have been completely broken during this collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mouthful of fresh blood was spat out. However, Yun Yun’s aura did not weaken as a result. Instead, waves after waves of powerful Dou Qi fluctuation suddenly surged from within her body. The strength of that fluctuation was such that it even forced back Xiao Yan’s finger, which was in contact with Yun Yun’s fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What powerful Dou Qi…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surprise flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes when his finger was forced away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun’s shut eyes were suddenly opened as she sat on the bed. Powerful Dou Qi erupted out as though they were real substance. The table a short distance in front emitted a crack sound before shattering into dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The seal had been broken huh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA joy surfaced on Yun Yun’s face when she saw this scene. She suddenly raised her head. Her eyes looked towards Xiao Yan, only to find that the latter was staring at her with a strange expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun was startled when she saw this gaze of Xiao Yan. Immediately, she lowered her head slightly. Her face became fiery hot almost instantly. This was because the clothes on her body had completely burst apart due to the eruption of her Dou Qi earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, a naked beautiful body sat enchantingly within the room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1294\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1296\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1295","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
