I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds finishes her soup and waves the spoon at me. \"You might have a broken rib.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s just bruised,\" I say, trying to reassure her as much as myself. Right before I pinned Vic in the second round, he knocked me to the ground and took a five-pointer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won the match, but the coach still gave me hell for playing dirty the first round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait until the daffodils bloom,\" Maggie says, her eyes sparkling with the candles shining on them. My hands are clammy from nervousness, I have no clue why. \"You\u0027re going to have to take a picture for me and send it to Spain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still can\u0027t believe she\u0027s leaving. Just when I fell for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of Spain ...\" Mrs. Reynolds hands her an envelope. \"Enjoy your journey, but always remember where you came from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie raises a glass with water filled in it. \"Who can forget Paradise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe clink our glasses together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we eat, I open the boxes from Irina, the chef from Auntie Mae\u0027s. As I set samples of pies in front of Maggie and Mrs. Armstrong, you\u0027d swear they were related by the elated expressions on their faces. We all take a fork and dig in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has been the most magnificent day of my life since Albert died, may he rest in peace. Thank you both. But these weary bones need a rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Maggie asks, concern lacing her voice. We both get up to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you two sit down and enjoy. I just need to rest a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless to what the old lady is claiming, Maggie helps her upstairs while I clear the dishes. \"She okay?\" I ask when Maggie comes back outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. She went to the doctor yesterday. He wants to run some tests on her, but she\u0027s too stubborn to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Maggie. God, anyone who\u0027s with her is infected by her humility and honesty. \"Care to dance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" she says. \"Not with my leg ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take her hand in mine and lead her back into the gazebo. \"Dance with me, Maggie,\" I urge as I put one arm around her back and pull her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sway to the music. Slowly she relaxes into my arms. \"I never imagined it would be like this,\" she says into my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her leg starts to hurt, I clear a place on the floor and we lie side by side next to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you ever see in Kendra?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, I don\u0027t know. \"She was popular and pretty. Someone who all the guys wished they could date. She used to look at me as if I was the only guy who could ever make her happy.\" She sits up. \"Okay, now you sound like a jerk.\" I was one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lies next to me, my arm as her pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watch the candles burn down one by one. When there\u0027s only one candle left, I kiss her soft lips and trace her curves with my hands until she\u0027s breathless and weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see your scars,\" I say when we\u0027re both panting and coming up for air from making out. I take the hem of her dress in my fist and slowly slide the material up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stills my hand with her own and smoothes the material back down. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... I can\u0027t,\" she murmurs. \"Not with my scars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words hit me like a cell door slamming closed. Because even if she thinks she forgave me, even if she made promises of forgiveness, even if she kisses me like I\u0027m her hero, I finally realize she can\u0027t get over her anger inside. And never will fully trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie back, totally frustrated, and lay my arm over my eyes. \"This isn\u0027t going to work, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie sits up. \"I\u0027m trying,\" she says, her voice full of regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to tell Maggie I wasn\u0027t responsible for hurting her leg, but I can\u0027t. What if Leah was right? I can\u0027t let my sister go to jail when I\u0027ve already paid for her mistake. I\u0027m committed to living with that blame forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night of the accident, I was supposed to drive Leah home. But I was too drunk and enraged from Maggie\u0027s accusations. Staying with Kendra and making sure she didn\u0027t go home with any other guy was more important than anything else. My fucking ego. I had no idea Leah took my keys until she came back to the party ranting like a lunatic about an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest, as they say, is history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had everything I wanted and I screwed it up. Caleb loved me, all I had to do was show him my scars to prove to him how much I trust and love him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t. Something was pulling me back into my protective shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told my mom I was too sick to go to school today, so I\u0027m lying in bed. The dress Mrs. Reynolds bought me is hanging in my closet, a cruel reminder of the most romantic evening of my life. I won Caleb and lost him just as quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he took me home and we parted, he gave me a small smile and said we\u0027ve always been friends, and we\u0027d remain friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the most important thing. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why have I been crying the entire morning? I call Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house to see how she\u0027s doing after last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds answers the phone. \"Hello?\" he says, his voice shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, it\u0027s Maggie ... Margaret. Is Mrs. Reynolds there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds doesn\u0027t say anything for a long time, and my throat gets a huge lump in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom died this morning, Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whisper as my life comes crashing down on me. \"It can\u0027t be true. We were together. Last night she was dancing and laughing and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was grateful to have you in her life,\" he says. \"She loved you as a granddaughter. More than that, she loved you as a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she? Was she alone when she died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds sniffles. \"They just took her away in an ambulance. She died in her sleep, no pain. Her heart has been bad for years, Maggie. It was only a matter of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears roll down my cheeks as I remember the times we spent in the past few months. She taught me so much about life. \"The daffodils ... she\u0027ll never see the daffodils come up,\" I say, stifling my emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama loved those daffodils, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what else to say to him. Mrs. Reynolds may have been up in years, but there was so much she still had planned. Having my mom and me over for dinner, watching the daffodils bloom in the spring. Eating Irina\u0027s pies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you will. She never wanted a funeral. She said they\u0027re just an excuse for depressed people to make senseless chatter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile wistfully. \"That sounds like her.\" She just accused me of it yesterday, which reminds me ... \"A dress. She bought a dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blue one slung over the chair in her bedroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. If she\u0027s going to be buried ...\" I can\u0027t even get out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make sure of it. Listen, if you want to come over and take something from the house before we sell it, you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t sell the house.\" The daffodils, the gazebo ... everything she cared about in the last two months are for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the evening, my mom drives me over to Mrs. Reynolds house for the last time. She\u0027s holding my hand as Lou greets us. \"Take anything you want, Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the laundry room, all clean and folded, is the muumuu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick it up and clutch it to my chest. It was Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 way of protecting me, covering my clothes so I wouldn\u0027t get dirty. \"Can I have this?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds seems surprised I\u0027d want it, but says, \"I was serious when I said anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s two more things I want. I head to the kitchen and open cabinets until I find it. My mom is shrugging to Mr. Reynolds, who is as baffled as her. \"It\u0027s got to be around here somewhere. Aha.\" I open one of the top drawers and on a piece of old, stained and ripped linen paper is her favorite Snickerdoodle cookie recipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Mr. Reynolds follow me up to the attic. I head for the trunk and open it up. Holding up a picture frame, I say \"This is the last thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds says, \"It\u0027s yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the picture of two people madly in love on their wedding day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay they both rest in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie wasn\u0027t at school yesterday, and I haven\u0027t seen her all morning. Twice today I\u0027ve passed by her locker, but she\u0027s been as elusive as a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring third period I can\u0027t focus. So I take the bathroom pass and head out the door. But I don\u0027t head straight to the bathroom. I turn the corner and go down the hall where I know her locker is. I\u0027ve turned into a stalker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking for someone, Caleb?\" It\u0027s Kendra, with a hall pass of her own dangling from her fingers. \"Maggie Armstrong, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop playing games with me, Kend.\" She flashes a wicked smile. \"No, seriously. I just don\u0027t get what you see in her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I say just to get my ex off my back. \"I see nothing in Maggie Armstrong. If anything she\u0027s been a distraction because I can\u0027t have you.\" The bullshit is flying because I need to protect Maggie and Leah at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of someone behind me makes me turn around. It\u0027s Maggie. She\u0027s heard every lying word out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra slinks toward her. \"Caleb, did you tell Maggie the truth about the accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kendra. Don\u0027t,\" I say in a warning tone. \"Or I\u0027ll clue Brian in about what\u0027s been going on between you and me. Isn\u0027t your dad\u0027s election next week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Kendra had claws, they\u0027d be out and she\u0027d be murderous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie hobbles toward me. \"What\u0027s been going on between you and Kendra, Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra puts her hands on her hips, ready for this battle to begin. \"Yeah, Caleb. Tell her how many times we\u0027ve been together since you came back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I say? I want to tell Maggie the truth, I\u0027m going to tell her the truth. About everything. But not here, not in front of Kendra. She\u0027s got nothing to do with me and Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say something,\" Maggie orders, her eyes on fire. When I don\u0027t, she slaps me and limps away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate pep rallies. So I find it insane that I\u0027m stuck in the middle of one today, of all days. But here I am, in the center of the crowd of athletes while the cheerleaders lead the rest of the school in pepping the entire student body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if a bunch of wrestlers want to be \"peppy.\" But the guys\u0027ll take any excuse to ditch class for an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeyer stands at the podium as if he\u0027s the president of the United States instead of principal of a small-town school. \"Settle down, everyone. Settle down.\" The place is still noisy, but it\u0027s the best he\u0027s going to get and he knows it. \"This is a time to celebrate the students who represent the Paradise Panthers in athletics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd starts getting restless, the gymnasium floor vibrating from the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle down. Settle down. We\u0027re going to honor our athletes this afternoon. Each coach is going to come up and announce the members of their teams. Let\u0027s start with our largest team ... football!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sets the cheerleaders into a frenzy, kicking and cartwheeling all over the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your hand up when I call your name,\" the football coach says. \"Adam Albers, Nate Atkins, Max Ballinski, Ty Edmonds ...\" The list goes on and on for what seems like forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing next to Brian. \"This is torture, man.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-26.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
