He raised his handkerchief to his eyes, and his shoulders heaved up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDennis Trevor\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a.k.a. Brandon Higgins\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;seated next to him, looked at him in surprise. \"Hey,\" he said, \"it\u0027s only money. It\u0027s nothing to cry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff Stevens turned to him with tears streaming down his face, and Higgins, to his astonishment, saw that Jeff was convulsed with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s the matter with you?\" Higgins demanded. \"It\u0027s nothing to laugh about, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Jeff, it was. The manner in which Tracy Whitney had outwitted them at the airport was the most ingenius con he had ever witnessed. A scam on top of a scam. Conrad Morgan had told them the woman was an amateur. My God, Jeff thought, what would she be like if she were a professional? Tracy Whitney was without doubt the most beautiful woman Jeff Stevens had ever seen. And clever. Jeff prided himself on being the best confidence artist in the business, and she had outsmarted him. Uncle Willie would have loved her, Jeff thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Uncle Willie who had educated Jeff. Jeff\u0027s mother was the trusting heiress to a farm-equipment fortune, married to an improvident schemer filled with get-rich-quick projects that never quite worked out. Jeff\u0027s father was a charmer, darkly handsome and persuasively glib, and in the first five years of marriage he had managed to run through his wife\u0027s inheritance. Jeff\u0027s earliest memories were of his mother and father quarreling about money and his father\u0027s extramarital affairs. It was a bitter marriage, and the young boy had resolved, I\u0027m never going to get married. Never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father\u0027s brother, Uncle Willie, owned a small traveling carnival, and whenever he was near Marion, Ohio, where the Stevenses lived, he came to visit them. He was the most cheerful man Jeff had ever known, filled with optimism and promises of a rosy tomorrow. He always managed to bring the boy exciting gifts, and he taught Jeff wonderful magic tricks. Uncle Willie had started out as a magician at a carnival and had taken it over when it went broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jeff was fourteen, his mother died in an automobile accident. Two months later Jeff\u0027s father married a nineteen-year-old cocktail waitress. \"It isn\u0027t natural for a man to live by himself,\" his father had explained. But the box was filled with a deep resentment, feeling betrayed by his father\u0027s callousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff\u0027s father had been hired as a siding salesman and was on the road three days a week. One night when Jeff was alone in the house with his stepmother, he was awakened by the sound of his bedroom door opening. Moments later he felt a soft, naked body next to his. Jeff sat up in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold me, Jeffie,\" his stepmother whispered. \"I\u0027m afraid of thunder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it isn\u0027t thundering,\" Jeff stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it could be. The paper said rain.\" She pressed her body close to his. \"Make love to me, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was in a panic. \"Sure. Can we do it in Dad\u0027s bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She laughed. \"Kinky, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right there,\" Jeff promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid out of bed and went into the other bedroom. Jeff had never dressed faster in his life. He went out the window and headed for Cimarron, Kansas, where Uncle Willie\u0027s carnival was playing. He never looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Uncle Willie asked Jeff why he had run away from home, all he would say was, \"I don\u0027t get along with my stepmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Willie telephoned Jeff\u0027s father, and after a long conversation, it was decided that the boy should remain with the carnival. \"He\u0027ll get a better education here than any school could ever give him,\" Uncle Willie promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carnival was a world unto itself. \"We don\u0027t run a Sunday school show,\" Uncle Willie explained to Jeff. \"We\u0027re flimflam artists. But remember, sonny, you can\u0027t con people unless they\u0027re greedy to begin with. W. C. Fields had it right. You can\u0027t cheat an honest man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carnies became Jeff\u0027s friends. There were the \"front-end\" men, who had the concessions, and the \"back-end\" people, who ran shows like the fat woman and the tattooed lady, and the flat-store operators, who operated the games. The carnival had its share of nubile girls, and they were attracted to the young boy. Jeff had inherited his mother\u0027s sensitivity and his father\u0027s dark, good looks, and the ladies fought over who was going to relieve Jeff of his virginity. His first sexual experience was with a pretty contortionist, and for years she was the high-water mark that other women had to live up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Willie arranged for Jeff to work at various jobs around the carnival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday all this will be yours,\" Uncle Willie told the boy, \"and the only way you\u0027re gonna hang on to it is to know more about it than anybody else does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff started out with the six-cat \"hanky-park,\" a scam where customers paid to throw balls to try to knock six cats made out of canvas with a wood-base bottom into a net. The operator running the joint would demonstrate how easy it was to knock them over, but when the customer tried it, a \"gunner\" hiding in back of the canvas lifted a rod to keep the wooden base on the cats steady. Not even Sandy Koufax could have downed the cats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you hit it too low,\" the operator would say. \"All you have to do is hit it nice and easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice and easy was the password, and the moment the operator said it, the hidden gunner would drop the rod, and the operator would knock the cat off the board. He would then say, \"See what I mean?\" and that was the gunner\u0027s signal to put up the rod again. There was always another rube who wanted to show off his pitching arm to his giggling girl friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff worked the \"count stores,\" where clothespins were arranged in a line. The customer would pay to throw rubber rings over the clothespins, which were numbered, and if the total added up to twenty-nine, he would win an expensive toy. What the sucker did not know was that the clothespins had different numbers at each end, so that the man running the count store could conceal the number that would add up to twenty-nine and make sure the mark never won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day Uncle Willie said to Jeff, \"You\u0027re doin\u0027 real good, kid, and I\u0027m proud of you. You\u0027re ready to move up to the skillo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skillo operators were the cr��me de la cr��me, and all the other carnies looked up to them. They made more money than anyone else in the carnival, stayed at the best hotels, and drove flashy cars. The skillo game consisted of a flat wheel with an arrow balanced very carefully on glass with a thin piece of paper in the center. Each section was numbered, and when the customer spun the wheel and it stopped on a number, that number would be blocked off. The customer would pay again for another spin of the wheel, and another space would be blocked off. The skillo operator explained that when all the spaces were blocked off, the customer would win a large sum of money. As the customer got closer to filling in all the spaces, the skillo operator would encourage him to increase his bets. The operator would look around nervously and whisper, \"I don\u0027t own this game, but I\u0027d like you to win. If you do, maybe you\u0027ll give me a small piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator would slip the customer five or ten dollars and say, \"Bet this for me, will you? You can\u0027t lose now.\" And the mark would feel as though he had a confederate. Jeff became an expert at milking the customers. As the open spaces on the board became smaller and the odds of winning grew greater, the excitement would intensify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t miss now!\" Jeff would exclaim, and the player would eagerly put up more money. Finally, when there was only one tiny space left to fill, the excitement would peak. The mark would put up all the money he had, and often hurry home to get more. The customer never won, however, because the operator or his shill would give the table an imperceptible nudge, and the arrow would invariably land at the wrong place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff quickly learned all the carnie terms: The \"gaff\" was a term for fixing the games so that the marks could not win. The men who stood in front of a sideshow making their spiel were called \"barkers\" by outsiders, but the carnie people called them \"talkers.\" The talker got 10 percent of the take for building the tip\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the \"tip\" being a crowd. \"Slum\" was the prize given away. The \"postman\" was a cop who had to be paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff became an expert at the \"blow-off.\" When customers paid to see a sideshow exhibition, Jeff would make his spiel: \"Ladies and gentlemen: Everything that\u0027s pictured, painted, and advertised outside, you will see within the walls of this tent for the price of your general admission. However, immediately after the young lady in the electric chair gets finished being tortured, her poor body racked by fifty thousand watts of electricity, we have an extra added attraction that has absolutely nothing to do with the show and is not advertised outside. Behind this enclosure you are going to see something so truly remarkable, so chilling and hair-raising, that we dare not portray it outside, because it might come under the eyes of innocent children or susceptible women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after the suckers had paid an extra dollar, Jeff would usher them inside to see a girl with no middle, or a two-headed baby, and of course it was all done with mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most profitable carnival games was the \"mouse running.\" A live mouse was put in the center of a table and a bowl was placed over it. The rim of the table had ten holes around its perimeter into any one of which the mouse could run when the bowl was lifted. Each patron bet on a numbered hole. Whoever selected the hole into which the mouse would run won the prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you gaff a thing like that?\" Jeff asked Uncle Willie. \"Do you use trained mice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Willie roared with laughter. \"Who the hell\u0027s go time to train mice? No, no. It\u0027s simple. The operator sees which number no one has bet on, and he puts a little vinegar on his finger and touches the edge of the hole he wants the mouse to run into. The mouse will head for that hole every time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren, an attractive young belly dancer, introduced Jeff to the \"key\" game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027ve made your spiel on Saturday night,\" Karen told him, \"call some of the men customers aside, one at a time, and sell them a key to my trailer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe keys cost five dollars. By midnight, a dozen or more men would find themselves milling around outside her trailer. Karen, by that time, was at a hotel in town, spending the night with Jeff. When the marks came back to the carnival the following morning to get their revenge, the show was long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the next four years Jeff learned a great deal about human nature. He found out how easy it was to arouse greed, and how guillible people could be. They believed incredible tales because their greed made them want to believe. At eighteen, Jeff was strikingly handsome. Even the most casual woman observer would instantly note and approve his gray, well-spaced eyes, tall build, and curly dark hair. Men enjoyed his wit and air of easy good humor. Even children, as if speaking to some answering child in him, gave him their confidence immediately. Customers flirted outrageously with Jeff, but Uncle Willie cautioned, \"Stay away from the townies, my boy. Their fathers are always the sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the knife thrower\u0027s wife who caused Jeff to leave the carnival. The show had just arrived in Milledgeville, Georgia, and the tents were being set up. A new act had signed on, a Sicilian knife thrower called the Great Zorbini and his attractive blond wife. While the Great Zorbini was at the carnival setting up his equipment, his wife invited Jeff to their hotel room in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zorbini will be busy all day,\" she told Jeff. \"Let\u0027s have some fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me an hour and then come up to the room,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wait an hour?\" Jeff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and said, \"It will take me that long to get everything ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff waited, his curiosity increasing, and when he finally arrived at the hotel room, she greeted him at the door, stark naked. He reached for her, but she took his hand and said, \"Come in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked into the bathroom and stared in disbelief. She had filled the bathtub with six flavors of Jell-O, mixed with warm water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Jeff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dessert. Get undressed, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff undressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, into the tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the tub and sat down, and it was the wildest sensation he had ever experienced. The soft, slippery Jell-O seemed to fill every crevice of his body, massaging him all over. The blonde joined him in the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" she said, \"lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started down his chest toward his groin, licking the Jell-O as she went. \"Mmmm, you taste delicious. I like the strawberry best....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween her rapidly flicking tongue and the friction of the warm, viscous Jell-O, it was an erotic experience beyond description. In the middle of it, the bathroom door flew open and the Great Zorbini strode in. The Sicilian took one look at his wife and the startled Jeff, and howled, \"Tu sei una puttana! Vi ammazzo tutti e due! Dove sono i miei coltelli?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff did not recognize any of the words, but the tone was familiar. As the Great Zorbini raced out of the room to get his knives, Jeff leaped out of the tub, his body looking like a rainbow with the multicolored Jell-O clinging to it, and grabbed his clothes. He jumped out of the window, naked, and began running down the alley. He heard a shout behind him and felt a knife sing past his head. Zing! Another, and then he was out of range. He dressed in a culvert, pulling his shirt and pants over the sticky Jell-O, and squished his way to the depot, where he caught the first bus out of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix months later, he was in Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery soldier fights a different war, and Jeff came out of his Vietnam experience with a deep contempt for bureaucracy and a lasting resentment of authority. He spent two years in a war that could never be won, and he was appalled by the waste of money and mat��riel and lives, and sickened by the treachery and deceit of the generals and politicians who performed their verbal sleight of hand. We\u0027ve been suckered into a war that nobody wants, Jeff thought. It\u0027s a con game. The biggest con game in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week before Jeff\u0027s discharge, he received the news of Uncle Willie\u0027s death. The carnival had folded. The past was finished. It was time for him to enjoy the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe years that followed were filled with a series of adventures. To Jeff, the whole world was a carnival, and the people in it were his marks. He devised his own con games. He placed ads in newspapers offering a color picture of the President for a dollar. When he received a dollar, he sent his victim a postage stamp with a picture of the President on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put announcements in magazines warning the public that there were only sixty days left to send in five dollars, that after that it would be too late. The ad did not specify what the five dollars would buy, but the money poured in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor three months Jeff worked in a boiler room, selling phony oil stocks over the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved boats, and when a friend offered him a job working on a sailing schooner bound for Tahiti, Jeff signed on as a seaman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship was a beauty, a 165-foot white schooner, glistening in the sun, all sails drawing well. It had teak decking, long, gleaming Oregon fir for the hull, with a main salon that sat twelve and a galley forward, with electric ovens. The crew\u0027s quarters were in the forepeak. In addition to the captain, the steward, and a cook, there were five deckhands. Jeff\u0027s job consisted of helping hoist the sails, polishing the brass portholes, and climbing up the ratlines to the lower spreader to furl the sails. The schooner was carrying a party of eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The owner is named Hollander,\" Jeff\u0027s friend informed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollander turned out to be Louise Hollander, a twenty-five year-old, golden-haired beauty, whose father owned half of Central America. The other passengers were her friends, whom Jeff\u0027s buddies sneeringly referred to as the \"jest set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first day out Jeff was working in the hot sun, polishing the brass on deck. Louise Hollander stopped beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re new on board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeff Stevens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nice name.\" He made no comment. \"Do you know who I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Louise Hollander. I own this boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. I\u0027m working for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a slow smile. \"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then if you want to get your money\u0027s worth, you\u0027d better let me get on with my work.\" Jeff moved on to the next stanchion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their quarters at night, the crew members disparaged the passengers and made jokes about them. But Jeff admitted to himself that he was envious of them\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;their backgrounds, their educations, and their easy manners. They had come from monied families and had attended the best schools. His school had been Uncle Willie and the carnival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the carnies had been a professor of archaeology until he was thrown out of college for stealing and selling valuable relics. He and Jeff had had long talks, and the professor had imbued Jeff with an enthusiasm for archaeology. \"You can read the whole future of mankind in the past,\" the professor would say. \"Think of it, son. Thousands of years ago there were people just like you and me dreaming dreams, spinning tales, living out their lives, giving birth to our ancestors.\" His eyes had taken on a faraway look. \"Carthage\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s where I\u0027d like to go on a dig. Long before Christ was born, it was a great city, the Paris of ancient Africa. The people had their games, and baths, and chariot racing. The Circus Maximus was as large as five football fields.\" He had noted the interest in the boy\u0027s eyes. \"Do you know how Cato the Elder used to end his speeches in the Roman Senate? He\u0027d say, \u0027Delenda est cartaga\u0027; \u0027Carthage must be destroyed.\u0027 His wish finally came true. The Romans reduced the place to rubble and came back twenty-five years later to build a great city on its ashes. I wish I could take you there on a dig one day, my boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year later the professor had died of alcoholism, but Jeff had promised himself that one day he would go on a dig. Carthage, first, for the professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the last night before the schooner was to dock in Tahiti, Jeff was summoned to Louise Hollander\u0027s stateroom. She was wearing a sheer silk robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to see me, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a homosexual, Jeff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s any of your business, Miss Hollander, but the answer is no. What I am is choosy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise Hollander\u0027s mouth tightened. \"What kind of women do you like? Whores, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes,\" Jeff said agreeably. \"Was there anything else, Miss Hollander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m giving a dinner party tomorrow night. Would you like to come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff looked at the woman for a long moment before he answered. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the way it began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise Hollander had had two husbands before she was twenty-one, and her lawyer had just made a settlement with her third husband when she met Jeff. The second night they were moored at the harbor in Papeete, and as the passengers and crew were going ashore, Jeff received another summons to Louise Hollander\u0027s quarters. When Jeff arrived, she was dressed in a colorful silk pareu slit all the way up to the thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to get this off,\" she said. \"I\u0027m having a problem with the zipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff walked over and examined the costume. \"It doesn\u0027t have a Zipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to face him, and smiled. \"I know. That\u0027s my problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made love on the deck, where the soft tropical air caressed their bodies like a blessing. Afterward, they lay on their sides, facing each other. Jeff propped himself up on an elbow and looked down at Louise. \"Your daddy\u0027s not the sheriff, is he?\" Jeff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up in surprise. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the first townie I ever made love to. Uncle Willie used to warn me that their daddies always turned out to be the sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were together every night after that. At first Louise\u0027s friends were amused. He\u0027s another one of Louise\u0027s playthings, they thought. But when she informed them that she intended to marry Jeff, they were frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake, Louise, he\u0027s a nothing. He worked in a carnival. My God, you might as well be marrying a stable hand. He\u0027s handsome\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;granted. And he has a fab bod. But outside of sex, you have absolutely nothing in common, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louise, Jeff\u0027s for breakfast, not dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a social position to uphold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frankly, angel, he just won\u0027t fit in, will he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing her friends said could dissuade Louise. Jeff was the most fascinating man she had ever met. She had found that men who were outstandingly handsome were either monumentally stupid or unbearably dull. Jeff was intelligent and amusing, and the combination was irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Louise mentioned the subject of marriage to Jeff, he was as surprised as her friends had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why marriage? You\u0027ve already got my body. I can\u0027t give you anything you don\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very simple, Jeff. I love you. I want to share the rest of my life with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarriage had been an alien idea, and suddenly it no longer was. Beneath Louise Hollander\u0027s worldly, sophisticated veneer; there was a vulnerable, lost little girl. She needs me, Jeff thought. The idea of a stable homelife and children was suddenly immensely appealing. It seemed to him that ever since he could remember, he had been running. It was time to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were married in the town hall in Tahiti three days later..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they returned to New York, Jeff was summoned to the office of Scott Fogarty, Louise Hollander\u0027s attorney, a small, frigid man, tight-lipped and probably, Jeff thought, tight-assed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a paper here for you to sign,\" the attorney announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a release. It simply states that in the event of the dissolution of your marriage to Louise Hollander\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louise Stevens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- Louise Stevens, that you will not participate financially in any of her\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff felt the muscles of his jaw tightening. \"Where do I sign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want me to finish reading?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t think you get the point. I didn\u0027t marry her for her fucking money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, Mr. Stevens! I just\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to sign it or don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawyer placed the paper in front of Jeff. He scrawled his signature and stormed out of the office. Louise\u0027s limousine and driver were waiting for him downstairs. As Jeff climbed in, he had to laugh to himself. What the hell am I so pissed off about? I\u0027ve been a con artist all my life, and when I go straight for the first time and someone thinks I\u0027m out to take them, I behave like a fucking Sunday school teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise took Jeff to the best tailor in Manhattan. \"You\u0027ll look fantastic in a dinner jacket,\" she coaxed. And he did. Before the second month of the marriage, five of Louise\u0027s best friends had tried to seduce the attractive newcomer in their circle, but Jeff ignored them. He was determined to make his marriage work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge Hollander, Louise\u0027s brother, put Jeff up for membership in the exclusive New York Pilgrim Club, and Jeff was accepted. Budge was a beefy, middle-aged man who had gotten his sobriquet playing right tackle on the Harvard football team, where he got the reputation of being a player his opponents could not budge. He owned a shipping line, a banana plantation, cattle ranches, a meat-packing company, and more corporations than Jeff could count. Budge Hollander was not subtle in concealing his contempt for Jeff Stevens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re really out of our class, aren\u0027t you, old boy? But as long as you amuse Louise in bed, that will do nicely. I\u0027m very fond of my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took every ounce of willpower for Jeff to control himself. I\u0027m not married to this prick. I\u0027m married to Louise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other members of the Pilgrim Club were equally obnoxious. They found Jeff terribly amusing. All of them dined at the club every noontime, and pleaded for Jeff to tell them stories about his \"carnie days,\" as they liked to call them. Perversely, Jeff made the stories more and more outrageous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff and Louise lived in a twenty-room townhouse filled with servants, on the East Side of Manhattan. Louise had estates in Long Island and the Bahamas, a villa in Sardinia, and a large apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris. Aside from the yacht, Louise owned a Maserati, a Rolls Corniche, a Lamborghini, and a Daimler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s fantastic, Jeff thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s great, Jeff thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s boring, Jeff thought. And degrading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning he got up from his eighteenth-century four-poster bed, put on a Sulka robe, and went looking for Louise. He found her in the breakfast room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to get a job,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake, darling, why? We don\u0027t need the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has nothing to do with money. You can\u0027t expect me to sit around on my hands and be spoonfed. I have to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise gave it a moment\u0027s thought. \"All right, angel. I\u0027ll speak to Budge. He owns a stockbrokerage firm. Would you like to be a stockbroker, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to get off my ass,\" Jeff muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to work for Budge. He had never had a job with regular hours before. I\u0027m going to love it, Jeff thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated it. He stayed with it because he wanted to bring home a paycheck to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you and I going to have a baby?\" he asked Louise, after a lazy Sunday brunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon, darling. I\u0027m trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to bed. Let\u0027s try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff was seated at the luncheon table reserved for his brother-in-law and half a dozen other captains of industry at the Pilgrim Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge announced, \"We just issued our annual report for the meat-packing company, fellas. Our profits are up forty percent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t they be?\" one of the men at the table laughed. \"You\u0027ve got the fucking inspectors bribed.\" He turned to the others at the table. \"Old clever Budge, here, buys inferior meat and has it stamped prime and sells it for a bloody fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff was shocked. \"People eat meat, for Christ\u0027s sake. They feed it to their children. He\u0027s kidding, isn\u0027t he, Budge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge grinned and whooped, \"Look who\u0027s being moral!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next three months Jeff became very well acquainted with his table companions. Ed Zeller had paid a million in bribes in order to build a factory in Libya. Mike Quincy, the head of a conglomerate, was a raider who bought companies and illegally tipped off his friends when to buy and sell the stock. Alan Thompson, the richest man at the table, boasted of his company\u0027s policy. \"Before they changed the damn law, we used to fire the old gray hairs one year before their pensions were due. Saved a fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the men cheated on taxes, had insurance scams, falsified expense accounts, and put their current mistresses on their payrolls as secretaries or assistants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist, Jeff thought. They\u0027re just dressed-up carnies. They all run flat stores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wives were no better. They grabbed everything they could get their greedy hands on and cheated on their husbands. They\u0027re playing the key game, Jeff marveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he tried to tell Louise how he felt, she laughed. \"Don\u0027t be naive, Jeff. You\u0027re enjoying your life, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that he was not. He had married Louise because he believed she needed him. He felt that children would change everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have one of each. It\u0027s time. We\u0027ve been married a year now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angel, be patient. I\u0027ve been to the doctor, and he told me I\u0027m fine. Maybe you should have a checkup and see if you\u0027re all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have no trouble producing healthy children,\" the doctor assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Black Monday Jeff\u0027s world fell apart. It started in the morning when he went into Louise\u0027s medicine chest for an aspirin. He found a shelf full of birth control pills. One of the cases was almost empty. Lying innocently next to it was a vial of white powder and a small golden spoon. And that was only the start of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon, Jeff was seated in a deep armchair in the Pilgrim Club, waiting for Budge to appear, when he heard two men behind him talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She swears that her Italian singer\u0027s cock is over ten inches long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a snicker. \"Well, Louise always liked them big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re talking about another Louise, Jeff told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably why she married that carnival person in the first place. But she does tell the most amusing stories about him. You won\u0027t believe what he did the other day...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff rose and blindly made his way out of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was filled with a rage such as he had never known. He wanted to kill. He wanted to kill the unknown Italian. He wanted to kill Louise. How many other men had she been sleeping with during the past year? They had been laughing at him all this time. Budge and Ed Zeller and Mike Quincy and Alan Thompson and their wives had been having an enormous joke at his expense. And Louise, the woman he had wanted to protect. Jeff\u0027s immediate reaction was to pack up and leave. But that was not good enough. He had no intention of letting the bastards have the last laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon when Jeff arrived home, Louise was not there. \"Madame went out this morning,\" Pickens, the butler, said. \"I believe she had several appointments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll bet she did, Jeff thought. She\u0027s out fucking that ten-inch-cock Italian. Jesus Christ!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Louise arrived home, Jeff had himself under tight control. \"Did you have a nice day?\" Jeff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the usual boring things, darling. A beauty appointment, shopping.... How was your day, angel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was interesting,\" Jeff said truthfully. \"I learned a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Budge tells me you\u0027re doing beautifully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" Jeff assured her. \"And very soon I\u0027m going to be doing even better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise stroked his hand. \"My bright husband. Why don\u0027t we go to bed early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight,\" Jeff said. \"I have a headache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spent the next week making his plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began at lunch at the club. \"Do any of you know anything about computer frauds?\" Jeff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Ed Zeller wanted to know. \"You planning to commit one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sputter of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m serious,\" Jeff insisted. \"It\u0027s a big problem. People are tapping into computers and ripping off banks and insurance companies and other businesses for billions of dollars. It gets worse all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds right up your alley,\" Budge murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone I met has come up with a computer he says can\u0027t be tampered with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you want to have him knocked off,\" Mike Quincy kidded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, I\u0027m interested in raising money to back him. I just wondered if any of you might know something about computers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Budge grinned, \"but we know everything about backing inventors, don\u0027t we fellas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a burst of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later at the club, Jeff. passed by the usual table and explained to Budge, \"I\u0027m sorry I won\u0027t be able to join you fellows today. I\u0027m having a guest for lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jeff moved on to another table, Alan Thompson grinned, \"He\u0027s probably having lunch with the bearded lady from the circus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stooped, gray-haired man entered the dining room and was ushered to Jeff\u0027s table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus!\" Mike Quincy said. \"Isn\u0027t that Professor Ackerman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Professor Ackerman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever read anything but financial reports, Budge? Vernon Ackerman was on the cover of Time last month. He\u0027s chairman of the President\u0027s National Scientific Board. He\u0027s the most brilliant scientist in the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is he doing with my dear brother-in-law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff and the professor were engrossed in a deep conversation all during lunch, and Budge and his friends grew more and more curious. When the professor left, Budge motioned Jeff over to his table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jeff. Who was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff looked guilty. \"Oh... you mean Vernon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. What were you two talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We... ah...\" The others could almost watch Jeff\u0027s thought processes as he tried to dodge the question. \"I... ah... might write a book about him. He\u0027s a very interesting character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you were a writer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I guess we all have to start sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later Jeff had another luncheon guest. This time it was Budge who recognized him. \"Hey! That\u0027s Seymour Jarrett, chairman of the board of Jarrett International Computer. What the hell would he be doing with Jeff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Jeff and his guest held a long, animated conversation. When the luncheon was over, Budge sought Jeff out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeffrey, boy, what\u0027s with you and Seymour Jarrett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Jeff said quickly. \"Just having a chat.\" He started to walk away. Budge stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast, old buddy. Seymour Jarrett is a very busy fellow. He doesn\u0027t sit around having long chats about nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff said earnestly, \"All right. The truth is, Budge, that Seymour collects stamps, and I told him about a stamp I might be able to acquire for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth, my ass, Budge thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week, Jeff lunched at the club with Charles Bartlett, the president of Bartlett \u0026amp; Bartlett, one of the largest private capital venture groups in the world. Budge, Ed Zeller, Alan Thompson, and Mike Quincy watched in fascination as the two men talked, their heads close together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother-in-law is sure in high-flying company lately,\" Zeller commented. \"What kind of deal has he got cooking, Budge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge said testily, \"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m sure in hell going to find out. If Jarrett and Bartlett are interested, there must be a pot of money involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched as Bartlett rose, enthusiastically pumped Jeff\u0027s hand, and left. As Jeff passed their table, Budge caught his arm. \"Sit down, Jeff. We want to have a little talk with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should get back to the office,\" Jeff protested. \"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You work for me, remember? Sit down.\" Jeff sat. \"Who were you having lunch with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff hesitated. \"No one special. An old friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie Bartlett\u0027s an old friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you and your old friend Charlie discussing, Jeff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... cars, mostly. Old Charlie likes antique cars, and I heard about this \u002737 Packard, four-door convertible\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut the horseshit!\" Budge snapped. \"You\u0027re not collecting stamps or selling automobiles, or writing any fucking book. What are you really up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re raising money for something, aren\u0027t you, Jeff?\" Ed Zeller asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" But he said it a shade too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge put a beefy arm around Jeff. \"Hey, buddy, this is your brother-in-law. We\u0027re family, remember?\" He gave Jeff a bear hug. \"It\u0027s something about that tamper-proof computer you mentioned last week, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could see by the look on Jeff\u0027s face that they had trapped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like pulling teeth to get anything out of the son of a bitch. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell us Professor Ackerman was involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wrong.

They\u0027ll eat you alive,\" Alan Thompson exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Zeller picked it up. \"Jeff, when you deal with friends, you don\u0027t get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything is already arranged,\" Jeff told them. \"Charlie Bartlett\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you signed anything yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I gave my word\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then nothing\u0027s arranged. Hell, Jeff boy, in business people change their minds every hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t even be discussing this with you,\" Jeff protested. \"Professor Ackerman\u0027s name can\u0027t be mentioned.

For all I know, this thing may have no value at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. We understand. But say it does have a value, Jeff How big could this thing be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Budge, the market for this is worldwide. I couldn\u0027t even begin to put a value on it.

How does that suit you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff was biting his lower lip. \"Budge, I promised Mr. Bartlett \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck Bartlett,\" Budge snarled. \"Are you married to his sister or mine?

SUCABA has been extensively tested, is inexpensive, trouble-free, and uses less power than any computer currently on the market. SUCABA will require no maintenance or parts for a minimum period of ten years.\" They were all looking over Jeff\u0027s shoulder as he wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus!\" Ed Zeller said. \"Ten years! There\u0027s not a computer on the market that can claim that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff continued. \"The buyers understand that neither Professor Vernon Ackerman nor I holds a patent on SUCABA\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take care of all that,\" Alan Thompson interrupted impatiently. \"I\u0027ve got one hell of a patent attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff kept writing. \"I have explained to the buyers that SUCABA may have no value of any kind, and that neither Professor Vernon Ackerman nor I makes any representations or warranties about SUCABA except as written above.\" He signed it and held up the paper. \"Is that satisfactory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure about the ten years?\" Budge asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guaranteed. I\u0027ll just make a copy of this,\" Jeff said. They watched as he carefully made a copy of what he had written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge snatched the papers out of Jeff\u0027s hand and signed them. Zeller, Quincy, and Thompson followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge was beaming. \"A copy for us and a copy for you. Old Seymour Jarrett and Charlie Bartlett are sure going to have egg on their faces, huh, boys? I can\u0027t wait until they hear that they got screwed out of this deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Budge handed Jeff a certified check for $250,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the computer?\" Budge asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I arranged for it to be delivered here at the club at noon. I thought it only fitting that we should all be together when you receive it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge clapped him on the shoulder. \"You know, Jeff, you\u0027re a smart fellow. See you at lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the stroke of noon a messenger carrying a box appeared in the dining room of the Pilgrim, Club and was ushered to Budge\u0027s table, where he was seated with Zeller, Thompson, and Quincy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it is!\" Budge exclaimed. \"Jesus! The damned thing\u0027s even portable!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we wait for Jeff?\" Thompson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck him. This belongs to us now.\" Budge ripped the paper away from the box. Inside was a nest of straw. Carefully, almost reverently, he lifted out the object that lay in the nest. The men sat there, staring at it. It was a square frame about a foot in diameter, holding a series of wires across which were strung rows of beads. There was a long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Quincy finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Thompson said, \"It\u0027s an abacus. One of those things Orientals use to count\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" The expression on his face changed. \"Jesus! SUCABA is abacus spelled backward!\" He turned to Budge. \"Is this some kind of joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeller was sputtering. \"Low power, trouble-free, uses less power than any computer currently on the market... Stop the goddamned check!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a concerted rush to the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your certified check?\" the head bookkeeper said. \"There\u0027s nothing to worry about. Mr. Stevens cashed it this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePickens, the butler, was very sorry, indeed, but Mr. Stevens had packed and left. \"He mentioned something about an extended journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon, a frantic Budge finally managed to reach Professor Vernon Ackerman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Jeff Stevens. A charming man. Your brother-in-law, you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor, what were you and Jeff discussing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it\u0027s no secret. Jeff is eager to write a book about me. He has convinced me that the world wants to know the human being behind the scientist....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour Jarrett was reticent. \"Why do you want to know what Mr. Stevens and I discussed? Are you a rival stamp collector?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it won\u0027t do you any good to snoop around. There\u0027s only one stamp like it in existence, and Mr. Stevens has agreed to sell it to me when he acquires it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he slammed down the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBudge knew what Charlie Bartlett was going to say before the words were out. \"Jeff Stevens? Oh, yes. I collect antique cars. Jeff knows where this \u002737 Packard four-door convertible in mint condition\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was Budge who hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Budge told his partners. \"We\u0027ll get our money back and put the son of a bitch away for the rest of his life. There are laws against fraud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group\u0027s next stop was at the office of Scott Fogarty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He took us for two hundred fifty thousand dollars,\" Budge told the attorney. \"I want him put behind bars for the rest of his life. Get a warrant out for\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have the contract with you, Budge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s right here.\" He handed Fogarty the paper Jeff had written out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawyer scanned it quickly, then read it again, slowly. \"Did he forge your names to this paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, no,\" Mike Quincy said. \"We signed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you read it first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Zeller angrily said, \"Of course we read it. Do you think we\u0027re stupid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let you be the judge of that, gentlemen. You signed a contract stating that you were informed that what you were purchasing with a down payment of two hundred fifty thousand dollars was an object that had not been patented and could be completely worthless.

It was while he was establishing residence there that he had run into Conrad Morgan. Morgan had once worked for Uncle Willie. \"How would you like to do me a small favor, Jeff?\" Conrad Morgan had asked. \"There\u0027s a young lady traveling on a train from New York to St. Louis with some jewelry....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff looked out of the plane window and thought about Tracy. There was a smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tracy returned to New York, her first stop was at Conrad Morgan et Cie Jewelers. Conrad Morgan ushered Tracy into his office and closed the door. He rubbed his hands together and said, \"I was getting very worried, my dear. I waited for you in St. Louis and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t in St. Louis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What do you mean?\" His blue eyes seemed to twinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you didn\u0027t go to St. Louis. You never intended to meet me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of course I did! You have the jewels and I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent two men to take them away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a puzzled expression on Morgan\u0027s face. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At first I thought there might be a leak in your organization, but there wasn\u0027t, was there? It was you. You told me that you personally arranged for my train ticket, so you were the only one who knew the number of my compartment. I used a different name and a disguise, but your men knew exactly where to find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a look of surprise on his cherubic face. \"Are you trying to tell me that some men robbed you of the jewels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy smiled. \"I\u0027m trying to tell you that they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the surprise on Morgan\u0027s face was genuine. \"You have the jewels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Your friends were in such a big hurry to catch a plane that they left them behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan studied Tracy a moment. \"Excuse me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went through a private door, and Tracy sat down on the couch, perfectly relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad Morgan was gone for almost fifteen minutes, and when he returned, there was a look of dismay on his face. \"I\u0027m afraid a mistake has been made. A big mistake. You\u0027re a very clever young lady, Miss Whitney. You\u0027ve earned your twenty-five thousand dollars.\" He smiled admiringly. \"Give me the jewels and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifty thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to steal them twice.
