{"id":44699,"no":33,"title":"5th March","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is a March wind blowing, and the sky is filled with heavy,\n\u003cbr\u003e black moving clouds. The crows in the pine trees are making such\n\u003cbr\u003e a clamour! It\u0027s an intoxicating, exhilarating, CALLING noise. \n\u003cbr\u003e You want to close your books and be off over the hills to race with\n\u003cbr\u003e the wind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We had a paper chase last Saturday over five miles of squashy\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027cross country. The fox (composed of three girls and a bushel or so\n\u003cbr\u003e of confetti) started half an hour before the twenty-seven hunters. \n\u003cbr\u003e I was one of the twenty-seven; eight dropped by the wayside;\n\u003cbr\u003e we ended nineteen. The trail led over a hill, through a cornfield,\n\u003cbr\u003e and into a swamp where we had to leap lightly from hummock to hummock. \n\u003cbr\u003e of course half of us went in ankle deep. We kept losing the trail,\n\u003cbr\u003e and we wasted twenty-five minutes over that swamp. Then up a hill\n\u003cbr\u003e through some woods and in at a barn window! The barn doors were all\n\u003cbr\u003e locked and the window was up high and pretty small. I don\u0027t call\n\u003cbr\u003e that fair, do you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But we didn\u0027t go through; we circumnavigated the barn and picked up\n\u003cbr\u003e the trail where it issued by way of a low shed roof on to the top\n\u003cbr\u003e of a fence. The fox thought he had us there, but we fooled him. \n\u003cbr\u003e Then straight away over two miles of rolling meadow, and awfully\n\u003cbr\u003e hard to follow, for the confetti was getting sparse. The rule is\n\u003cbr\u003e that it must be at the most six feet apart, but they were the longest\n\u003cbr\u003e six feet I ever saw. Finally, after two hours of steady trotting,\n\u003cbr\u003e we tracked Monsieur Fox into the kitchen of Crystal Spring (that\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e a farm where the girls go in bob sleighs and hay wagons for chicken\n\u003cbr\u003e and waffle suppers) and we found the three foxes placidly eating milk\n\u003cbr\u003e and honey and biscuits. They hadn\u0027t thought we would get that far;\n\u003cbr\u003e they were expecting us to stick in the barn window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both sides insist that they won. I think we did, don\u0027t you? \n\u003cbr\u003e Because we caught them before they got back to the campus. \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, all nineteen of us settled like locusts over the furniture\n\u003cbr\u003e and clamoured for honey. There wasn\u0027t enough to go round, but Mrs.\n\u003cbr\u003e Crystal Spring (that\u0027s our pet name for her; she\u0027s by rights a Johnson)\n\u003cbr\u003e brought up a jar of strawberry jam and a can of maple syrup--\n\u003cbr\u003e just made last week--and three loaves of brown bread.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We didn\u0027t get back to college till half-past six--half an hour late\n\u003cbr\u003e for dinner--and we went straight in without dressing, and with\n\u003cbr\u003e perfectly unimpaired appetites! Then we all cut evening chapel,\n\u003cbr\u003e the state of our boots being enough of an excuse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I never told you about examinations. I passed everything with the\n\u003cbr\u003e utmost ease--I know the secret now, and am never going to fail again. \n\u003cbr\u003e I shan\u0027t be able to graduate with honours though, because of that\n\u003cbr\u003e beastly Latin prose and geometry Freshman year. But I don\u0027t care. \n\u003cbr\u003e Wot\u0027s the hodds so long as you\u0027re \u0027appy? (That\u0027s a quotation. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been reading the English classics.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Speaking of classics, have you ever read Hamlet? If you haven\u0027t,\n\u003cbr\u003e do it right off. It\u0027s PERFECTLY CORKING. I\u0027ve been hearing about\n\u003cbr\u003e Shakespeare all my life, but I had no idea he really wrote so well;\n\u003cbr\u003e I always suspected him of going largely on his reputation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I have a beautiful play that I invented a long time ago when I first\n\u003cbr\u003e learned to read. I put myself to sleep every night by pretending\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m the person (the most important person) in the book I\u0027m reading\n\u003cbr\u003e at the moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At present I\u0027m Ophelia--and such a sensible Ophelia! I keep\n\u003cbr\u003e Hamlet amused all the time, and pet him and scold him and make him\n\u003cbr\u003e wrap up his throat when he has a cold. I\u0027ve entirely cured him\n\u003cbr\u003e of being melancholy. The King and Queen are both dead--an accident\n\u003cbr\u003e at sea; no funeral necessary--so Hamlet and I are ruling in Denmark\n\u003cbr\u003e without any bother. We have the kingdom working beautifully. \n\u003cbr\u003e He takes care of the governing, and I look after the charities. \n\u003cbr\u003e I have just founded some first-class orphan asylums. If you\n\u003cbr\u003e or any of the other Trustees would like to visit them, I shall be\n\u003cbr\u003e pleased to show you through. I think you might find a great many\n\u003cbr\u003e helpful suggestions.\n\u003cbr\u003e I remain, sir,\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours most graciously,\n\u003cbr\u003e OPHELIA,\n\u003cbr\u003e Queen of Denmark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59755.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
