{"id":98520,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003eChapter 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two things in life that scared the ever-loving crap out of me. Waking up in the middle of the night and discovering a ghost with its transparent face shoved in mine was one of them. Not likely to occur, but still pretty damn freaky to think about. The second thing was walking into a crowded classroom late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI absolutely loathed being late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated for people to turn and stare, which they always did when you entered a classroom a minute after class started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why I had obsessively plotted the distance between my apartment in University Heights and the designated parking lot for commuter students over the weekend on Google. And I actually drove it twice on Sunday to make sure Google wasn’t leading me astray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne point two miles to be exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even left fifteen minutes early so I would arrive ten minutes before my nine-ten class began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I didn’t plan for was the mile long traffic back-up at the stop sign, because God forbid there was an actual light in the historical town, or the fact there was absolutely no parking left on campus. I had to park at the train station adjacent to the campus, wasting precious time digging up quarters for the meter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you insist on moving halfway across the country, at least stay in one of the dorms. They do have dorms there, don’t they?” My mom’s voice filtered through my thoughts as I stopped in front of the Robert Byrd Science Building, out of breath from racing up the steepest, most inconvenient hill in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I hadn’t chosen to stay in a dorm, because I knew at some point, my parents would randomly show up and they would start judging and start talking and I’d rather punt-kick myself in the face before subjecting an innocent bystander to that. Instead, I tapped into my well-earned blood money and leased a two-bedroom apartment next to campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. and Mrs. Morgansten had hated that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that had made me extremely happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I was sort of regretting my little act of rebellion, because as I hurried out of the humid heat of a late August morning and into the air-conditioned brick building, it was already eleven minutes past nine and my astronomy class was on the second floor. And, why in the hell did I choose astronomy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe because the idea of sitting through another biology class made me want to hurl? Yep. That was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRacing up the wide staircase, I barreled through the double doors and smacked right into a brick wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStumbling backward, my arms flailed like a cracked-out crossing guard. My over-packed messenger bag slipped, pulling me to one side. My hair flew it front of my face, a sheet of auburn that obscured everything as I teetered dangerously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh dear God, I was going down. There was no stopping it. Visions of broken necks danced in my head. This was going to suck so—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething strong and hard went around my waist, stopping my free fall. My bag hit the floor, spilling overpriced books and pens across the shiny floor. My pens! My glorious pens rolled everywhere. A second later I was pressed against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall was strangely warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa,” a deep voice said. “You okay, sweetheart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall was so not a wall. It was a guy. My heart stopped and for a frightening second, pressure clamped down on my chest and I couldn’t move or think. I was thrown back five years. Stuck. Couldn’t move. Air punched from my lungs in a painful rush as tingles spread up the back of my neck. Every muscle locked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” the voice softened, edged with concern. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to take a deep breath—to just breathe. I needed to breathe. Air in. Air out. I had practiced this over and over again for five years. I wasn’t fourteen anymore. I wasn’t there. I was here, halfway across the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo fingers pressed under my chin, forcing my head up. Startling, deep blue eyes framed with thick, black lashes fixed on mine. A blue so vibrant and electric, and such a stark contrast against the black pupils, I wondered if they were real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy was holding me. A guy had never held me. I didn’t count that one time, because that time didn’t count for shit, and I was pressed against him, thigh to thigh, my chest to his. Like we were dancing. My senses fried as I inhaled the light scent of cologne. Wow. It smelled good and expensive, like his…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger suddenly rushed through me, a sweet and familiar thing, pushing away the old panic and confusion. I latched onto it desperately and found my voice. “Let. Go. Of. Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue eyes immediately dropped his arm. Unprepared for the sudden loss of support, I swayed to the side, catching myself before I tripped over my bag. Breathing like I’d just ran a mile, I pushed the thick strands of hair out of my face and finally got a good look at Blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet baby Jesus, Blue Eyes was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gorgeous in all the ways that made girls do stupid things. He was tall, a good head or two taller than me and broad at the shoulders, but tapered at the waist. An athlete’s body—like a swimmer’s. Wavy black hair toppled over his forehead, brushing matching eyebrows. Broad cheekbones and wide, expressive lips completed the package created for girls to drool over. And with those sapphire-colored eyes, holy moley…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho thought a place named Shepherdstown would be hiding someone who looked like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I ran into him. Literally. Nice. “I’m sorry. I was in a hurry to get to class. I’m late and…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips tipped up on the corners as he knelt. He started gathering up my stuff and for a brief moment I felt like crying. I could feel tears building in my throat. I was really late now, like no way could I walk into that class and on the first day. Fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDipping down, I let my hair fall forward and shield my face as I started grabbing up my pens. “You don’t have to help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no problem.” He picked up a slip of paper and then glanced up. “Astronomy 101? I’m heading that way, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. For the whole semester I’d have to see the guy I nearly killed in the hallway. “You’re late,” I said lamely. “I really am sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all my books and pens back in my bag, he stood as he handed it back to me. “It’s okay.” That crooked grin spread, revealing a dimple in his left cheek, but nothing on the right side, though. “I’m used to having girls throw themselves at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, thinking I hadn’t heard the blue-eyed babe right, because surely he hadn’t said something as lame as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had and he wasn’t done. “Trying to jump on my back is new, though. Kind of liked it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling my cheeks burn, I snapped out of it. “I wasn’t trying to jump on your back or throw myself at you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t?” The lopsided grin remained. “Well, that’s a shame. If so, it would have made this the best first day of class in history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know what to say as I clutched the heavy bag to my chest. Guys hadn’t flirted with me back at home. Most of them hadn’t dared to look in my direction in high school and the very few that did, well, they hadn’t been flirting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Eyes’ gaze dropped to the slip of paper in his hand. “Avery Morgansten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart jumped. “How do you know my name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head to the side as the smile inched wider. “It’s on your schedule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” I pushed the wavy strands of hair back from my hot face. He handed my schedule back, and I took it, slipping it into my bag. A whole lot of awkward descended as I fumbled with my strap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Cameron Hamilton,” Blue Eyes said. “But everyone calls me Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam. I rolled the name around, liking it. “Thank you again, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent over and picked up a black backpack I hadn’t noticed. Several locks of dark hair fell over his forehead and as he straightened, he brushed them away. “Well, let’s make our grand entrance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet were rooted to the spot where I stood as he turned and strolled the couple of feet to the closed door to room 205. He reached for the handle, looking over his shoulder, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t do it. It didn’t have anything to do with the fact that I plowed into what was possibly the sexiest guy on campus. I couldn’t walk into the class and have everybody turn and stare. I’d had enough of being the center of attention everywhere I went for the last five years. Sweat broke out and dotted my forehead. My stomach tightened as I took a step back, away from the classroom and Cam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, brows knitted as a curious expression settled on his striking face. “You’re going in the wrong direction, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been going in the wrong direction half my life it seemed. “I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t what?” He took a step toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I bolted. I actually spun around and ran like I was in the race for the last cup of coffee in the world. As I made it to those damn double doors, I heard him call out my name, but I kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face was flaming as I hurried down the stairs, out of breath as I burst out of the science building. My legs kept moving until I sat down on a bench outside of the adjacent library. The early morning sun seemed too bright as I lifted my head and squeezed my eyes shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a way to make a first impression in a new city, new school… new life. I moved over a thousand miles to start over and I already mucked it up in a matter of minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had two options at this point: let go and move on from my disastrous attempt to attend my first class of my college career or go home, climb into bed, and pull the covers over my head. I so wanted to indulge in the second option, but that wasn’t me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf running and hiding was my MO, I would’ve never survived high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching down, I checked the wide, silver bracelet on my left wrist, making sure it was in place. I almost didn’t survive high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Dad had pitched a fit when I’d informed them of my plans to attend a university clear across the country. If it had been Harvard, Yale, or Sweet Briar, they would have been all about it then, but a non-ivy league university? For shame. They just didn’t understand. They never did. There was no way in holy hell I was going to attend the college they had gone to or enroll where half the country club back home forced their kids to attend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to go where I wouldn’t see a familiar sneer or hear the whispers that still dripped from people’s lips like acid. Where people hadn’t heard the story or whatever version of the truth that had been repeated over and over again until sometimes I questioned what really had happened Halloween night five years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them mattered here, though. No one knew me. No one suspected anything. And no one knew what the bracelet hid on summer days when a long sleeve shirt wouldn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing here had been my decision and it had been the right thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents had threatened to cut off my trust fund, which I’d found hilarious. I had my own money—money they had no control over once I turned eighteen. Money I had earned. To them, I had let them down yet again, but if I stayed in Texas or around any of those people, I would be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at the time on my cell phone, I pushed to my feet and slung my bag over my shoulder. At least I wouldn’t be late to my history class. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-1.html","bookId":2001,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM"}
