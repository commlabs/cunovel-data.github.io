You should see how lovely the campus is. \n\u003cbr\u003e I think you might come and look at it for yourself. Master Jervie\n\u003cbr\u003e dropped in again last Friday--but he chose a most unpropitious time,\n\u003cbr\u003e for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train. \n\u003cbr\u003e And where do you think we were going? To Princeton, to attend a dance\n\u003cbr\u003e and a ball game, if you please! I didn\u0027t ask you if I might go,\n\u003cbr\u003e because I had a feeling that your secretary would say no. But it\n\u003cbr\u003e was entirely regular; we had leave-of-absence from college, and Mrs.\n\u003cbr\u003e McBride chaperoned us. We had a charming time--but I shall have to\n\u003cbr\u003e omit details; they are too many and complicated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Saturday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Up before dawn! The night watchman called us--six of us--and we\n\u003cbr\u003e made coffee in a chafing dish (you never saw so many grounds!)\n\u003cbr\u003e and walked two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise. \n\u003cbr\u003e We had to scramble up the last slope! The sun almost beat us! \n\u003cbr\u003e And perhaps you think we didn\u0027t bring back appetites to breakfast!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dear me, Daddy, I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today;\n\u003cbr\u003e this page is peppered with exclamations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new\n\u003cbr\u003e cinder path in the athletic field, and the awful lesson we have in\n\u003cbr\u003e biology for tomorrow, and the new canoes on the lake, and Catherine\n\u003cbr\u003e Prentiss who has pneumonia, and Prexy\u0027s Angora kitten that strayed\n\u003cbr\u003e from home and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks\n\u003cbr\u003e until a chambermaid reported it, and about my three new dresses--\n\u003cbr\u003e white and pink and blue polka dots with a hat to match--but I am\n\u003cbr\u003e too sleepy. I am always making this an excuse, am I not? But a girls\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e college is a busy place and we do get tired by the end of the day! \n\u003cbr\u003e Particularly when the day begins at dawn.\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59775.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
