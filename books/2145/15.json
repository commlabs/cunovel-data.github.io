My mom pulled into the drive, popped out of her car, and charged toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve invited theSterlings over for dinner,\" she declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did what?\" I asked, releasing the air hose from the tire valve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I invited them over,\" she repeated,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?How?\" I stood up, shocked by my mother\u0027s news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called them up. Why is that so strange? People have been doing that for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Sterling was so delighted,\" my mom continued. \"I don\u0027t think anyone in town has invited them out socially, so I was proud to be the first one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is very nice of you... but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want us to meet them? Or is it that you don\u0027t wantthem to meetus .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you want them all to yourself.\" My mom sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything wrong with that? I just met them. Let me have some time alone before you start Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,parading them through the country club functions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if I\u0027d known you\u0027d felt so strongly... I guess I can call and cancel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t youdare! You can\u0027t; that would be rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d see it my way,\" she said, and gave me an overzealous mother- triumphs-again hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I was a kid, allMadison family meals were spent at the dinette-a small, rectangular wooden table with matching chairs. A few scratches and stains showed its age, like rings around a tree. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner; homework; and many school projects took place on this table and chairs. The dining room, however, was reserved for holiday and extended family meals. Suddenly, fancy tablecloths, sterling-silver candle holders, crystal salt and pepper shakers, linen napkins, and china flew out of the china cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have any black lace tablecloths,\" I called to my mom, who was in the kitchen preparing dinner. I searched through the cabinet drawers for Sterling-like decor. All I found in our possession was a pale crimson, a white lace, and a plastic floral one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want a black tablecloth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you even know who you are inviting over?\" I settled for a brown cloth with embroidered leaves and began setting out my grandmother\u0027s china.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t remember a time when you set the table without being asked,\" my mom said, holding a glass vase with fresh flowers. \"I\u0027ll have to invite theSterlings over more often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI positioned six plates evenly, measuring their distance by the width of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to set it too early. It might collect dust,\" she advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to make sure it\u0027s perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry and Billy Boy ran up from the basement like an incoming army. \"When\u0027s dinner?\" Billy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was aghast. \"He\u0027s not going to be here, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course; he\u0027s part of the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I only set six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then set eight. We have twelve place settings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined the conversation switching from talk of life inRomania to talkStar Trek conventions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage raced through my blood. Billy Boy knew it, too. He raised his eyebrows in victory, and he and Henry took off for his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed the nerd-mates upstairs. I found my new Purse Party messenger bag on my nightstand and knocked on his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ghouls allowed,\" he hollered to a few boyish giggles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the door ajar. I opened my wallet and flashed him a five-dollar bill. \"You\u0027ll ask to eat at Henry\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face lit up as if I\u0027d just shown him a mint condition Luke Skywalker action figure. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave my brother the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held it tightly in his hand. \"That was to ask,\" he said. \"Not to actually stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy instinct was to hit him over the head with my purse. However, he had been trained by the best, so I refrained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug back into my wallet. I had three singles left. \"This is *to stay,\"\u0027 I said, handing him a single. \"This is \u0027to eat.\u0027\" I handed him another bill. \"And this is to \u0027not come back until late.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll need money for a movie, then.\" \"And nachos,\" Henry added. \"I always eat nachos at the movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you do. Would you like money for video games, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both nodded eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a rhetorical question.\" I snarled. \"This is all I have.\" I handed him a wadded ten and twenty and lint-filled change, \"But you can have my firstborn if you spend the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I\u0027ll pass on,\" he said as I blasted out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we were going to have steaks!\" I said when I returned to the kitchen. I was missing the aroma of marinade and instead saw scentless water boiling on the stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided to make pasta instead,\" my mom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TheSterlings can\u0027t eat that. They have to eat meat. And they like it rare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why- are they animals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my black lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure we can\u0027t still get a catering company?\" I asked. \"Or at least help in serving? They\u0027re used to having a butler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are who we are-we don\u0027t change for other people. You know that. I think cheese tortellini with salad will be great. Besides, your dad is trying to cut back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t about Dad. We are hosts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they love Italian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined a bloodthirsty and starving-to-the-boneSterling family leering at my parents for their real meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t anyone in this family listen to me?\" I stormed around the kitchen and opened the fridge. I didn\u0027t expect to see blood-filled smoothies, but a girl can always hope. \"They don\u0027t like garlic, remember. No garlic bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, you\u0027ve told me a thousand times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you didn\u0027t remember I requested steaks,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll need your help with the brownies,\" my mom nudged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson served flaming pudding. Sarah Madison served microwave brownies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI zapped the dessert and realized I\u0027d spent so much time figuring out what to wear to theSterlings\u0027, I hadn\u0027t even begun to pick out what I\u0027d wear tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced upstairs and obsessed about what was the perfect attire to wear as one of theSterlings \u0027 dinner hosts. I changed outfits at least five times and, naturally, I settled on the first outfit I originally had on-a frilly black lace skirt, white bodice, black-and-red-striped stockings, and MaryJanes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was exhausted by the time the doorbell finally rang. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-15.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
