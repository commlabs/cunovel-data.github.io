I felt instantly remorseful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, I had wanted to grow up to be just like my mother. I spent hours dressing up in her clothes, stumbling around in her heels, smearing my face with her expensive creams and cosmetics. I tried to emulate her breathy voice and sensual mannerisms, certain my mother was the most gorgeous and perfect woman in the world. And her way with men, how they looked at her and catered to her … well, I’d wanted that magic touch of hers, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I had matured into her spitting image aside from the style of our hair and the color of my eyes. But that was just on the outside. Who we were as women couldn’t be more different and, sadly, that was something I’d come to take pride in. I’d stopped turning to her for advice, except when it came to clothes and decorating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was going to change. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d tried a lot of different tactics in navigating my relationship with Gideon, but I hadn’t asked for help from the one person close to me who knew what it was like to be married to prominent and powerful men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need your advice, Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words hung in the air, and then I watched comprehension widen my mother’s eyes with surprise. A moment later she was sinking back onto the sofa as if her knees had failed her. Her shock was a hard blow, telling me how completely I’d shut her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hurting inside when I took a seat on the couch opposite her. I’d learned to be careful about what I shared with my mom, doing my best to withhold information that might start discussions that drove me crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hadn’t always been that way. My stepbrother Nathan had taken my warm, easy relationship with my mother away from me, just as he’d taken my innocence. After my mom learned of the abuse, she had changed, becoming overprotective to the point of stalking and smothering me. She was supremely confident about everything in her life, except for me. With me, she was anxious and intrusive, sometimes bordering on hysterical. Over the years, I’d forced myself to skirt around the truth far too often, keeping secrets from everyone I loved just to maintain peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know how to be the kind of wife Gideon needs,” I confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders went back, her entire posture shifting to one of outrage. “Is he having an affair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” A reluctant laugh escaped me. “No one is having an affair. We wouldn’t do that to each other. We couldn’t. Stop worrying about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to wonder if my mother’s recent infidelity with my father was the true root of her concern. Did it weigh on her mind? Did she question what she had with Stanton? I didn’t know how to feel about that. I loved my dad so much, but I also believed that my stepfather was perfect for my mom in just the way she needed a husband to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gideon and I eloped a few weeks ago.” God, it felt good to put that out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at me. Once, twice. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t told Dad yet,” I went on. “But I’m going to call him today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes glistened with welling tears. “Why? God, Eva … how did we grow so far apart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t cry.” I got up and went to her, taking a seat beside her. I reached for her hands, but she pulled me into a fierce hug instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed in the familiar scent of her and felt the kind of peace only found in a mother’s arms. For a few moments, anyway. “It wasn’t planned, Mom. We went away for the weekend, and Gideon asked me if I would, and he made the arrangements …. It was spontaneous. Spur of the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back, revealing a tear-streaked face and fire in her eyes. “He married you without a prenup?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, I had to. Of course my mother would zero in on the financial details. Money had long been the driving force of her life. “There’s a prenup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva Lauren! Did you have it looked at? Or was that spontaneous, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I read every word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not an attorney! God, Eva … I raised you to be smarter than this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A six-year-old could’ve understood the terms,” I shot back, irritated by the real problem in my marriage: Gideon and I had way too many people meddling in our relationship, distracting us so that we didn’t have time to tackle the things that really needed work. “Don’t worry about the prenup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should’ve asked Richard to read it. I don’t see why you wouldn’t have. It’s so irresponsible. I just don’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw it, Monica.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both turned at the sound of my stepfather’s voice. Stanton entered the room ready for the day, looking sharp in a navy suit and yellow tie. I imagined Gideon would be much like my stepfather at the same age: physically fit, distinguished, as much an alpha male as ever. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-3.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
