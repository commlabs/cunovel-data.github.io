Gaunt Man, two tables away, is staring at her, his eyes wide and bulging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a sip from his wineglass. And another, his eyes never budging from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast to speak is the Director. He\u0027s powdered his face, buffed up his hair, polished his nails a blood red. “Dear esteemed guests, I trust that you have found the Institute— with its unsul ied reputation— to have met your high expectations to night. The food, the décor, the grandeur of this bal room— all , I do hope, to be pleasing to such regal guests as yourselves, who ordinarily wouldn\u0027t deign to travel so far for entertainment. But this is not an ordinary occasion, is it? For tomorrow night, the Heper Hunt begins!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guests, already with a few drinks in them, clink glasses, pound tabletops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To night is the night to celebrate the benevolent sovereignty of our beloved Ruler, under whose leadership the Heper Hunt was made possible. And celebrate we shal ! Without restraint! For we will have plenty of time tomorrow daytime to sleep off to night\u0027s ex-cesses!” The rasping of wrists sounds across the hal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director totters slightly; I realize that he\u0027s had a few too many drinks in him. “Now, just in case some of you are getting ideas, ideas about, hmm . . . shal we say, ‘unoffi cial y\u0027 joining this Hunt tomorrow, upon my shoulders fal s the burden of dispel ing any such hope. This building goes into lockdown mode an hour before dusk. You simply won\u0027t be able to leave this building for the duration of the Hunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swirls the wine in his glass dramatical y, gazing at it in the mercuric light. “Sometime before lockdown, the hunters wil be taken to an undisclosed, secret location. At the cusp of dusk, as early as each shal dare, they will set off into the Vast after the hepers. And so,” he says, his voice rising, “the most exciting, most scin-til ating, most extravagant, most bloody, most violent Heper Hunt ever shal begin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banquet hal erupts into a spasm of hisses and bone cracks and wineglasses smashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the speech, as the guests settle down, a string quartet assembles on the edge of the dance fl oor. The quartet plays the Baroque piece slowly and freely, a late- century arrangement. Gradual y, couples make their way to the fl oor. Halfway through the fi rst song, I catch sight of Gaunt Man rising from his chair. He has his eyes on Ashley June, and as he starts making his way toward her, his tongue sticks out, licks his lips. I push my chair back and walk swiftly toward Ashley June, outpacing Gaunt Man. She sits with her hands placed in her lap, her back straight, head up, expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I draw closer to her, her head tilts up ever so, and she looks at me from the corner of her eye. Do I detect the faintest smile touch her lips, a brief emergence of her cheek dimple? I offer her my elbow and she takes it, rising graceful y from her chair with the slightest pul on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk to dance fl oor, past Gaunt Man, left standing stiffl y and awkwardly by himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, the quartet starts another song, this one softer and more romantic in tone. There are whispers and murmurings all around, and then the other couples on the dance fl oor slide away to the edge, surrendering the spotlight to Ashley June and me, the 204 ANDREW FUKUDA hunter couple. The fl oor is ours. And suddenly, unwittingly, all eyes in the bal room are on us. A few photographers move into position, cameras at the ready. I turn to face Ashley June: a hint of dread in her eyes. Neither of us wants this attention. But it is too late for that. My shoulder squares with hers, so close I feel heat waves humming off her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite everything, there is an almost audible click of rightness. A strong pul draws us closer, as if our hearts are powerful, insistent, opposite magnets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrumming up everything I learned in school, I fi st both hands and interlace my knuckles with the knuckles of her fi sted hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at school, I dreaded dance classes, hating the proximity, fear-ing that I hadn\u0027t shaved the light hairs on my knuckles close enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with Ashley June now, I am free of fear. And free to feel: the texture of her skin, the musky proximity of her body, her breath delicately touching my neck. Her glistening green eyes look into mine. I wish I could whisper to her, but there are too many eyes upon us, the music too soft. But what I would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m so lost in the moment that I almost forget we actual y have to dance. I press my knuckles deeper into hers to let her know I\u0027m about to start. A slight push back in ac know ledg ment, and then we begin. For two people who\u0027ve never danced together, we\u0027re surprisingly adept. Our bodies move in fl uid synchrony, the distance between us constant and close. Other than a few minor brushes, our legs are harmonized and rhythmic, our feet fal ing within inches of one another, never closer. In my school dance class, dancing was never more than a bul et- point progression to fol ow, a checklist to complete in sequence. But with Ashley June it is a fl ow, a matter of simply hoisting a sail and all owing yourself to be caught up. At the end of the piece, I let her loose for the three- step spin, and her long, slim arms raise above her head like a whirling dervish. She teases out of her spin, hair spil ing seductively across her face, her green eyes puncturing me deep inside. I hear a few gasps coming from the tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” I mouth to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next piece begins. Ashley June and I separate. Now begins the obligatory dances with the wives of the offi cials, all streaming their way over to me, their high- offi cial husbands too disinterested in dancing or their wives (or both) to bother rising from their tables. It\u0027s taxing, the endless dancing and perfunctory smal talking, and after a number of dances, a fi lm of sweat starts forming on my forehead. I need to take a break, but there are simply too many women waiting in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you smel something?” asks the woman in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been dancing with her for the past minute, but it\u0027s only when she asks that question that I really see her for the fi rst time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not real y.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Smel of heper is so strong. Don\u0027t know how you can al concentrate with that odor around. So distracting. I know they say you get used to it after a while, but it\u0027s so potent it\u0027s like it\u0027s right in front of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes when there\u0027s a westerly wind blowing, the odor blows inside from the Dome,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn\u0027t seem to be much of a breeze to night,” she says, glancing out the opened windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next woman is even more direct. “I say,” she declares, “there\u0027s a heper in this hal somewhere. Smel \u0027s quite pungent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tel her about the westerly wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no,” she says, “it\u0027s so strong it\u0027s like you\u0027re the heper!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scratch my wrist; she fol ows suit. Fortunately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the song ends, she curtsies and I bow; the next woman in line is already heading over. There\u0027s a swift movement, and someone else cuts in. It\u0027s Ashley June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking in her eyes, I can tel she knows exactly what\u0027s going on and she\u0027s worried. The other woman is upset and about to complain until she realizes who it is. She backs away. Ashley and I begin to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome cameras start click-ing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, the dance lacks enjoyment. We\u0027re too conscious of the people around, too fearful of a sheen of sweat that might appear on my face any moment, of the odor I\u0027m emitting. I\u0027ve danced too hard. When the number ends, I say (loudly, so others can hear) to Ashley June that I need to use the restroom. I\u0027m not sure what good that\u0027l do me, but I can\u0027t exert any more energy dancing. Got to get away, give my body a chance to cool down. She tel s me she\u0027l wait for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m cooling down and doing my business at the urinal when somebody walks in. He stands at the urinal next to mine even though the whole row is otherwise unused. The whole restroom is empty, in fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long you going to last?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simple enough question. How long are you going to last?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s a tal and imposing man, broad- shouldered. A prissy pair of glasses sits on his nose, completely at odds with the burly brawn of his body. The tuxedo is il - fi tting, a few sizes too smal and bunched under his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to ignore him, instead focusing on hitting the target sticker in the urinal. That\u0027s what you have to hit, supposedly the lowest splash zone that gives optimum drainage. In most places, the sticker is of a fl y or bee or soccer bal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, it\u0027s a picture of the Dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Long or short?” the man says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Long time or short time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, I still don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man sniffs. “I predict short. Maybe thirty minutes. Soon as you hunters are out of sight, that\u0027s when the other hunters take you out. You and the girl both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA reporter. Probably a paparazzi hack who\u0027s snuck in using fake credentials, jonesing for an inside scoop. This is how they work: throw out an outrageous story to get a reaction, then report on the reaction. The best thing to do is ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI zip up and walk over to the paper towel dispenser by the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe zips up and pul s up next to me, hand under the dispenser, blocking my way out. The dispenser spits a short towel into his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Use the FLUNs, that\u0027s all I\u0027m tel ing you,” he says, crumpling the towel in hand. “Use them early, use them without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunters, especial y the col egiate kids, will want to take you out early in the game. Be very careful.” Not once does he look at me as he speaks, just at the dispenser as if it\u0027s a teleprompter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” I ask. And how does he know about the FLUNs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Word to the wise?” he says. “Things are not as they appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake to night, for example. Look at the glamour of this banquet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did they tel you? That it was a last minute decision to host it? Look at the food, the wine, the décor, the number of guests, and you tel me if this looks like something slapped together quickly. And think about the so- called lottery— as manipulatable a scheme as they come. Think you\u0027re here by chance? Things are not as they appear.” He puts his hand on the doorknob, about to leave. Then he turns back to me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-35.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
