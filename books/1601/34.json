What to do about Rand al’Thor? What were his plans for tomorrow? These were other questions she wanted to ask Elayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aiel needed a purpose once Rand al’Thor finished with them. That was clear from the visions. She had to find a way to give this to them. Perhaps they should return to the Three-fold Land. But . . . no. No. It tore her heart, but she had to admit that if the Aiel did so, they would be going to their graves. Their death, as a people, might not be immediate, but it would come. The changing world, with new devices and new ways of fighting, would overtake the Aiel, and the Seanchan would never leave them alone. Not with women who could channel. Not with armies full of spears that could, at any time, invade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA patrol approached. Aviendha drew some fallen brown undergrowth over herself for camouflage, then lay down flat beside a dead shrub and remained perfectly still. The guards walked two handspans from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could attack the Seanchan now, she thought. In my vision, the Aiel waited nearly a generation to attack—and that let the Seanchan strengthen their position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aiel already spoke of the Seanchan and the confrontation that must inevitably come. The Seanchan would force it, everyone whispered. Except, in her vision, years had passed with the Seanchan failing to attack. Why? What could possibly have held them back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha rose and crept across to the pathway the guards had taken. She took out her knife and rammed it down into the ground. She left it there, right beside a lantern on a pole, clearly visible even to wetlander eyes. Then she slipped back into the night, hiding near the back of the large tent that was her goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouched low and practiced her silent breathing, using the rhythm to calm herself. There were hushed, anxious voices inside the tent. Aviendha did her best not to pay attention to what they were saying. It wouldn’t be proper to eavesdrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the patrol passed again, she stood up. When they cried out, having found her dagger, she slipped around to the front of the tent. There, avoiding the attention of guards distracted by the commotion, she lifted the flap and stepped inside the tent behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people sat at a table on the far side of the very large tent, huddled around a lamp. They were so busy with their conversation that they did not see her, so she settled down near some cushions to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very hard not to listen in, now that she was so close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . must send our forces back!\" one man barked. \"The fall of the capital is a symbol, Your Majesty. A symbol! We cannot let Caemlyn go or the entire nation will collapse into chaos\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You underestimate the strength of the Andoran people\", said Elayne. She looked very much in control, very strong, her red-gold hair practically glowing in the lamplight. Several of her battle commanders stood behind her, lending authority and a sense of stability to the meeting. Aviendha was pleased to see the fire in her first-sister’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been to Caemlyn, Lord Lir\", Elayne continued. \"And I have left a small force of soldiers there to watch and give warning if the Trollocs leave the city. Our spies will use gateways to sneak through the city and find where the remaining Trollocs are herding captives, and then we can mount rescue operations if the Trollocs continue to hold the city\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the city itself!\" Lord Lir said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caemlyn is lost, Lir\", Lady Dyelin snapped. \"We’d be fools to try to mount any kind of assault now\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne nodded. \"I have held conference with the other High Seats, and they agree with my assessment. For now, the refugees who escaped are safe—I sent them on along toward Whitebridge with guards. If there are people alive within, we will try to rescue them with gateways, but I will not commit my forces to an all-out attack on Caemlyn’s walls\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking the city again would be fruitless\", Elayne said, voice hard. \"I know full well the damage that can be done to an army assaulting those walls! Andor will not collapse because of the loss of one city, no matter how important a city\". Her face was a mask, her voice as cold as good steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Trollocs will eventually leave the city\", Elayne continued. \"They gain nothing by holding it—they will starve themselves out, if nothing else. Once they leave, we can fight them—and on far fairer ground. If you wish, Lord Lir, you may visit the city yourself and see that what I say is true. The soldiers there could use the inspiration of a High Seat\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLir frowned, but nodded. \"I think I will\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go knowing my plan. We will begin sending in scouts before the night is through, trying to find pens of civilians to save, and Aviendha, what in the name of a bloody goat\u0027s left stone are you doing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha looked up from trimming her fingernails with her second knife. Bloody goat’s left stone? That was a new one. Elayne always knew the most interesting curses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three High Seats at the table jumped up, scrambling, throwing down chairs and reaching for swords. Elayne sat in her place, eyes and mouth wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a bad habit\", Aviendha admitted, slipping her knife back into her boot. \"My nails were growing long, but I should not have done it in your tent, Elayne. I am sorry. I hope I did not offend\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m not talking about your flaming nails, Aviendha\", Elayne said. \"How . . . when did you arrive? Why didn’t the guards announce you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn’t see me\", Aviendha said. \"I didn’t wish to make a fuss, and wetlanders can be touchy. I thought they might turn me away, now that you are Queen\". She smiled as she said the last part. Elayne had much honor; the way of becoming a leader among the wetlanders was different from proper ways—things could be so backward over here—but Elayne had handled herself well and obtained her throne. Aviendha couldn’t have been more proud of a spear-sister who had taken a clan chief gai’shain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn’t . \". Elayne said. Suddenly, she was smiling. \"You crept through the entire camp, to my tent at the center, and then slipped inside and sat down not five feet from me. And nobody saw\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t wish to make a fuss\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a strange way of not making a fuss\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne’s companions did not react with such calm. One of the three, young Lord Perival, gazed around him with worried eyes, as if searching for other intruders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Queen\", Lir said. \"We must punish this breach in security! I will find the men who were lax in their duty and s \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-34.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
