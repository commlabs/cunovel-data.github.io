\u0026nbsp;Her kindness was such that when she realised the blindness of her old friend she might so pity him that out of the depths of her pity she would forgive. \u0026nbsp;She would take back all the past; and now that she knew of his old love for her, would perhaps be willing to marry him. \u0026nbsp;Back flooded the old memory of her independence and her theory of sexual equality. \u0026nbsp;If out of any selfish or mistaken idea she did not hesitate to ask a man to marry her, would it be likely that when the nobler and more heroic side of her nature spoke she would hesitate to a similar act in pursuance of her self-sacrifice?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So it might be that she would either find herself once again flouted, or else married to a man she did not love.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such a catastrophe should not happen, whatever the cost to him. \u0026nbsp;He would, blind as he was, steal away in the night and take himself out of her life; this time for ever. \u0026nbsp;Better the ingratitude of an unknown man, the saving of whose life was due to her, than the long dull routine of a spoiled life, which would otherwise be her unhappy lot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When once this idea had taken root in his mind he had taken such steps as had been open to him without endangering the secrecy of his motive. \u0026nbsp;Thanks to his subtle questioning of the Doctor, he now knew that his room was close to the ground, so that he would easily drop from the window and steal away with out immediate danger of any restraining accident. \u0026nbsp;If he could once get away he would be all right. \u0026nbsp;There was a large sum to his credit in each of two London banks. \u0026nbsp;He would manage somehow to find his way to London; even if he had to walk and beg his way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He felt that now in the silence of the night the time had come. \u0026nbsp;Quietly he rose and felt his way to the door, now and again stumbling and knocking against unknown obstacles in the manner of the recently blind. \u0026nbsp;After each such noise he paused and listened. \u0026nbsp;He felt as if the very walls had ears. \u0026nbsp;When he reached the door he turned the key softly. \u0026nbsp;Then he breathed more freely. \u0026nbsp;He felt that he was at last alone and free to move without suspicion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then began a great and arduous search; one that was infinitely difficult and exasperating; and full of pathos to the sympathetic man who watched him in silence. \u0026nbsp;Mr. Hilton could not understand his movements as he felt his way about the room, opening drawers and armoires, now and again stooping down and feeling along the floor. \u0026nbsp;He did not betray his presence, however, but moved noiselessly away as the other approached. \u0026nbsp;It was a hideously real game of blindman’s-buff, with perhaps a life as the forfeit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold went all over the room, and at last sat down on the edge of his bed with a hollow suppressed groan that was full of pain. \u0026nbsp;He had found his clothes, but realised that they were now but rags. \u0026nbsp;He put on the clothes, and then for a long time sat quiet, rocking gently to and fro as one in pain, a figure of infinite woe. \u0026nbsp;At last he roused himself. \u0026nbsp;His mind was made up; the time for action had come. \u0026nbsp;He groped his way towards the window looking south. \u0026nbsp;The Doctor, who had taken off his shoes, followed him with catlike stealthiness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He easily threw open the window, for it was already partly open for ventilation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Mr. Hilton saw him sit on the rail of the balcony and begin to raise his feet, getting ready to drop over, he rushed forward and seized him. \u0026nbsp;Harold instinctively grappled with him; the habit of his Alaskan life amidst continual danger made in such a case action swift as thought. \u0026nbsp;Mr. Hilton, with the single desire to prevent him from killing himself, threw himself backward and pulled Harold with him to the stone floor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold, as he held him in a grip of iron, thundered out, forgetful in the excitement of the moment the hushed voice to which he had limited himself:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What do you want?
