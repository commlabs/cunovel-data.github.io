His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort of conduct is to the world\u0027s credit; therefore it is not well to find fault with it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom\u0027s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe\u0027s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that? Since Tom\u0027s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer\u0027s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck\u0027s confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDaily Muff Potter\u0027s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun Joe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he \"found a clew.\" But you can\u0027t hang a \"clew\" for murder, and so after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3276.html","bookId":586,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM"}
