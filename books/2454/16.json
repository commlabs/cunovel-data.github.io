He struggled to orient himself as the two of them spun across the bay with nothing to push off of and nothing to arrest their flight. They were in the middle of the room with no cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blast had hurled Kelly five meters through the air and into the side of a packing crate, where he was floating now, one magnetic boot connected to the side of the container, the other struggling to connect with the deck. Amos had been blown down, and lay flat on the floor, his lower leg stuck out at an impossible angle. Alex crouched at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden craned his neck, looking toward the attackers. There was the boarder with the grenade launcher who had blasted Kelly, lining up on them for the killing shot. We\u0027re dead, Holden thought. Naomi made an obscene gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the grenade launcher shuddered and dissolved in a spray of blood and small detonations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get to the ship!\" Gomez screamed from the radio. His voice was grating and high, half shrieking pain and half battle ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden pulled the tether line off Naomi\u0027s suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you...?\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me,\" he said, then put his feet into her stomach and shoved off, hard. He hit the deck while she spun toward the ceiling. He kicked on his boot mags and then yanked the tether to pull her down to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room strobed with sustained machine gun fire. Holden said, \"Stay low,\" and ran as quickly as his magnetic boots would allow toward Alex and Amos. The mechanic moved his limbs feebly, so he was still alive. Holden realized he still had the end of Naomi\u0027s tether in his hand, so he clipped it on to a loop on his suit. No more getting separated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden lifted Amos off the deck, then checked the inertia. The mechanic grunted and muttered something obscene. Holden attached Amos\u0027 tether to his suit too. He\u0027d carry the whole crew if that was what it took. Without saying a word, Alex clipped his tether to Holden and gave him a weary thumbs-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was... I mean, fuck,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jim,\" Naomi said. \"Look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden followed her gaze. Kelly was staggering toward them. His armor was visibly crushed on the left side of his torso, and hydraulic fluid leaked from his suit into a trail of droplets floating behind him, but he was moving - toward the frigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Holden said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five of them moved as a group to the ship, the air around them filled with pieces of packing crates blown apart by the ongoing battle. A wasp stung Holden\u0027s arm, and his suit\u0027s head-up display informed him that it had sealed a minor breach. He felt something warm trickle down his bicep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGomez shouted like a madman over the radio as he dashed around the outer edge of the bay, firing wildly. The return fire was constant. Holden saw the marine hit again and again, small explosions and ablative clouds coming off his suit until Holden could hardly believe that there could be anything inside it still living. But Gomez kept the enemy\u0027s attention, and Holden and the crew were able to limp up to the half cover of the corvette\u0027s airlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly pulled a small metal card from a pocket on his armor. A swipe of the card opened the outer door, and Holden pulled Amos\u0027 floating body inside. Naomi, Alex, and the wounded marine came in after, staring at each other in shocked disbelief as the airlock cycled and the inner doors opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe we... \" Alex said; then his voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk about it later,\" Kelly barked. \"Alex Kamal, you served on MCRN ships. Can you fly this thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, El Tee,\" Alex replied, then visibly straightened. \"Why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our other pilot\u0027s outside getting killed. Take this,\" Kelly said, handing him the metal card. \"The rest of you, get strapped in. We\u0027ve lost a lot of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp close, the damage to Kelly\u0027s armor was even more apparent. He had to have severe injuries to his chest. And not all the liquid coming out of the suit was hydraulic fluid. There was definitely blood as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me help you,\" Holden said, reaching for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me,\" Kelly said, with an anger that took Holden by surprise. \"You get strapped in, and you shut the fuck up. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden didn\u0027t argue. He unhooked the tethers from his suit and helped Naomi maneuver Amos to the crash couches and strap him in. Kelly stayed on the deck above, but his voice came over the ship\u0027s comm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Kamal, are we ready to fly?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that, El Tee. The reactor was already hot when we got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tachi was the ready standby. That\u0027s why we\u0027re taking her. Now go. As soon as we clear the hangar, full throttle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGravity returned in tiny bursts at random directions as Alex lifted the ship off the deck and spun it toward the hangar door. Holden finished putting on his straps and checked to see that Naomi and Amos were squared away. The mechanic was moaning and holding on to the edge of the couch with a death grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still with us, Amos?\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fan-fucking-tastic, Cap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit, I can see Gomez,\" Alex said over the comm. \"He\u0027s down. Aw, you goddammed bastards! They\u0027re shootin\u0027 him while he\u0027s down! Son of a bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship stopped moving, and Alex said in a quiet voice, \"Suck on this, asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship vibrated for half a second, then paused before continuing toward the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Point defense cannons?\" Holden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summary roadside justice,\" Alex grunted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden was imagining what several hundred rounds of Teflon-coated tungsten steel going five thousand meters per second would do to human bodies when Alex threw down the throttle and a roomful of elephants swan dived onto his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden woke in zero g. His eye sockets and testicles ached, so they\u0027d been at high thrust for a while. The wall terminal next to him said it had been almost half an hour. Naomi was moving in her couch, but Amos was unconscious, and blood was coming out of a hole in his suit at an alarming rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naomi, check Amos,\" Holden croaked, his throat aching with the effort. \"Alex, report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Donnie went up behind us, Cap. Guess the marines didn\u0027t hold. She\u0027s gone,\" Alex said in a subdued voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The six attacking ships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen any sign of them since the explosion. I\u0027d guess they\u0027re toast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden nodded to himself. Summary roadside justice, indeed. Boarding a ship was one of the riskiest maneuvers in naval combat. It was basically a race between the boarders rushing to the engine room and the collective will of those who had their fingers on the self-destruct button. After even one look at Captain Yao, Holden could have told them who\u0027d lose that race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill. Someone had thought it was worth the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden pulled his straps off and floated over to Amos. Naomi had opened an emergency kit and was cutting the mechanic\u0027s suit off with a pair of heavy scissors. The hole had been punched out by a jagged end of Amos\u0027 broken tibia when the suit had pushed against it at twelve g.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d finished cutting the suit away, Naomi blanched at the mass of blood and gore that Amos\u0027 lower leg had turned into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do?\" Holden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi just stared at him, then barked out a harsh laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you - \" Holden started. She talked right over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he were made of metal, I\u0027d just hammer him straight and then weld everything into place,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he isn\u0027t made out of ship parts,\" she continued, her voice rising into a yell, \"so why are you asking me what to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden held up his hands in a placating gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, got it. Let\u0027s just stop the bleeding for now, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Alex gets killed, are you going to ask me to fly the ship too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden started to answer and then stopped. She was right. Whenever he didn\u0027t know what to do, he handed off to Naomi. He\u0027d been doing it for years. She was smart, capable, usually unflappable. She\u0027d become a crutch, and she\u0027d been through all the same trauma he had. If he didn\u0027t start paying attention, he\u0027d break her, and he needed not to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. I\u0027ll take care of Amos,\" he said. \"You go up and check on Kelly. I\u0027ll be there in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi stared at him until her breathing slowed, then said, \"Okay,\" and headed to the crew ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden sprayed Amos\u0027 leg with coagulant booster and wrapped it in gauze from the first aid kit. Then he called up the ship\u0027s database on the wall terminal and did a search on compound fractures. He was reading it with growing dismay when Naomi called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly\u0027s dead,\" she said, her voice flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0027s stomach dropped, and he gave himself three breaths to get the panic out of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ll need your help setting this bone. Come on back down. Alex? Give me half a g of thrust while we work on Amos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any particular direction, Cap?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care, just give me half a g and stay off the radio till I say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi dropped back down the ladder well as the gravity started to come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like every rib on the left side of Kelly\u0027s body was broken,\" she said. \"Thrust g probably punctured all his organs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had to know that was going to happen,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easy to make fun of the marines when they weren\u0027t listening. In Holden\u0027s navy days, making fun of jarheads was as natural as cussing. But four marines had died getting him off the Donnager, and three of them had made a conscious decision to do so. Holden promised himself that he\u0027d never make fun of them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to pull the bone straight before we set it. Hold him still, and I\u0027ll pull on his foot. Let me know when the bone has retracted and lined up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi started to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re not a doctor. Just best guess,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the most horrible things Holden had ever done. Amos woke up screaming during the procedure. He had to pull the leg out twice, because the first time the bones didn\u0027t line up, and when he let go, the jagged end of the tibia popped back out the hole in a spray of blood. Fortunately, Amos passed out after that and they were able to make the second attempt without the screaming. It seemed to work. Holden sprayed the wound down with antiseptics and coagulants. He stapled the hole closed and slapped a growth-stimulating bandage over it, then finished up with a quick-form air-cast and an antibiotic patch on the mechanic\u0027s thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward he collapsed onto the deck and gave in to the shakes. Naomi climbed into her couch and sobbed. It was the first time Holden had ever seen her cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden, Alex, and Naomi floated in a loose triangle around the crash couch where Lieutenant Kelly\u0027s body lay. Below, Amos was in a heavily sedated sleep. The Tachi drifted through space toward no particular destination. For the first time in a long time, no one followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden knew the other two were waiting for him. Waiting to hear how he was going to save them. They looked at him expectantly. He tried to appear calm and thoughtful. Inside, he panicked. He had no idea where to go. No idea what to do. Ever since they\u0027d found the Scopuli, everywhere that should have been safe had turned into a death trap. The Canterbury, the Donnager. Holden was terrified of going anywhere, for fear that it would be blown up moments later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo something, a mentor of a decade earlier said to his young officers. It doesn\u0027t have to be right, it just has to be something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is going to investigate what happened to the Donnager,\" Holden said. \"Martian ships are speeding to that spot as we speak. They\u0027ll already know the Tachi got away, because our transponder is blabbing our survival to the solar system at large.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No it ain\u0027t,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain that, Mr. Kamal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a torpedo bomber. You think they want a nice transponder signal to lock on to when they\u0027re makin\u0027 runs on an enemy capital ship? Naw, there\u0027s a handy switch up in the cockpit that says \u0027transponder off.\u0027 I flipped it before we flew out. We\u0027re just another moving object out of a million like us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden was silent for two long breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, that may be the single greatest thing anyone has ever done, in the history of the universe,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can\u0027t land, Jim,\" Naomi said. \"One, no port is going to let a ship with no transponder signal anywhere near them, and two, as soon as they make us out visually, the fact that we\u0027re a Martian warship will be hard to hide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep, that\u0027s the downside,\" Alex agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred Johnson,\" Holden said, \"gave us the network address to get in touch with him. I\u0027m thinking that the OPA might be the one group that would let us land our stolen Martian warship somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t stolen,\" Alex said. \"It\u0027s legitimate salvage now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you make that argument to the MCRN if they catch us, but let\u0027s try and make sure they don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, we just wait here till Colonel Johnson gets back to us?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wait. You two prep Lieutenant Kelly for burial. Alex, you were MCRN. You know the traditions. Do it with full honors and record it in the log. He died to get us off that ship, and we\u0027re going to accord him every respect. As soon as we land anywhere, we\u0027ll bounce the full record to MCRN command so they can do it officially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded. \"We\u0027ll do it right, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred Johnson replied to his message so fast that Holden wondered if he\u0027d been sitting at his terminal waiting for it. Johnson\u0027s message consisted only of coordinates and the word tightbeam. Holden aimed the laser array at the specified location - it was the same one Fred had beamed his first message from - then turned on his mic and said, \"Fred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coordinates given were more than eleven light-minutes away. Holden prepared to wait twenty-two minutes for his answer. Just to have something to do, he fed the location up to the cockpit and told Alex to fly in that direction at one g as soon as they\u0027d finished with Lieutenant Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later the thrust came up and Naomi climbed the ladder. She\u0027d stripped off her vacuum suit and was wearing a red Martian jumpsuit that was half a foot too short for her and three times too big around. Her hair and face looked clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This ship has a head with a shower. Can we keep it?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We took care of him. There\u0027s a decent-sized cargo bay down by engineering. We put him there until we can find some way to send him home. I turned off the environment in there, so he\u0027ll stay preserved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out her hand and dropped a small black cube into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was in a pocket under his armor,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden held up the object. It looked like some sort of data-storage device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you find out what\u0027s on it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Give me some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Amos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood pressure\u0027s steady,\" Naomi said. \"That\u0027s got to be a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comm console beeped at them, and Holden started the playback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jim, news of the Donnager has just started hitting the net. I admit I am extremely surprised to be hearing from you,\" said Fred\u0027s voice. \"What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden paused a moment while he mentally prepared his response. Fred\u0027s suspicion was palpable, but he\u0027d sent Holden a keyword to use for exactly that reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred. While our enemies have become ubiquitous, our list of friends has grown kind of short. In fact, you\u0027re pretty much it. I am in a stolen - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A salvaged MCRN gunboat,\" Holden went on. \"I need a way to hide that fact. I need somewhere to go where they won\u0027t just shoot me down for showing up. Help me do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was half an hour before the reply came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve attached a datafile on a subchannel,\" Fred said. \"It\u0027s got your new transponder code and directions on how to install it. The code will check out in all the registries. It\u0027s legitimate. It\u0027s also got coordinates that will get you to a safe harbor. I\u0027ll meet you there. We have a lot to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New transponder code?\" Naomi said. \"How does the OPA get new transponder codes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hack the Earth-Mars Coalition\u0027s security protocols or get a mole in the registry office,\" Holden said. \"Either way, I think we\u0027re playing in the big league now.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-16.html","bookId":2454,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM"}
