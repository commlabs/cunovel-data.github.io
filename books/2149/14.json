I really need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said. He led me into the empty speech and drama classroom. A rack of clothes and boxes of shoes and accessories were stacked at the back of the room. Nash and I sat in chairs face-to-face, so closely our knees were touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s going on?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t sleep,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know - you haven\u0027t really been yourself lately. But I\u0027ve had a lot on my mind with my fight with Ivy - so I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t ask you about it earlier. How\u0027s your arm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to have a scar for sure. But the problem is I\u0027ve been having trouble sleeping. I think I\u0027m having post-traumatic stress or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you are. It\u0027s understandable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think that\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It was traumatic. It was awful for me just seeing you being attacked,\" I said truthfully. \"I\u0027m sure for you it was horrendous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just can\u0027t shake that night,\" he said with a far-off look. \"Ever since, I\u0027ve felt really odd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd? That didn\u0027t sound good. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his furrowed expression, I could tell he was worried. \"I have these bizarre dreams, and I wake up really exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreams? \"Maybe it\u0027s the medications for your bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\" he asked as if he hadn\u0027t thought of that himself. \"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should see the school nurse,\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll send me to a shrink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she send you to a shrink over dreams? We all have wild dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed his hand on top of mine. \"I dream about that night,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to hear any more. \"You\u0027ve always had a fear of wolves,\" I consoled him. \"It\u0027s only natural to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t take his hand away. \"I know if I tell you - you won\u0027t say anything to Ivy or Abby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, but you don\u0027t have to tell me. I don\u0027t think I really want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grasped my hand intently. \"I dream I\u0027m a wolf,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart plummeted to the pit of my stomach. Oh no, I thought. Not again. Not Nash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that weird?\" he asked, a bit shaken. \"Odd? Bizarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s probably just nerves,\" I said, trying to reassure him as much as I was trying to reassure myself. I wasn\u0027t about to accept the alternative - that Nash could be experiencing what Brandon had before he turned into a . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But to be safe, why don\u0027t we go to the nurse?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash took both of my hands in his. They were strong and a little rugged from playing sports. \"This feels like before,\" he said, \"when we were dating. I\u0027m not sure why I always messed it up with you. I know it sounds cliche . . . but you are the best thing that ever happened to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were so honest and caring that it really did shake me inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed nervously. I didn\u0027t know what to say. These were the best moments, when Nash\u0027s armor was removed and I could see deep down in his soul. I always sensed that he didn\u0027t share his truest thoughts or emotions with other girls - that, for some reason, he only shared his fears and dreams with me. It was something I wished he would have confessed and realized when we were dating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now wasn\u0027t the time to consider his romantic feelings for me. I had to get him to the nurse to see if his dreams and strange feelings might just be the result of an infection from the wolf bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse didn\u0027t find anything out of the ordinary with Nash and sent him back to class. I was relieved, but only slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, when Brandon and I were alone on the hilltop, I shared Nash\u0027s confession with him. \"Nash told me he\u0027s been having strange dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About you? I see how he is trying to make his comeback with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s worse than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could be worse than that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He dreams he\u0027s a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think . . .\" Brandon looked concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not possible. You are related to the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf, Nash isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing. Just bad dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be awesome,\" I said. \"But I just wanted you to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you told me. There\u0027s something I want you to know, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got word from my dad today,\" Brandon said enthusiastically. \"He told me he\u0027s getting close to an antidote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding!\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t it be great if he had something for me before the next full moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my head against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny,\" he said. \"I think I might miss it. There is some part of me that seems to crave those nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it\u0027s in your blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the way you look under the full moonlight. It\u0027s extraordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you don\u0027t mind my saying, I think I\u0027d miss it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in and kissed me. There was a tiny part of me that hoped Dr. Maddox took his time with the cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon and I took our school relationship slowly. Though Ivy and Abby knew about Brandon, we were still concerned not to go public until his condition was cured. The vandalism stopped, but the teasing didn\u0027t. We heard \"Wolfie,\" \"Wolfman,\" and \"Werewolf\" muttered under Eastside students\u0027 breath as we walked down the halls, and I didn\u0027t want it to become worse if they found out the truth. I wasn\u0027t so worried that Nash might reveal the secret, since he seemed to be preoccupied and recovering from his own trauma regarding the attack. However, I didn\u0027t want to make life even worse for Brandon. An Eastsider dating a Westsider would be major news in our school, and though I didn\u0027t want to hide it anymore, I knew for Brandon\u0027s sake that we had to wait for the cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash continued to show up to class restless and irritable. But as the days wore on, he became increasingly interested in me. Even when I told him I only wanted his friendship, he didn\u0027t waver in his attention. Nash didn\u0027t use the threat of revealing Brandon\u0027s secret as an attempt to win me back, but rather this time he tried chivalrous and charismatic actions. He was more charming to me than he ever had been. And though Nash opened doors for me, texted and called me, and mostly ignored every other girl who came his way, it didn\u0027t change my feelings. I had one heart, and it was meant for Brandon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-14.html","bookId":2149,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM"}
