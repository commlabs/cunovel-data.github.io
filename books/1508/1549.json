In the 33 Heavens, because humanity had devolved in the past, their status wasn’t too high in the Asura Road. If they went to some places it was likely they would be looked down upon and excluded by others. But in the Asura Road, strength stood above all. If one’s talent reached a certain boundary then regardless of whether they were human or some other race they would be respected all the same.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe city guard suspected that Lin Ming was the successor of some great influence; he naturally couldn’t offend such a person.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian obtained the qualifications to enter the city, Yue Liuxing looked at them curiously.

However, Yue Liuxing and Yue Qifeng were far too young and although they were proud of their talents in the divine runic arts, their actual combat strengths were somewhat lacking.

Or, it was more accurate to say that these records had already been lost.

But, these methods were mostly focused on raising the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone, and in terms of type, they were far closer to the saint race. There was a great difference between the Asura Sutra First Volume and the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace that humanity cultivated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMissing cultivation methods was one part, and pills and resources were another.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the essence gathering system aspect, Lin Ming didn’t have too high a need for pills.

And to the relatively minor person that Lin Ming was back then, every Heaven Opening Pill was extremely precious. In the past, the Martial House Master of the Seven Profound Martial House, Qin Ziya, had been stranded at the peak Houtian realm for over 20 years, unable to break into the Xiantian realm because he didn’t have a Heaven Opening Pill. That was how precious they were!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTempering Marrow was divided into percentages, and the closer one reached to 100%, the more difficult it would become to continue. Lin Ming finally had to rely on the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal and only then was he able to forcefully lift his Tempering Marrow boundary to 60-70%. Finally, he had relied on the Nirvana Dragon Root he obtained in the Demon Emperor Palace to bring his Tempering Marrow to perfection.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFollowing that, when he opened the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, each gate was more difficult than the last. In cultivating the body transformation technique, Lin Ming had spent a massive amount of heavenly materials. Each heavenly material that Lin Ming used for his breakthroughs possessed a shocking value for that relative cultivation level, enough that martial artists several boundaries higher would be willing to engage in life or death battles for them!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFinally, when Lin Ming broke through the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, that was also because he had accumulated resources to the peak. Not only did he have the support of the Grandmist Spirit Bead essence and the sealed energy from the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone, he also needed Xiao Moxian’s primordial yin blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith these three incomparably precious treasures together, only then did he accomplish a miracle and complete his breakthrough of the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace.

Thinking about it, he felt a bit powerless and frustrated.

However, whether it was the divine runic arts or alchemy, it wasn’t something that could be learnt in one day. One had to study from the very start in order to be successful. Even though Lin Ming’s perception was high, it would still be difficult for him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming could only take a step back and consider befriending some high rank divine runic masters and alchemists of Divine Rune City.

One didn’t need to be a genius to know that all grandmaster level characters had long since joined great influences where they were worshipped and treated as living buddhas. Wanting to ask them for any sort of help without enough rewards was an impossible matter. And for the current Lin Ming, besides the Magic Cube, Primordius Gate, Primordius Heavenly Palace, and Black Dragon Egg, there was nothing he possessed which would be able to tempt these grandmasters.
