She pulled a bit of hard-boiled butterscotch from her pocket, and sent up a silent thanks to the boys of Saint Machar — because of them, she never left the house without a sweet tucked away in her skirts. She mimicked eating, and he took it hesitantly, sticking the very tip of his tongue out to test it. A sudden smile split his face, white teeth glowing against dark skin. She fought the urge to hug him to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy nodded to the bow, and she wondered what he thought her purpose there was. She peered into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he send her to the front of the ship? It was where the younger boys had been held, in the forecastle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the men had been imprisoned aft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood. She needed to find them, free them, and somehow trundle them all down the rope ladder and to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fingered the hairpins studded throughout her low bun. It\u0027d been years since she\u0027d picked a lock — thirteen to be precise, when last she\u0027d seen the MacAlpin boys, and they\u0027d all played a trick on the maid — but she\u0027d simply have to try her best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac. Her heart fell. She truly did need his help, needed him. His glaring absence made her feel lonely and uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard\u0027s cough broke the silence and shattered her reverie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook out her skirts. She may not have Cormac, but she did have herself, and she needed to pick a direction and move quickly. The watchman leaned on the rail smoking a cheroot, and she imagined she had but a minute or two to find her way to the prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie began to tiptoe aft, praying the men were still shackled there. But the boy grunted and grabbed her arm. Again he nodded to the bow. Had Jack moved the prisoners?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, she headed where he directed, thinking it just as well. Though she hated placing the guard at her back, it was probably best to put some distance between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange, hulking shapes loomed on deck, and she slunk along in their shadows, grateful for the general creaking of timber that concealed her approach. Finally, the sound of voices came to her from below. She slowed her step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized Jack\u0027s voice and scowled. He\u0027d apparendy survived whatever damage Cormac had done to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard it. A word cut through the night, so peculiar and out of place, it stood out from the conversation. And yet it was absolutely familiar to her ears. Botanicals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swayed, catching herself before she collapsed. It was her uncle Humphrey speaking. Her heart began to kick again, her chest sore from the fitful pounding. Terrified, she edged closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore words filtered up to her, odd words. Soil… propagate… the cane…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d captured her uncle. The bailie had been at his house earlier. Had he taken him captive? But why? Surely not for his knowledge of gardening? She crept closer, keeping to the darkest areas in the center of the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s voice rang out again, posing sharp questions to the old man. Anger erupted in her like hot lava, searing all impulse away and then solidifying, leaving Marjorie\u0027s will hardened and nerves stilled. Humphrey was the only family member left to her — she wouldn\u0027t stand idly by as somebody harmed him. Hands fisted in her skirts, she strode to the forecastle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she halted abruptly. She\u0027d be a fool to go any farther empty-handed. Her eyes skittered along the deck, making sense of details in the darkness. There were pulleys and poles, and a variety of wooden trunks — but nothing that would serve as a weapon. She eyed mysterious metal prongs and cleats, but they were all bolted down. There were also ropes, so many ropes, skeins of it all around. It draped overhead, lay coiled on deck, and dangled from the railing in heavy loops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered an intricate ship\u0027s model Humphrey had once constructed. Humphrey. Her heart clenched, and she willed herself to be brave for him. Her eyes went to the railing, and the wooden pins around which the rope was looped. Belaying pins, her uncle had told her. They rested like pegs in holes along the rail. Holding her breath, she grabbed one, jiggled, and pulled it free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was smooth and solid, the length of her forearm, like a rolling pin from the kitchen. Although she\u0027d likely prove worthless at wielding the thing, it was sound enough for a weapon, and the heft of it gave her confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindful of her step, she tiptoed to the forecastle entry, which was no more than a dark archway near the bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ducked in, stopping on a shallow landing, where a ladder led down a narrow shaft to the deck below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen\u0027s voices echoed up to her, and she could clearly discern distinct words and speakers now. “Cormac MacAlpin,” a strange man growled. “Or is it Lord Brodie? Why are you here?” She drew in a sharp breath. Cormac?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he below? Why would he be with the smugglers? Was he a party to their misdeeds? But surely not — it was Cormac. She had to believe that, no matter what had come to pass, she knew him. She knew Cormac\u0027s goodness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The question is, why are you here?” Cormac retorted, his voice hostile and ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac. He was there. There was a tingling rush through her chest, like the blood returning to her veins. She\u0027d never heard a sweeter sound than the angry words he\u0027d just spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t alone. Even now, he was there and trying to save Humphrey. Cormac had told her he wouldn\u0027t help her, yet there he was, doing his all for her and her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d lied to her when he said he wouldn\u0027t help. The blasted man had simply been trying to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, blast the blasted man, she\u0027d help him. Tucking the wooden pin in her skirts, she squatted down, gingerly venturing onto the top rung of the ladder. She wasn\u0027t such a fool to think she could drop into a meeting of smugglers and kidnappers and save the day, so breathing as shallowly as she could, she carefully stepped down a few rungs and then waited, utterly still, listening to the drama unfold below. When the time was right, she\u0027d offer Cormac whatever assistance she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u0027Tis best not to ask why. The MacAlpin is an unexpected boon, but a welcome one.” Jack was laughing, and from the sound of it, he stood just by the base of the ladder. Marjorie wanted to spit down at him. “Yet another strapping man to add to the cargo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp ache cut like glass in her throat. They were discussing the prisoners, and it seemed Cormac was now one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship lurched. “Heaven help us,” she breathed, gripping the rungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps pounded like erratic drumbeats overhead. She stepped down another couple of rungs, hunched so as not to be seen from above or below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone shouted an order, and it was shouted again, repeated over and over, in a cascade down the deck, until it diminished from hearing. There was another lurch, and the sound of clanging and snapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were leaving the dock. She clenched the ladder so tighdy the blood left her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in it now. But she was in it with Cormac. Her breathing grew gradually more measured. She had faith that somehow, together, they\u0027d set all to rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s the meaning of this?” Humphrey shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy, old man,” Jack said. “I told the men if I dallied here too long, to get us under way. Looks as though you\u0027ll have a chance to demonstrate your vast expertise in situ — isn\u0027t that what you\u0027d called it, you pompous blow-hard? What say you, Aidan?” The familiar name added to the frantic alarm already trilling in the back of Marjorie\u0027s mind. “You spent years in the Indies. Shall we give these louts a taste of plantation life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what a fine flavor it is,” Aidan replied. “A bit like rum and chimney soot.” The word chimney amped her internal alarm to a fever pitch. Aidan? Surely there was more than one Aidan in the world. There\u0027d been something familiar in his voice, though, and it niggled. But surely Aidan MacAlpin hadn\u0027t returned, after so many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to know. Marjorie descended another rung. Gathering her skirts high, she squatted for a quick peek at the cabin below. It was dim, lit only by a few lanterns hung on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she saw only two men — Cormac and a man holding him at gunpoint — she knew others were there. She heard Humphrey\u0027s heavy-chested breathing, sensed Jack standing just by the base of the ladder. Terrified, she bit her lip not to make a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac\u0027s eyes flicked to her, and he mouthed a curse. His captor looked up, too, and her heart stopped in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shouldn\u0027t have looked. She should\u0027ve popped back up when she saw the gun pressed at Cormac\u0027s temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis captor cocked a brow, and his cool nonchalance was eerily familiar. Cold sweat prickled her back. He held a gun to Cormac\u0027s head, so why did he not sound an alarm at the sight of her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peered at the man, holding her breath. He stared back at her, and she felt naked in his gaze. Was this the Aidan who\u0027d spoken?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be the Aidan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breathing sped as her mind processed the impossible. She scrutinized him, straining through the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pounding heart ticked away the seconds, knowing each moment she was exposed was one too many. She compared the two of them, and though the MacAlpin twins hadn\u0027t been identical, there was an echo between these two men, in their dark hair, their height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis captor whispered in Cormac\u0027s ear, and Cormac nudged him with his shoulder. The man shouldered him back, and disbelief hit her like vertigo. She blinked hard to stop her head from reeling. It was something she\u0027d seen a thousand times — the MacAlpin boys jostling, taunting, shoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAidan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was elated, relieved, puzzled, anxious — mostly, she couldn\u0027t fathom it. Was Aidan also held captive by the smugglers? But why would he aim his gun at his own brother? Could he be a smuggler himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScampering back up the ladder, she closed her eyes, letting the revelation wash over her. Cormac would\u0027ve seen him the night he left her to investigate. That was why he hadn\u0027t wanted to sink the ship. He\u0027d seen Aidan and hadn\u0027t wanted to do anything to endanger his long-lost twin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flew open. She\u0027d known something had come to pass. He\u0027d kept silent, but she\u0027d sensed it. She shouldn\u0027t have doubted him. Cormac hadn\u0027t turned his back on her — \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-47.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
