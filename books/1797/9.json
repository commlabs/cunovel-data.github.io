She relaxed. \"A couple of years. I worked in several restaurants including the one here at the spa before I got the money and the nerve to open my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else did you work besides Sequence Springs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, here and there,\" she answered carelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here and there?\" Jonas opened one eye. \"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there was Claude\u0027s place on Martinique. I learned a lot of French techniques there. Then there was a little cafe in Spain where I picked up a few pointers on vegetables. I spent a few months studying Mexican cooking at a restaurant in Mazatlan. I learned about wine while working for a woman who owned a little hole-in-the-wall place just outside of Rio de Janeiro and I learned to wash dishes all by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled. \"I told you, you aren\u0027t the only one who\u0027s had a well-rounded education. I just don\u0027t have any formal degrees to go along with mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did your father do? Drag you around the world behind him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever since my mother died when I was eight,\" Verity confirmed. \"Sequence Springs is the first real home I\u0027ve ever had. When I settled here three years ago I decided it would take an act of God or an economic disaster to uproot me. What about you, Jonas? Think you\u0027ll ever settle down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think about it much,\" he said, his voice becoming surprisingly rough without any warning. His eyes opened and he looked directly at her. \"I take it you didn\u0027t go to college?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity gave him a wry glance. \"Dad didn\u0027t think much of the formal education process. He thought he could do a better job of educating me himself. You want to know the truth? I don\u0027t even have a high school diploma, let alone a college degree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a quizzical look. \"Does that bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity shrugged. \"No, not really. I could have gotten my GED, I suppose, and applied to college, but the truth is, by the time that occurred to me I had already decided to open a restaurant and I didn\u0027t need any formal degrees for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know something? You\u0027re one of the more interesting employers I\u0027ve had in the past few years, Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take that as a compliment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027s leg idly brushed against Verity\u0027s in the water and she felt a tiny thrill along her nerve endings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another swallow of beer and discreetly moved her leg out of the way. The last thing she wanted to do was give the hired help any ideas, she told herself. Then her sense of humor took hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of seducing her dishwasher was unexpectedly intriguing. It was also amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the smile?\" Jonas asked. \"Think of something funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity shook her head quickly. \"No. I was just relaxing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The restaurant business is hard on the feet.\" Jonas reached beneath the water and pulled Verity\u0027s foot onto his thigh before she realized his intention. He began a deep, slow massage of her calf and the sole of her foot. \"In fact, I\u0027ve been meaning to tell you that you work too hard. I think you need a little fattening up, too. You\u0027re eating too much vegetarian health food for your own good. You need to introduce a little grease into your diet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bristled. \"My diet is a heck of a lot healthier than yours. Do you know how much pure animal fat was in that hamburger I saw you eating this afternoon? Have you any idea what that stuff does to your insides?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I have a feeling that if I let you, you\u0027ll tell me exactly what it does, and I don\u0027t think I want to hear it tonight. I\u0027m trying to unwind from a hard day\u0027s work. So are you. Relax, boss lady.\" His thumbs probed deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity started to argue but suddenly she was overwhelmed by the wonderful sensations Jonas was creating with his hands. She couldn\u0027t remember anything ever feeling as wonderful as his touch on the sore muscles of her calf. \"Jonas...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heavy leg settled across her lap. \"You do me while I do you. Fair enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of pure physical pleasure that had its origin in her toes moved through Verity. There was nothing wrong with a massage. It was very therapeutic. Heaven knew they had both worked hard during the weekend. So why did his question have such sensual overtones? she wondered. Or was her mind simply running wild?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentatively she stroked his hairy leg, seeking the feel of the long muscles there. When she had one shaped beneath her palms she carefully squeezed her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes, that\u0027s it.\" Jonas\u0027s hand tightened for an instant around Verity\u0027s foot in a grip that was just short of painful. \"Christ, that feels good, boss lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure if he was referring to the way she was stroking his leg or the way her foot felt to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity intensified her grip and deepened the massage. For a few moments they worked in silence, eventually switching feet. Verity was beginning to feel more relaxed than she had in a long while. Her eyes half-closed as she concentrated dreamily on the innocently sensual sensations of giving and getting a massage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you wouldn\u0027t call me boss lady,\" she finally said after a while. She took one hand off his leg to help herself to another swallow of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of silence while Jonas did the same and then he said softly, \"I don\u0027t really think of you as a boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to know the truth? I think of you as a full-fledged tyrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no idea I\u0027d made such an impact on you.\" Verity squeezed his calf a bit harder than she had intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas winced. \"I can just see you back in the Renaissance presiding over a Medici court salon. You\u0027d have the courtiers falling all over themselves trying to please you. They\u0027d call you their flame-haired lady tyrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity thought about that for a moment. \"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but weren\u0027t most Renaissance court salons run by professional courtesans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas chuckled. \"You did pick up a well-rounded education, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father didn\u0027t believe in the formal educational process but he insisted I do one hell of a lot of reading,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity said reminiscently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right about some of the ladies who ran the salons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink you\u0027d like the life of a courtesan?\" His eyes glittered teasingly between narrowed lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That career path has lost some of its luster these days, but it would certainly have been a viable option for a woman back in the sixteenth century. It was either that or the convent. Either avenue gave a smart, savvy woman a path to power, and either choice sounds better than the only other job available.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-9.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
