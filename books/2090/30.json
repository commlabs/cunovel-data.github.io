Lord knew what tomorrow might bring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, I was disappointed. Where once sex with no strings hadn\u0027t sounded bad, now it no longer sounded good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted my tangled hair from my neck and pressed his lips to the sensitive skin at the curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For years I thought you were dead.

Everything I knew of sex and love, I\u0027d learned from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted him now as I\u0027d wanted him then, loved him the same, if not more. Could I hope again for a future only to have it snatched away? Was it better to dream the impossible than never to dream at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of what tomorrow brought, we had tonight. I planned to make the most of every opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooking my ankle around his, I tumbled us onto the bed. We fell in a heap of limbs and new clothes with me on top. Nic laughed, and I stared down into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" His laughter faded, leaving a puzzled smile in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t heard you laugh like that since - \" I broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stanford?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t laugh much anymore.

But when I tried to deepen the kiss, he wouldn\u0027t let me, instead making the embrace more tranquil than arousing, more gentle than passionate. That single kiss, which went on and on, moved me more than the sex ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward slammed the door, and I scrambled off Nic as if I were fifteen years old instead of twenty-nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appeared in the doorway, lifting his brows at the sight of my tangled hair and twisted sweater. I smelled smoke - he had taken care of the body in the woods -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then his gaze went past me to Nic, and he grimaced before turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kitchen,\" Edward snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to see what had annoyed him this time and had to hide a smirk. Nic might have been kissing me gently, but he still had a hard-on that was clearly visible beneath his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he thinks he\u0027s going to force me out of town again,\" Nic said, \"I\u0027m going to kick his bony ass, then shoot him. With silver, just to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to laugh, then I choked as a thought hit me, sending a nasty chill from head to toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" I said, and followed Edward into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d set a package on the table - my research, thank goodness. One less thing to worry about. On to the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the room, hesitating as I neared him. Could I shoot Edward? He could certainly shoot me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched his arm. He jerked back, nearly knocking over a chair in his haste to get away. But it was enough. I glanced at Nic, who had followed despite my orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen our eyes met, I shook my head and he lowered his hand from his weapon. I took comfort from the knowledge that he would have shot Edward if I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought I was bitten?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Better safe than sorry. You have been acting odd lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you tell?\" Nic muttered, earning a glare from Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would shoot myself if I was infected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well if you were bitten you wouldn\u0027t be you anymore,\" I said, \"you\u0027d be them.

And suddenly, I didn\u0027t really care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting back to our present troubles,\" Edward continued briskly. \"I did not know this Basil Moore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you know him?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be a traitor, to know some of the things our enemies now do, the culprit would have had to be one of us once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rogue agent,\" I supplied. \"Once J��ger-Suchers, until fired by Edward for inappropriate behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of nutcase do you have to be to get ousted from a monster-hunting society?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have rules.\" Edward sniffed. \"If they are not followed, out you go. If you are lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlucky people disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany former J-S agents were adrenaline junkies. They couldn\u0027t give up the danger, or hold down a regular job, so they went hunting on their own. After searching out and destroying monsters most of mankind didn\u0027t even know about, it was kind of hard to adjust to life as a librarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But since Basil was not one of us,\" Edward reiterated, \"he could not be a traitor, though he may have bought information from one who is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now we\u0027ll never know, because someone killed him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A werewolf, not a someone,\" Edward pointed out. \"Now tell me what you have learned about witchie wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia\u0027s book lay on the table. Nic picked it up and started paging through as I filled Edward in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you spoken with Jessie\u0027s lover?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you call him that?

He pulled out an electronic device I\u0027d never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaker phone?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of a kind. This is a prototype. Not only can those we call hear all of us, but it magnifies the other line so we can hear them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was provided with the latest technology from the U.S. government - usually double-nought spy stuff like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be easier to discuss the case, ja?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Ja,\" I said. \"I mean yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward hooked the contraption to the phone line, then dialed Jessie\u0027s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This had better be good,\" she answered, the slur in her voice making me glance at my watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emidnight. Why was she asleep?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to have a conference,\" Edward said. \"Set the phone on a flat surface so we might hear both you and your - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke off, glanced at me, scowled and muttered, \"Cadotte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Cadotte? Well, he is kind of mine.\" The phone clunked once. \u0027Okay. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How up-to-date are they?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolf in human form biting the dead, disappearing bodies, invisible ghost wolves - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa!\" Jessie interrupted. \"I never heard anything about ghost wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rustle of sheets preceded Will\u0027s voice. \"Are you talking about witchie wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re supposed to live - well, not live exactly, exist, I guess - on the shores of Lake Huron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently they don\u0027t know that, because they\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fascinating,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off he goes,\" Jessie said. \"Computer Boy to the rescue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on, Will,\" I ordered. \"Have you ever heard of the ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Will said. \"Where did you hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a book Lydia gave us. \u0027Witchie wolves sleep in the sun until the .\u0027 Mean anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds of a computer turning on, booting up, came over the line.

Not only were my formulas and notes on a disc, but there was an emergency dose of serum, which was going to come in handy far too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pocketed the vial, just as Nic murmured, \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jessie, Will, and I asked at the same time.
