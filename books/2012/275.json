They’re letting us catch up to them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Brys and Aranict had slowed their horses to a fast trot. ‘The mounts are winded, Precious. We’re all in bad shape.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, they drew up alongside the prince and the Atri-Ceda. ‘Where’s this army, then?’ Faint demanded. ‘I thought they were camped close.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They are, Faint,’ Aranict replied. ‘They simply have no need of cookfires, or lanterns.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Faint made out a darker stain covering the low hills before them, and the dull gleam here and there of iron, or maybe reptilian eyes. Another shiver rippled through her. ‘How confident are you in these allies?’ She could see massive, elongated heads lifting now, eyes fixing upon them. She could see serrated rows of fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They are commanded by three humans, Faint, and two of them were once soldiers in the Bonehunters.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious Thimble muttered something under her breath, probably a curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAranict glanced at the young sorceress, and then over at Faint. ‘Do you share your colleague’s mistrust of Malazans, Faint?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, they tried conquering Darujhistan once. But then they turned round and crushed the Pannion Domin – and the Pannions were headed towards Darujhistan, with bad intentions.’ She shrugged. ‘I don’t see them as any better or worse than anyone else.’ Turning to Precious, she said, ‘Besides, I visited One-Eye Cat before it got conquered, and that place was a hole.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But at least it was my hole!’ Precious snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did you just say—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, be quiet, will you? You know what I meant!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prince and the Atri-Ceda said nothing and managed to hold their expressions – at least as far as Faint could discern in the heavy gloom. Darkness our saviour!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty paces ahead, at the mouth of an avenue between ranks of silent, motionless K’Chain Che’Malle stood two men and a woman. The woman knelt and lifted the shutters on an oversized lantern, bathing the area in light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the riders drew closer, Faint studied these … commanders. The men were the soldiers, clad in the uniforms of Malazan marines, and though at first Faint took them to be Falari – with that red and yellow hair – there seemed to be a strange hue to their skin, somewhere between bronze and gold, almost lit from within. The woman was a tribal of some sort. Like the Rhivi, only bigger-boned, her face broad, slightly flat, her eyes dark and glittering like obsidian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Brys dismounted, followed by Aranict and then Faint. Precious remained seated on her horse, glowering at the Malazans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sergeant Gesler,’ Brys began, and then stopped. ‘Are you certain you prefer that modest rank? As Mortal Sword to the—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Forgive me for interrupting, Commander,’ Gesler said, ‘but Stormy insists. He won’t even talk to me otherwise. Leave all the fancy titles to other people—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He got busted down for good reasons,’ Stormy cut in. ‘And he ain’t fixed none of those that I can see. In fact, he’s gotten worse. If he showed up in a recruiting line right now I’d send him to the cook staff, and if they was feeling generous they might let him scrub a few pots. As it is, though, he’s a sergeant, and I’m a corporal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Commanding seven thousand K’Chain Che’Malle,’ Aranict observed, lighting a stick of rustleaf from a small ember-box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Brys resumed, ‘Sergeant Gesler. Your message – I take it she is awake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, and she’s not particularly happy. Commander, she’s got something to say, something she needs to tell you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see. Well then, lead on, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they made their way through the camp, with Gesler out front and Stormy carrying the lantern a few paces behind, Faint found herself walking alongside the tribal woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are the Destriant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kalyth, once of the Elan. And you are one of the strangers who found the Letherii army.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Faint, of the Trygalle Trade Guild. That miserable girl riding behind us is Precious Thimble. She doesn’t like Malazans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘From her,’ Kalyth said, ‘the flavour is one of fear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With good reason,’ Precious retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s this war we can’t make any sense of,’ Faint said. ‘The Malazans fight when and where it suits them. They’re a damned empire, after all. It’s all about conquest. Expansion. They don’t fight for noble causes, generally. Even taking down the Pannions was politically expedient. So we’re finding it hard to work out what they’re up to. From all that we’ve heard, Kolanse is not worth the effort. Especially with a bunch of Forkrul Assail laying claim to it now.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-275.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
