Mila and I had walked along the beach until we were exhausted. We held hands and kissed, then held hands some more. I had walked her to her car, where we kissed yet again. But I didn\u0027t invite her to my place and she didn\u0027t invite me to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is too good to fuck up. Even an asshole like me knows that. If she wants to take it slow, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m going to do. I\u0027m not going to rush her. I have a hand for a reason and I\u0027m not afraid to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust thinking the word use makes me remember my craving, the one where I want my nose to burn and the numbness to spread through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s just habit. Because for the first time since I can remember, I don\u0027t want to be numb. Mila makes me want to feel things... with her and for her. She makes me want to be a better person simply so that I can be around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I throw my covers back and do an impetuous thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the lid off of my vial and dump every pill inside it into my toilet, flushing them down. As I watch them swirl around, I\u0027m overcome by a moment of panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck am I doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost thrust my hand into the toilet water to yank them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Mila\u0027s face appears in my head and I am calm again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m doing the right thing. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing. And I can do this. I\u0027m not a pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pad down to the kitchen and find my backup pills in the freezer, and I toss them into the garbage disposal, turning it on. I listen to it grinding up the pills, grinding away my escape from reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even dispose of my sleeping pills. Anything that can be a crutch to me, I pitch. Except for the three bottles of whiskey that I have in the kitchen. I\u0027m trying to turn over a new leaf- I haven\u0027t gone fucking insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell phone rings and I see Mila\u0027s name light up. I smile and answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, babe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is silence for a second, as though the endearment caught her off-guard, but I hear the smile in her voice when she finally answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. Just calling to say good morning. And to thank you for last night. It was really nice. I had a fantastic time. What are you doing now? Did I wake you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"No. You didn\u0027t wake me. You won\u0027t believe what I\u0027m doing, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she laughs. \"Well, are you going to tell me or are you honestly wanting me to guess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wanting you to guess,\" I tell her. \"But if you want to lack creativity, then I can just tell you. I\u0027m turning over a new leaf. I won\u0027t bore you with the details, but I think you\u0027ll notice a change around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pax, what do you mean, a new leaf? What kind of change are you talking about? Because if it\u0027s something significant, I don\u0027t want you to do it because you think I want you to. That will never work. Change only happens if you want it to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. \"You\u0027re fairly wise for such a young little thing,\" I tell her. \"But I do want to make this change. You were right last night. I\u0027ve used drugs to cover up emotions before- to block them out. Only a pussy does that. I can handle whatever life wants to throw at me. I don\u0027t need a crutch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, one, I\u0027m not much younger than you. I\u0027m twenty-three. And two, I\u0027m really happy for you, Pax. This is amazing. And I\u0027ll help you in whatever way you need. If you want, I can recommend a therapist. I used one after my parents died. He was really good with helping me deal with the grief. But I\u0027m sure he can help you with kicking this, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck that,\" I tell her automatically. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean for that to sound rude. I just meant that I\u0027m not an addict. I don\u0027t need help kicking the habit. I really don\u0027t. But thank you for the offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonger pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Mila finally answers. \"I can respect that. But let me know if I can do anything to help. I can listen if you want to talk, or try to keep you occupied, or whatever you need. In the meantime, would you like to have another date tonight? I have something in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" I ask, raising my eyebrow even though she can\u0027t see it. \"And what are you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it involves my shop and paint. Since we\u0027re getting to know each other, I thought maybe you\u0027d like to see what I like to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m intrigued now, so I tell her that and then agree to meet her at her shop at 7:00. I\u0027m supposed to bring take-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile as I head to the shower. If this is what being in a relationship is like, I think I can handle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say not to wish your life away, but that\u0027s exactly what I do all afternoon long as I wait for 7:00 p.m. to roll around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I close the shop at 6:00, I rush up to my apartment and shower, dressing in a pair of jeans that fit me just right and a soft red sweater, a gift from him. This particular sweater has a plunging neckline and I don\u0027t wear a camisole underneath. I can see the swell of my breasts as I examine myself in the mirror and a flush spreads along my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you\u0027re ridiculous,\" I tell myself as I dab on perfume. \"You\u0027re an adult, he\u0027s an adult. You can dress sexy if you want to. It doesn\u0027t make you a slut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I\u0027m talking to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 7:00, I make my way back down the stairs, pretending to be calm while I wait for Pax in my shop. He\u0027s right on time, thank God. I watch him walk up the sidewalk and quite honestly, he takes my breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, he\u0027s freshly showered again and wearing jeans and a black shirt that clings to his chest beneath his coat. His slender waist makes me ache to wrap my arms around it, so I drag my gaze up to his face. He winks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart flutters as I unlock the door and let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I say softly. He brings with him the cool winter air and his clean scent. I take a deep breath, then stretch up to kiss him on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he answers. \"Is that all you\u0027ve got for me?\" He grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, rolling my eyes. \"For now. Be patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m very patient,\" he tells me. \"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops in the middle of my shop and looks around. He\u0027s so big, but he manages to not look out of place in the midst of all the delicate furniture, easels and paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s the plan? What are we doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, first, I\u0027m going to take your coat. And then you have two choices. I can either teach you to paint and you can paint with me, or I\u0027ll paint you. You can be my model. Either way, it should be fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax stares at me thoughtfully, appearing to truly think about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m not much of an artist,\" he finally says. \"I don\u0027t even know if you could teach me, to be honest. I\u0027m just not artistically inclined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I could teach you,\" I tell him smugly. \"But if you would feel more comfortable, I\u0027d be happy to paint you and we can chat while I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been painted before,\" he announces. \"Can I choose the setting and pose and whatnot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m surprised that he would care. But I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. This is just for fun. I\u0027ll do it any way that you want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beams. \"Great! I\u0027d like to be nude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m shocked as I stare at him, but as I see the sparkle in his eyes, I know that I walked right into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a trap!\" I roll my eyes. \"You set me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs and looks very proud of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry that you\u0027re not more street-wise,\" he says, and I can tell that he\u0027s not sorry at all. \"But you already agreed to it. So, I guess you\u0027ll be painting me nude.\" He narrows his eyes. \"Why? Does that bother you? Are you worried that you won\u0027t be able to control yourself as you gaze upon my sexiness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waggles his eyebrows now and I giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027ll try hard to manage,\" I tell him. But quite honestly, it might be a feat. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027ve gotten myself into this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulp a big breath of air and glance around, trying to calm my quaking nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better take this into my studio in the back. I don\u0027t think you want to be naked in front of the windows. Or maybe you do, you exhibitionist freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, remembering that he has entire walls of windows at his house which doesn\u0027t deter him from walking around naked. Then I remember watching him get a blowjob through one of those windows and it sobers me up. My cheeks flush and Pax looks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong? Does the fact that I\u0027m a freak bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s still kidding and has no idea that I have a picture of he and Jill firmly implanted into my head. I shake my head, trying to shake the image away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I joke back. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my heel on his shocked expression and lead the way to my private studio. As I walk in, I inhale the familiar smell... of oil paint, acrylic and wood floors. I turn to Pax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I give private lessons in here and this is where I do my own work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks around appreciatively. \"It\u0027s perfect. I can see you in here, working away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points at a painting hanging on the wall, one of a woman with her head bowed. It\u0027s fairly abstract and you can\u0027t see the details of the woman\u0027s face. No one would know that it\u0027s my sister, and her head is bowed because she\u0027s crying at my parents\u0027 funeral. That particular moment imprinted on my heart and I knew I had to paint it. The painting hangs in here, in my private studio, because it\u0027s too personal to be sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that Madison?\" Pax asks curiously. I stare at him in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you possibly know that?\" I ask. \"It\u0027s so vague.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks over to examine it. \"Well, I can see that the features are delicate, like hers. Her hair is blonde and there\u0027s just something haunting and personal about it. I figured it had to be Madison. It\u0027s beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs his finger along the bottom edge of the frame, still examining it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s crying, isn\u0027t she?\" he muses. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns to me. \"You\u0027ve been hurt in life, Mila. I know that. And I swear to you, on everything that is sacred to me, that I will try not to hurt you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him as I pull out a smock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On everything that you consider sacred?\" I\u0027m trying to joke now, to pull us out of this serious conversation. I\u0027m just not in the mood for deep right now. \"What exactly do you consider sacred? Jack Daniels?\" I laugh, and he finally laughs too, allowing me to lead this conversation elsewhere. I\u0027m silently grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have you know, Miss Smarty Pants, that Jack has gotten me through some hard times. And thankfully, I\u0027m not giving him up yet. So, yes. Maybe Jack Daniels is sacred to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins at me cockily, daring me to say something. So I raise an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can drop trow now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw practically drops instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop trow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shock makes me giggle. \"Hey, you\u0027re the one who wanted a nude picture, you freak. In order for me to do that, you\u0027re going to have to drop your trousers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax regains his composure and smiles charmingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you think you can control yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unfastens his jeans and lets them drop to his ankles. He steps out of them, then his underwear follow. I fight the urge to look. He grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you know you want to,\" he teases, as he pulls off his shirt. \"Go ahead. Take a peek. You\u0027re going to have to eventually anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard as I stare at his chest. He\u0027s got a tattoo on each pec, and one on each bicep. I notice that he\u0027s also got words on his right side. All of it is perfectly show-cased by his amazingly sculpted body. Holy hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight not to look below his waist. I don\u0027t want to give him the satisfaction right now and he\u0027s certainly waiting. I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All in good time, Mr. Tate. Why don\u0027t you go up there and stand under the light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motion toward the front of my studio, a safe and respectable distance from my easel. He confidently strides naked into place. I inhale. His backside is as sculpted and perfect as his front. How is that even possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you want me?\" he asks as he stands facing me, his hands dangling at his sides. What a loaded question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but look below his waist now and am sufficiently impressed, yanking my eyes back up to find that he is staring at me in amusement. My cheeks immediately flush, hot and quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um. Why don\u0027t you turn a bit and look into the distance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wish is my command,\" he drawls, turning. The muscles of his back ripple and I stare at the words on his side. They are bold and black, scrawling across his ribcage. I read it aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go placidly against the noise and haste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that from the poem Desiderata?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and I\u0027m stunned. I must look it because he laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You think I\u0027m illiterate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocks an eyebrow and I laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s just not how I think of you. Placid. Or calm. Isn\u0027t the next line something about peace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. \"It\u0027s And remember what peace there is in silence. I almost had that inked on me, too, but decided against it. It\u0027s enough that I know. Pax means peace in Latin, you know. So it\u0027s fitting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull the canvas toward me and begin to paint his silhouette, deciding to do it in an abstract, like the painting of Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I didn\u0027t know that. That\u0027s interesting. And your tattoo is beautiful. I just don\u0027t picture it as something that you would choose. It says a lot about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax stares at me thoughtfully. \"Why? Because it\u0027s deep? I\u0027m deep. Sometimes. Although most of the time, I\u0027m just trying to block out reality. I\u0027ll give you that. But there\u0027s peace in that, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eye him, then paint the line of his butt and thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But that\u0027s not true peace. It\u0027s a false sense of peace, brought on by oblivion and denial. That\u0027s not real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up again and he seems to be considering that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might be right,\" he says quietly. \"But it\u0027s still a peace, nonetheless. It\u0027s better than nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you set the bar too low,\" I tell him. \"You need to aim higher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paint the edge of his pec, then flow downward to his rib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" he says seriously. \"With you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up and into his eyes and the intense look that I find there gives me goose bumps. His hazel eyes glitter and I can\u0027t think straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" he drawls with a grin, lightening the mood again. \"I think you\u0027re handling this much better than I expected. Being exposed to all of this sexiness is usually disarming, but you\u0027re one cool customer, Mila. I propose that we up the ante.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him hesitantly, my hand frozen above the canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m almost afraid to ask,\" I tell him. \"What do you want to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examines me as he stands tall and proud in his nudity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to be naked while you paint me. It\u0027s the least you can do to put me more at ease. I\u0027m a basket case over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do a double-take and my jaw drops open. He\u0027s the furthest I\u0027ve ever seen from a basket-case right now. He\u0027s proud of his nudity. Cocky, even.
