Never mind it could possibly turn him into a werewolf full-time; what if it didn\u0027t work at all? What did we know about the serum anyway? Even with Dr. Maddox\u0027s reassurance, the anxiety of the unknown was palpable to us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how was I supposed to make sure that Brandon was the one who took it first? It really wasn\u0027t my decision, and I felt that Brandon might not want to be cured as much as Nash. But I\u0027d made a promise, and I\u0027d have to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to hide my anxiety the next day by hanging out with Brandon at his house. But as soon as my mind became unfocused, that was the first thing my thoughts went back to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash sent me texts about how he needed me to help find him a cure - that he was feeling more agitated with the impending full moon. Brandon was obviously anxious, too, chopping wood that didn\u0027t need to be chopped and building things in his backyard that didn\u0027t need to be built. In his spare moments, I saw his mind wander, and I knew what it was contemplating: a life forever as a werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo ease our minds, I thought it might be a good idea to get insight on their lycan plight by getting more information on the whole Legend\u0027s Run folklore from the only living resource we knew - ninety-year-old Mr. Worthington. Brandon and I hadn\u0027t been to visit him in a few weeks, and I thought he might be happy to have us. And I decided bringing Nash along might help us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that day, I called Nash and convinced him to meet Brandon and me in the parking lot outside the Pine Tree Village Retirement Community. Nash knew that I had been volunteering here for some time, but when we were dating he always had an excuse not to join me. I think he felt awkward around elderly people - maybe he didn\u0027t know how to speak to them or felt sorry for them because they seemed lonely. To me, they were like anyone else, just older. And their stories and lives were that much richer for their years of experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed in first, with Brandon following me and Nash last in our pack. Brandon stood beside me, and Nash hung back in the foyer while I asked the receptionist for Mr. Worthington. Usually the friendly senior citizen was out in the lobby making small talk or taking a quick nap, but this time he wasn\u0027t in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to worry - but I only felt good when I saw him well, at his age. Every time I didn\u0027t see him made me afraid I\u0027d never see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, my concern eased as the receptionist assured me that he was just finishing a group activity. We could smell chicken baking in the kitchens. Dinner came early at Pine Tree Village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting hungry,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting sick,\" Nash said. \"I\u0027d hate to live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\" I said. \"You\u0027re being rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the old man?\" Nash said. \"I think I\u0027ve aged a few years already waiting for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash\u0027s impatience was one of the reasons I didn\u0027t totally click with him. I knew he was only hiding his fear - in this case, fear of becoming old and being alone. But Brandon was naturally caring and nurturing. He took care of his grandparents and seemed really pleased when he met Mr. Worthington and found out he was his maternal great-grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash was texting when Mr. Worthington came out from the dining room and into the lobby. The chipper senior citizen was pleasantly surprised to see me and my entourage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington was wearing a brown cardigan and khakis. He walked slowly toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Celeste, it is wonderful to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just stopped by to say hello,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington extended his hand to my boyfriend. \"Brandon,\" he said. \"It\u0027s good to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this is our friend, Nash,\" I said, introducing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nice to meet you,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"You can call me Charles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash extended his hand. \"I\u0027m pleased to meet you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your boyfriends seem to be multiplying,\" Mr. Worthington said to me with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed and tried to cover my embarrassment with a soft giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What brings you here?\" Mr. Worthington finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like to know more about the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great news,\" he said. Mr. Worthington was always eager to have an audience, and talking about the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf was one of his favorite subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, sit down.\" Mr. Worthington waited while I sat on the sofa. Then Brandon sat next to me while Nash and Mr. Worthington took their places in paisley-patterned chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like to know?\" Mr. Worthington asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve heard about the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf,\" I began. \"But we only know about the one werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" he asked eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the story you told us last time, a man was bitten by him,\" I continued. \"We\u0027d like to know if there is another werewolf. Another bloodline?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I know what you mean,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"Bloodline?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told us that your great-grandfather Worthington was rumored to have bitten another man,\" I reminded him. \"That means that maybe there was another werewolf bloodline that carried the curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes...\" Mr. Worthington said. \"That is, if you believe in such things. Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all nodded in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington perked up, pleased with his captive audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family was very close with another family. The Hamiltons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash, Brandon, and I sat up as if a ghost had just stepped in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I say something wrong?\" Mr. Worthington asked, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I replied. \"In fact, you said something right. Please, go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family - our family - \" he said, referring to Brandon, \"settled in Legend\u0027s Run at the same time as the Hamiltons did. Competition immediately came between the two families. Legend has it that it was over a girl.\" Then he paused. \"Isn\u0027t it always? Great wars are started that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington looked at us and gave us a laugh. Nash and Brandon chuckled back politely. I don\u0027t think either one of them cared for the joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Hamiltons were the ones who tried the most to banish my great-grandfather from town,\" he continued. \"It was said that Joseph Hamilton was hoping he could gain control of my grandfather\u0027s wealth and the love of his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh,\" I said. \"It sounds scandalous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might say that,\" he went on. \"But the story goes that it was the night of a full moon when Joseph Hamilton was on his way to confront my great-grandfather in the forest and met a half man, half wolf. It was said townsfolk heard his cries for miles. He didn\u0027t return that night. The next day a group of hunters discovered him lying in the woods, violently attacked and left for dead. They returned him to his family, who nursed his wounds. But during the following nights he began behaving strangely. Fierce howling came from his house at moonlight. The daylight showed his home had been ransacked, as if by a wild animal. His wife and children, fearing for their lives, fled. Townsfolk believed he\u0027d come down with a fever, and this was what caused his strange behavior. Those few who believed in the lore of the werewolf swore otherwise. The two men were forced to live out their lives as lonely and haunted creatures of the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow...\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon shook his head in awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Nash asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you want to hear?\" Mr. Worthington wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That they all live happily ever after,\" Nash said, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it more exciting and mysterious this way?\" Mr. Worthington asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Nash said. \"It\u0027s depressing and tragic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how most werewolf stories are. That\u0027s what makes them exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like that kind of excitement,\" Nash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just legend,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"Folklore that\u0027s repeated through time. Just like ghost stories told around a campfire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you believe it, don\u0027t you?\" I asked Mr. Worthington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t make sense - my great-grandfather was a werewolf?\" he asked. \"As a boy it always frightened me, and I surely believed it. However, as I grew older I dismissed it, like you grow out of believing in the tooth fairy. But I\u0027ve always liked to tell the story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it isn\u0027t just a story?\" Nash asked. \"What if it really happened and it keeps repeating itself through future generations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe it then?\" Mr. Worthington asked eagerly. \"Then you believe in werewolves.... Have you ever met one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Nash said. \"And so have you. In fact, you are talking to one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon and I were shocked by Nash\u0027s declaration. Mr. Worthington stared at my former boyfriend skeptically and then changed his expression. He grinned and began to chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has been so much fun, talking with you,\" he said. \"Celeste has such comical friends. It gives a little liveliness to this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there has to be more to the story,\" Nash urged. \"Did they find a cure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington thought for a moment. \"Not according to legend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps they did and you just don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cure was never part of the story I heard growing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the story is tragic,\" Nash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is. But only if you believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe it. And I don\u0027t want my story to be tragic, too. My name is Nash Hamilton. And the dude that your great-grandfather bit was one of my ancestors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington was quite shocked and didn\u0027t seem to know what to make of Nash\u0027s second declaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Nash,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, let\u0027s keep this between us.\" Brandon spoke in a low but forceful voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t hide this anymore,\" Nash continued. \"This is what\u0027s going to happen to me? Banishment to the woods? Are you kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he talking about, Celeste?\" Mr. Worthington asked. \"I thought your friend was joking. Why is he so upset?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash rose. \"This isn\u0027t what we came here for. We came here for answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few passing residents gawked at us, wondering what all the commotion was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answers to what?\" Mr. Worthington asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chill out,\" Brandon scolded Nash. \"I think it\u0027s time we leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Nash,\" I quietly chided. \"You are upsetting Mr. Worthington. And the rest of the residents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington rose. \"I\u0027m fine,\" he said. He looked at Nash. \"What answers were you looking for?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash\u0027s anger and disappointment turned to sorrow. He placed his hand on Mr. Worthington\u0027s shoulder. \"A cure for the common werewolf,\" he said, half laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is always a cure for whatever ails you - \" Mr. Worthington said. \"You just have to look inside yourself for the answer. It is closer than you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash seemed soothed by Mr. Worthington\u0027s comforting words. He shook the elderly man\u0027s hand and said good-bye to Brandon and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI apologized to Mr. Worthington as Nash left the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he be upset?\" he asked, worried. \"It\u0027s only a story. Nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He takes things very personally,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about you, Brandon?\" Mr. Worthington asked. \"Do you believe that your friend is a werewolf because he is a Hamilton descendant? Is that why you all came here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were taken aback by his questions, and Brandon stumbled for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...well - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just joking with you,\" he said. \"You kids take everything so seriously.\" He patted Brandon on his shoulder. \"It\u0027s spring. Go out there. Have some fun. And don\u0027t let her get too close to that other fellow,\" he said. \"I can tell he\u0027s a real wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, a nurse came over to Mr. Worthington and told us it was time for his music activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon and I left, distracted by Mr. Worthington\u0027s tragic story and his message about Nash. Maybe we\u0027d have to figure out what to make of it and hope that this new generation of werewolves wouldn\u0027t have to live out their lives deep in the woods in isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This makes me feel even stronger that I should take the serum as soon as I can,\" Brandon said as Nash drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Legend\u0027s Run werewolf didn\u0027t have a cure. I might have one. It would be wrong not to try it - and since my father won\u0027t let me use it for Nash, I\u0027ll have to be the one to try it. We can\u0027t spend our lives banished to the woods - with no life and no family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed his hand reassuringly as we got into his Jeep. I stared out the window as we left the retirement home behind us and thought about the words of wisdom from a man who was helping us far more than he would ever know. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-5.html","bookId":2150,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM"}
