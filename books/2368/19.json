She\u0027s supposed to be electrocuted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene changed, and she was in the electric chair. A guard reached up to pull the switch, and Judge Williams came running in screaming, \"No. We\u0027re going to kill her with a lethal injection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid woke up and sat upright in bed, his heart pounding. His pajamas were wet with perspiration. He started to get up and was suddenly dizzy. He had a pounding headache, and he felt feverish. He touched his forehead. It was hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs David started to get out of bed, he was overcome by a wave of dizziness. \"Oh, no,\" he groaned. \"Not today. Not now.\" This was the day he had been waiting for, the day the defense would begin to present its case. David stumbled into the bathroom and bathed his face in cold water. He looked in the mirror. \"You look like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David arrived in court, Judge Williams was already on the bench. They were all waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize for being late,\" David said. His voice was a croak. \"May I approach the bench?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid walked up to the bench, with Mickey Brennan close behind him. \"Your Honor,\" David said, \"I\u0027d like to ask for a one-day stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On what grounds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I\u0027m not feeling very well, Your Honor. I\u0027m sure a doctor can give me something and tomorrow I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams said, \"Why don\u0027t you have your associate take over for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid looked at her in surprise. \"I don\u0027t have an associate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you, Mr. Singer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams leaned forward. \"I\u0027ve never seen a murder trial conducted like this. You\u0027re a one-man show looking for glory, aren\u0027t you? Well, you won\u0027t find it in this court. I\u0027ll tell you something else. You probably think I should refuse myself because I don\u0027t believe in your devil-made-me-do-it defense, but I\u0027m not refusing myself. We\u0027re going to let the jury decide whether they think your client is innocent or guilty. Is there anything else, Mr. Singer?\" David stood there looking at her, and the room was swimming. He wanted to tell her to go fuck herself. He wanted to get on his knees and beg her to be fair. He wanted to go home to bed. He said in a hoarse voice, \"No. Thank you. Your Honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams nodded. \"Mr. Singer, you\u0027re on. Don\u0027t waste any more of this court\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid walked over to the jury box, trying to forget about he\u0027s headache and fever. He spoke slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen, you have listened to the prosecution ridiculing the facts of multiple personality disorder. I\u0027m sure that Mr. Brennan wasn\u0027t being deliberately malicious. His statements were made out of ignorance. The fact is that he obviously knows nothing about multiple personality disorder, and the same is true of some of the witnesses he has put on the stand. But I\u0027m going to have some people talk to you who do know about it. These are reputable doctors, who are experts in this problem. When you have heard their testimony. I\u0027m sure that it will cast a whole different light on what Mr. Brennan has had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Brennan has talked about my client\u0027s guilt in committing these terrible crimes. That\u0027s a very important point. Guilt. For murder in the first degree to be proved, there must be not only a guilty act, but also a guilty intention. I will show you that there was no guilty intention, because Ashley Patterson was not in control at the time the crimes occurred. She was totally unaware that they were taking place. Some eminent doctors are going to testify that Ashley Patterson has two additional personalities, or alters, one of them a controlling one.\" David looked into the faces of the jurors. They seemed to be swaying in front of him. He squeezed his eyes shut for an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The American Psychiatric Association recognizes multiple personality disorder. So do prominent physicians around the world who have treated patients with this problem. One of Ashley Patterson\u0027s personalities committed murder, but it was a personality - an alter -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;over which she had no control.\" His voice was getting stronger. \"To see the problem clearly, you must understand that the law does not punish an innocent person. So there is a paradox here. Imagine that a Siamese twin is being tried for murder. The law says that you cannot punish the guilty one because you would then have to punish the innocent one.\" The jury was listening intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded toward Ashley. \"In this case, we have not two but three personalities to deal with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Judge Williams. \"I would like to call my first witness. Dr. Joel Ashanti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Ashanti, where do you practice medicine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At Madison Hospital in New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you come here at my request?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I read about the trial, and I wanted to testify. I\u0027ve worked with patients who have multiple personality disorder, and I wanted to be helpful, if I could. MPD is much more common than the public realizes, and I want to try to clear up any misunderstandings about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that, Doctor. In cases like these, is it usual to find a patient with two personalities or alters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my experience, people with MPD usually have many more alters, sometimes as many as a hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleanor Tucker turned to whisper something to Mickey Brennan. Brennan smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been dealing with multiple personality disorder? Dr. Ashanti?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the past fifteen years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a patient with MPD, is there usually one alter who dominates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the jurors were making notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And is the host - the person who has those personalities within him or her - aware of the other alters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It varies. Sometimes some of the alters know all the other alters, sometimes they know only some of them. But the host is usually not aware of them, not until psychiatric treatment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very interesting. Is MPD curable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often, yes. It requires psychiatric treatment over long periods. Sometimes up to six or seven years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever been able to cure MPD patients?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid turned to study the jury for a moment. Interested, but not convinced, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Mickey Brennan. \"Your witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan rose and walked over to the witness box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Ashanti, you testified that you flew here all the way from New Yolk because you wanted to be helpful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your coming here couldn\u0027t have anything to do with the fact that this is a high-profile case and that the publicity would be beneficial to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was on his feet. \"Objection. Argumentative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overruled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Ashanti said calmly, \"I stated why I came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Since you\u0027ve been practicing medicine. Doctor, how many patients would you say you\u0027ve treated for mental disorders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, perhaps two hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And of those cases, how many would you say suffered from multiple personality disorder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dozen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan looked at him in feigned astonishment. \"Out of two bundled patients?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes. You see - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I don\u0027t see. Dr. Ashanti, is how you can consider yourself an expert if you\u0027ve dealt with only those few cases. I would appreciate it if you would give us some evidence that would prove or disprove the existence of multiple personality disorder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say proof - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in a court of law, Doctor. The jury is not going to make decisions based on theory and \u0027what if.\u0027 What if, for example, the defendant hated the men she murdered, and after killing them, decided to use the excuse of an alter inside her so that she - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was on his feet \"Objection! That\u0027s argumentative and leading the witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overruled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Honor - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Mr. Singer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid glared at Judge Williams and angrily took his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what you\u0027re telling us. Doctor, is that there\u0027s no evidence that will prove or disprove the existence of MPD?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no. But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan nodded. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Royce Salem was on the witness stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said, \"Dr. Salem, you examined Ashley Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what was your conclusion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Patterson is suffering from MPD.

Dr. Salem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fugue amnesia is a condition where the victim loses consciousness of where he is, or what he is doing.

Borden killed only two people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man added, \"And she didn\u0027t castrate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think they\u0027ll do to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? She\u0027ll get the death sentence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad the Butcher Bitch can\u0027t get three death sentences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the public speaking, David thought. He had the depressing feeling that if he walked around the restaurant, he would hear variations of the same comments. Brennan had built her up as a monster. He could hear Quiller\u0027s voice. \"If you don\u0027t put her on the stand, that\u0027s the image the jurors will carry in their minds when they go into the jury room to reach a verdict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to take the chance. I\u0027ve got to let the jurors see for themselves that Ashley\u0027s telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress was at his side. \"Are you ready to order, Mr. Singer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve changed my mind,\" David said. \"I\u0027m not hungry.\" As he got up and walked out of the restaurant, he could feel baleful eyes following him. I hope they\u0027re not armed, David thought. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-19.html","bookId":2368,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM"}
