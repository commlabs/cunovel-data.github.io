As dumb as it sounds, I think it\u0027s easier to believe in some form of telepathy than in psychometry. When you talk about psychometry, you\u0027re talking about the forces of the past. To be honest, that gives me the creeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled wryly. \"Compared to that, telepathy looks normal, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More acceptable, maybe,\" she admitted. \"Were you ever tested for that while you were at Vincent College?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Sorry to disappoint you. I showed absolutely no trace of telepathic ability, not even after the psychometry started getting so strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity sat in silence, trying to come to terms with a host of strange concepts. \"You really believe everything you\u0027re telling me, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost killed me, Verity, or worse. And it almost made me kill another man. Yeah, I believe it. I\u0027ve been forced to accept the reality of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now that you\u0027ve got me to hold on to, you want to test yourself and see if the talent is more controllable, is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I wasn\u0027t going to rush you. To be honest, I didn\u0027t know how to go about explaining the whole thing. But last night you were exposed to everything, so there\u0027s no point pretending any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity sighed. \"By all means, Jonas, let\u0027s stop the pretense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flexed his fingers on the wheel and glanced over at her. His lashes hooded his narrowed eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll help me run some tests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must be the crazy one in the car, Verity decided. \"All right. I know I\u0027ll probably live to regret this, but good help is hard to get. I don\u0027t want to have to advertise for another dishwasher. I\u0027ll let you run some experiments with me, if that\u0027s what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gracious as ever, little tyrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she looked over at him, she saw that he was grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavi poured more coffee for her employer and carried it to where Caitlin sat staring out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think you can control his actions the night of the ball?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw the way the rapier affected him last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we saw was a man who almost collapsed. When he did manage to pull himself together he went charging out of the room as if he intended to murder someone. I think he was close to being out of control, Caitlin. You said he was not a danger as long as the current context did not resemble the past associated with that rapier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His reaction was a little stronger than I expected,\" Caitlin admitted. \"But he eventually did control himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lucky he didn\u0027t put that blade into Verity\u0027s throat. Or yours, for that matter. He looked crazed when he picked it up.\" Tavi stood beside Caitlin and stared stonily out to sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin shook her head. \"It doesn\u0027t work that way. Believe me, I know what I\u0027m talking about. I studied all the research reports. Every last one of them. I know more about Quarrel than he knows about himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure that you can get him to kill Kincaid for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very sure. He\u0027s been tuned to that particular rapier now, you see. The next time he touches it, he\u0027ll fall far more quickly under its spell. That\u0027s the way it works. Once the connection has been established between him and a certain event or emotion from the past, especially the Renaissance era, it gets easier and easier to reconnect. On the night of the ball I will see to it that the present will strongly resemble the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll use the same rapier on Kincaid that was used on you,\" Tavi concluded with deep, knowing compassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Caitlin\u0027s face was a frozen mask. The scar was white against the cream of her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your plan hinges on Kincaid trying to seduce Verity. What makes you so certain Kincaid will find Verity sexually interesting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin looked at her companion in surprise. \"After all these years of studying him, I know Kincaid\u0027s habits very well. He\u0027ll be bored and looking for sexual entertainment on the night of the ball. I have made it clear that his invitation is for one, only. He won\u0027t be bringing any female companion with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity will appeal to him. She\u0027s just the type to bring out the evil in his nature. In addition, I\u0027m counting on this house, looking exactly as it did that night ail those years ago, to inspire some memories in the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kind of memories that will incite his lust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inciting lust in Kincaid is never difficult. It\u0027s his nature to always be on the lookout for victims. I will see to it that Verity will look like a victim. Dressed in a Renaissance gown with her hair pulled into one of the classic styles, I think she will be quite striking. In addition, there is a rather charming aura of innocence about her, don\u0027t you think? That should be the frosting on the cake as far as Kincaid is concerned. He won\u0027t be able to resist the opportunity of despoiling something that is cleaner and more innocent than himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verity is no innocent. She\u0027s sleeping with Quarrel,\" Tavi pointed out quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin smiled. \"Innocence is not just a matter of virginity, Tavi. You should know that. It\u0027s a thing of the spirit. Verity\u0027s spirit is still bright and clean. It shows in her eyes and in her smile. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s why Quarrel hangs around her. To a man with a spirit as haunted as his must be, she would be a compelling creature. In a different way, Kincaid will find her equally fascinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it, Caitlin. I don\u0027t like any of it. This plan you\u0027ve constructed is too complex, too dangerous. It\u0027s not too late to cancel everything. We can put all the vengeance behind us and get on with our lives.\" Tavi spoke with the desperation of a woman making one last stand against a terrible future. \"Please think this through one more time, I beg you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have thought of little else since the night Kincaid raped me, Tavi. Believe me, I have done all the thinking necessary. The way I have chosen will bring me justice and satisfaction and maybe peace. It is the only way that will. When this is over, everyone will call it a great tragedy. They\u0027ll say Quarrel was mentally unstable, that he must have gone crazy. No one will connect the killing with me. Only you and I and Kincaid will know that justice has finally been done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In killing Kincaid, I fear you will kill yourself, Caitlin,\" Tavi said. \"It\u0027s not worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" Caitlin said calmly. \"It will be worth it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-51.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
