A sigil he had not seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangers indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForeigners. Here, in the land of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the mask, he scowled. Gone. Too long. Am I now the stranger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy drumbeats reverberated through the ground heneath his feet. He straightened. His companions were returning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, no vengeance after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there was time yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mournful howl of wolves had awakened him this morning, their calls the first to draw him here, to this place, as if they sought a witness, as if indeed they had summoned him. While their cries had urged him on, he had not caught sight of the beasts, not once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves had fed, however, some time this morning. Dragging bodies from the press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis steps slowed as he made his way down the slope, slowed until he stood, his breath drawn in and held as he looked more closely at the dead soldiers on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves have fed. But not as wolves do… not like… like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChests torn open, ribs jutting… they had devoured hearts. Nothing else. Just the hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drumbeats were louder now, closer, the rake of talons hissing through grass. Overhead, the ravens, screaming, fled in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBook One. The Emperor In Gold\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lie stands alone, the solitary deceit with its back turned no matter the direction of your reluctant approach, and with each step your goal is driven on, your stride carried astray, the path enfolding upon itself, round and round you walk and what stood alone before you, errant as mischance, an accidental utterance, now reveals its legion of children, this mass seething in threads and knots and surrounded, you cannot draw breath, cannot move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world is of your making and one day, my friend, you will stand alone amidst a sea of dead, the purchasing of your words all about you and the wind will laugh you a new path into unending torment-the solitary deceit is its solitude, the lie is the lie standing alone, the threads and knots of the multitude tighten in righteous judgement with which you once so freely strangled every truthsayer, every voice of dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now ease your thirst on my sympathy and die parched in the wasteland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– Fragment found on the day the poetess Tesora Veddict was arrested by the Patriotists (six days before her Drowning)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo forces, once in vicious opposition, now found themselves virtual bedmates, although neither could decide which of them had their legs pried open first. The simple facts are these: the original hierarchical structure of the Tiste Edur tribes proved well-suited to the Letherii system of power through wealth. The Edur became the crown, settling easy upon the bloated gluttony of Lether, but does a crown possess will? Does the wearer buckle beneath its burden? Another truth is now, in hindsight, self-evident. As seamless as this merging seemed to be, a more subtle, far deadlier conjoining occurred below the surface: that of the specific flaws within each system, and this blending was to prove a most volatile brew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– The Hiroth Dynasty (Volume XVII), The Colony, a History of Lether , Dinith Arnara\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where is this one from?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal Yathvanar watched the Invigilator slowly rotating the strange object in his pudgy hands, the onyx stones in the many rings on the short fingers glimmering in the shafts of sunlight that reached in through the opened window. The object Karos Invictad manipulated was a misshapen collection of bronze pins, the ends bent into loops that were twisted about one another to form a stiff cage. ‘Bluerose, I believe, sir,’ Tanal replied. ‘One of Senorbo’s. The average duration for solving it is three days, although the record is just under two-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who?’ Karos demanded, glancing up from where he sat behind his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A Tarthenal half-blood, if you can believe that, sir. Here in Letheras. The man is reputedly a simpleton, yet possesses a natural talent for solving puzzles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And the challenge is to slide the pins into a con-figuration to create a sudden collapse.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir. It flattens out. From what I have heard the precise number of manipulations is-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Tanal, do not tell me. You should know better.’ The Invigilator, commander of the Patriotists, set the object down. ‘Thank you for the gift. Now,’ a brief smile, ‘have we inconvenienced Bruthen Trana long enough, do you think?’ Karos rose, paused to adjust his crimson silks-the only colour and the only material he ever wore-then collected the short sceptre he had made his official symbol of office, black bloodwood from the Edur homeland with silver caps studded in polished onyx stones, and gestured with it in the direction of the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-6.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
