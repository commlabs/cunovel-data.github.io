Elf Girl, with the nose ring, or Miss Hippie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham chuckled at the nicknames. “Fine. I’m sort of into Elf Girl. Her real name is Tori. But seriously—nothing’s going to happen. I’ve liked her for two months, and it hasn’t gone anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you actually ever talked to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, no.” Graham buried half his foot in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria groaned good-naturedly. “That should be your first clue that nothing’s going to happen. She seems perfect for you. Go offer to get her a soda from the drinks cart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now?” Graham looked panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, now!” Aria really, really liked this idea. Here was her chance to do something nice for Graham. It was a chance to atone for Tabitha, too. Square things up with the universe. Restore her karma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched over to the drinks cart and purchased four Oranginas, two for them and two for the girls. “Now you don’t even have to buy her a drink. Just go and offer these to Elf and Hippie. That’ll strike up a conversation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know!” Aria exclaimed, laughing out loud. “French beverages, whatever! Now c’mon, do it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham licked his lips. But after a moment, the tortured look on his face fell away, and he seemed almost a little excited. “Okay,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe padded across the sand, holding the squash-shaped bottles in his hands. The girls shaded their eyes when he approached. They accepted the drinks and unscrewed the tops. Graham squatted down and said something to Elf Girl, and Elf Girl giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Aria thought, taking a swig of her Orangina. She felt like Cupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, her phone chimed from inside her bag. She reached for it. One new text message. The sender was a jumble of letters and numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver snaked up her spine. Two tourists wearing fanny packs stared confusedly at a map across the street from the beach. A beautiful black woman in an island-print bikini spread out her towel on the sand. A girl approached the drinks cart and asked for a limeade. When she moved out of the way, Aria locked eyes with her. It was Naomi. Her blue eyes didn’t blink. There was a nasty smile on her face, and she held a cell phone tightly in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria spun away fast, almost walking into a moving car. Then she looked down at her own phone and pressed READ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood for you for helping him get back in the game, Aria. Everyone needs a little “push,” don’t they?—A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDUETS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate that afternoon, after her Caribbean jewelry-making course finished, Hanna plopped down at a bistro table with Mike and perused the big leather menu the waitress had just delivered to them. Mike sniffed the air and made a face. “Ugh. Something smells like goat poop. I think it’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna snickered. “That’s what you get for working on the on-board organic farm.” Naturally, the cruise ship had its own chicken coops, alpaca pens, and greenhouse, and Mike had signed up for volunteer duty. “What possessed you to work there, anyway?” she asked. “You should have asked to be on the gym staff or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike shook his head woefully. “When I saw hydroponic and greenhouse in the description, I thought it was a pot farm. I didn’t know I’d have to spend two hours milking goats. Do you know how badly those things reek?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna poked him. “Well, you’d better take another shower, stinky. Otherwise you’re sleeping on the floor tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike sat up. “So does that mean you’re staying in my room again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stared absently at the shuffleboard tape marks on the deck. “Is that okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it is,” Mike said emphatically. “But c’mon, Hanna. Squeezing into a twin bed isn’t really your thing. Did you and Naomi have a fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna pretended to be fascinated with the ice cubes in her glass, not wanting to meet Mike’s eye. Though it was really cozy to snuggle in bed with Mike, she was the type of sleeper who thrashed around at night, needing a lot of space. She’d woken up several times last night on the verge of falling out of the bed. Besides that, Mike’s room smelled kind of like a wet dog, and his roommate, a kid from Tate, farted in his sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seemed like you guys were getting along at Mason’s party,” Mike added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna winced as she relived the moment when she’d clapped eyes on Naomi’s fake ID. “It doesn’t matter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike buttered a piece of bread. “I don’t get you girls and your stupid feuds. You know what I think you and Naomi should do? Strip down, have a good old-fashioned mud-wrestle, and pretty soon you’ll work out all of your problems!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then we’ll kiss, I suppose?” Hanna deadpanned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike’s eyes lit up. “Only if you want to!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna smacked him, then gave her order to the waitress. She knew Mike wanted a better explanation, but what could she say? I’m afraid to be around Naomi because I crashed her cousin’s car and left the girl for dead, and now I’m worried that Naomi either just found out or that she’s always known and is torturing me as A. Sorry I never told you any of this until now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really, really didn’t want Naomi to be New A, especially because of how they’d bonded at the party. Things had felt so natural between them, like they were long-lost friends. And what about all that stuff Naomi had said about exercise bingeing? Had she made that up simply to gain Hanna’s trust, so she could carry out her diabolical plans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did make sense that Naomi was A, though—at least one of the As. She could have effortlessly eavesdropped on so many secrets, what with her fast friendship with Kate. And she could have trailed Hanna to the photo session with skeevy Patrick, who had wanted to post her slightly inappropriate pictures online. Naomi had been at the flash mob when Hanna met Liam Wilkinson, her father’s rival’s son—she could have spotted them making out in the alley. Gathering dirt on Hanna’s little Colleen-stalking mission would have been a piece of cake, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had plenty of motive. How many dirty looks had Naomi and Riley given Hanna and the other girls after Ali invited them into her brand-new clique? How many times had Naomi tried to take Hanna down—and failed? Okay, so Jamaica didn’t really make sense—but maybe she was working with someone else, someone who’d recruited her onto the A-Team once Madison died. If Naomi knew Hanna had been the driver, had potentially hurt Madison while moving her, and then had abandoned her—well, that would push anyone to seek revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t like Hanna had meant to crash the car, though. She’d actually thought she was being a good Samaritan for driving Madison home. At the end of the night, it was clear Madison was in no state to drive—she had been slurring her words and practically falling asleep on the bar. Hanna had looked at Jackson, the bartender. “Do you have numbers for cabs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson propped his elbows on the counter and chuckled, as though this were a frat party. “Yeah, she’s pretty wasted, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No cabs!” Madison crowed. “I’m fine!” She twirled the key ring around her finger, but it flew off and skidded under a video poker machine. When she bent down on her hands and knees to retrieve it, the whole bar got a view of her pink thong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it,” Hanna had said, slapping down a twenty to cover Madison’s bill. She gathered Madison’s purse from under the stool and yanked the girl to her feet. “I’m driving you home, okay? Where do you live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can drive, Olivia,” Madison whined, using the fake name Hanna had given her. “I’m serfectly pober! I mean perfectly bober! I mean …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when she turned green, bent at the waist, and puked on her Coach flats. Patrons backed away, looking disgusted. Jackson wrinkled his nose. “Come on,” Hanna said, dragging Madison out the door before she could vomit again. She felt a tiny spiral of worry as she took Madison’s keys—she’d had a drink, too. But it was hours ago, and she’d nursed it. She’d drive a few miles under the speed limit to make sure no cops would stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow a bunch of girls rushed to the side of the ship, pulling Hanna from her thoughts. “Are those dolphins?” someone cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike rose to see, but Hanna remained in her seat, her thoughts still churning. It seemed so unlikely that Naomi could have found out she was the driver that night—not unless Madison woke up and remembered, which would have been impossible if she’d died. Had she seen the crash happen from her new house, taking in everything through the trees? But that didn’t make sense, either—if she’d watched, surely she’d seen that car come out of nowhere and run Hanna off the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There you are!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna looked up. Naomi stood above her, dressed in a green Diane von Furstenberg wrap dress and raffia sandals. She held a glass of grapefruit juice in her hand and smelled, as usual, of Kate Spade Twirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just heard the best gossip about that Erin Bang Bang girl,” Naomi said conspiratorially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna blinked, unnerved by Naomi’s approach. “What was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi plopped down in Mike’s seat. “Apparently, someone heard her talking on the phone with her mom. And get this—she was pretending like she was a complete angel, saying how she was praying every morning, spending a lot of time with her classmates, and avoiding parties and boys. Can you believe it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna eyed Naomi carefully. Her eyes were twinkling, and she had a sweet smile on her face. She seemed so harmless, not like a malicious killer. But this was probably part of her plan as A. Still, Hanna thought about the strategy Spencer had suggested to earn Naomi’s trust and figure out if she was A. She could fake-friend her. All of a sudden, it seemed feasible. Maybe Hanna could even figure out if Naomi really knew about the accident with Madison, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cracked a tiny smile. “If only we could post Erin’s dalliances in a place where Mama Bang Bang would see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously.” Naomi chuckled, taking the bait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna laid down her napkin. “I saw a sign that it’s Karaoke Night tonight. Want to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi raised an eyebrow. “Only if you’ll sing a duet with me. I hate doing karaoke alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go now,” Naomi suggested. “I have the perfect song for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stood just as Mike returned from dolphin-spotting. He gave her a confused look, which she avoided with a kiss to his cheek. “I’ll see you later,” she said breezily, then glided away. Hopefully he didn’t notice how badly her hands were shaking as she followed Naomi to the elevators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe karaoke lounge was two levels down, and they could hear caterwauling all the way from the elevator bank. There was a small, dimly lit stage at the front of the room, and the room’s small, round tables were filled with kids. Hanna noticed a cute, dark-haired guy sitting by himself near the bathrooms. It was Graham, the boy Aria was partnered with for the scavenger hunt. Aria had shown her pictures of him on the Tabitha Clark Memorial website. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burned-pretty-little-liars-12/page-14.html","bookId":2388,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM"}
