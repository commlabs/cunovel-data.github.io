Dudley jerked awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the cannon?\" he said stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I\u0027m armed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Then --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSMASH!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t make us a cup o\u0027 tea, could yeh? It\u0027s not been an easy journey...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An\u0027 here\u0027s Harry!\" said the giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Las\u0027 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u0027ve got yer mom\u0027s eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\u0027s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u0027ll taste all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, I haven\u0027t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u0027s whole arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I\u0027d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\u0027ve got it, mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u0027t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u0027d sunk into a hot bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don\u0027t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant chuckled darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yer great puddin\u0027 of a son don\u0027 need fattenin\u0027 anymore, Dursley, don\u0027 worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u0027t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\u0027m sorry, but I still don\u0027t really know who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\u0027 like I told yeh, I\u0027m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh\u0027ll know all about Hogwarts, o\u0027 course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er -- no,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid looked shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry ?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It\u0027s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\u0027t gettin\u0027 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\u0027t even know abou\u0027 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u0027 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All what?\" asked Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus\u0027 one second!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin\u0027 abou\u0027 -- about ANYTHING?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\u0027t bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u0027 world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\u0027re famous. You\u0027re famous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? My -- my mom and dad weren\u0027t famous, were they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeh don\u0027 know... yeh don\u0027 know... \" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeh don\u0027 know what yeh are ?\" he said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\u0027 you\u0027ve kept it from him all these years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry -- yer a wizard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a what ?\" gasped Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wizard, o\u0027 course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an\u0027 a thumpin\u0027 good \u0027un, I\u0027d say, once yeh\u0027ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\u0027 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\u0027 I reckon it\u0027s abou\u0027 time yeh read yer letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf.

Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours sincerely,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinerva McGonagall,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Headmistress\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions exploded inside Harry\u0027s head like fireworks and he couldn\u0027t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gallopin\u0027 Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Professor Dumbledore,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven Harry his letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeather\u0027s horrible. Hope you\u0027re well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\" said Harry, interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\u0027s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\u0027 it\u0027s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\u0027 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We swore when we took him in we\u0027d put a stop to that rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"swore we\u0027d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew ?\" said Harry. \"You knew I\u0027m a -- a wizard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that -- that school -- and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\u0027d be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an\u0027 James Potter? It\u0027s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\u0027 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger faded from Hagrid\u0027s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\u0027 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\u0027t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u0027 know if I\u0027m the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone\u0027s gotta -- yeh can\u0027t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can\u0027t tell yeh everythin\u0027, it\u0027s a great myst\u0027ry, parts of it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it\u0027s incredible yeh don\u0027t know his name, everyone in our world knows--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well -- I don\u0027 like sayin\u0027 the name if I can help it. No one does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gulpin\u0027 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah -- can\u0027t spell it. All right -- Voldemort.\" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don\u0027 make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\u0027 fer followers. Got \u0027em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\u0027 his power, \u0027cause he was gettin\u0027 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\u0027t know who ter trust, didn\u0027t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin\u0027 over. \u0027Course, some stood up to him -- an\u0027 he killed \u0027em. Horribly. One o\u0027 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u0027s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u0027t dare try takin\u0027 the school, not jus\u0027 then, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, yer mum an\u0027 dad were as good a witch an\u0027 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\u0027 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\u0027ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get \u0027em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\u0027 ter do with the Dark Side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he thought he could persuade \u0027em... maybe he just wanted \u0027em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\u0027 -- an\u0027--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s that sad -- knew yer mum an\u0027 dad, an\u0027 nicer people yeh couldn\u0027t find -- anyway...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-Know-Who killed \u0027em. An\u0027 then -- an\u0027 this is the real myst\u0027ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\u0027 by then. But he couldn\u0027t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u0027s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an\u0027 dad an\u0027 yer house, even -- but it didn\u0027t work on you, an\u0027 that\u0027s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u0027em, no one except you, an\u0027 he\u0027d killed some o\u0027 the best witches an\u0027 wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an\u0027 you was only a baby, an\u0027 you lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u0027s mind. As Hagrid\u0027s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid was watching him sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\u0027s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\u0027s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\u0027t have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world\u0027s better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they\u0027d come to a sticky end--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \"I\u0027m warning you, Dursley -- I\u0027m warning you -- one more word...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u0027s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what happened to Vol-, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u0027s the biggest myst\u0027ry, see... he was gettin\u0027 more an\u0027 more powerful -- why\u0027d he go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\u0027s still out there, bidin\u0027 his time, like, but I don\u0027 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of \u0027em came outta kinda trances. Don\u0027 reckon they could\u0027ve done if he was comin\u0027 back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of us reckon he\u0027s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \u0027Cause somethin\u0027 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\u0027 goin\u0027 on that night he hadn\u0027t counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin\u0027 about you stumped him, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\u0027d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\u0027t they been turned into warty toads every time they\u0027d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u0027d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don\u0027t think I can be a wizard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley\u0027s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\u0027d managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\u0027t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\u0027t he set a boa constrictor on him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you\u0027ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u0027t going to give in without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t I told you he\u0027s not going?\" he hissed. \"He\u0027s going to Stonewall High and he\u0027ll be grateful for it. I\u0027ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u0027t stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an\u0027 James Potter\u0027s son goin\u0027 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u0027s been down ever since he was born. He\u0027s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\u0027t know himself. He\u0027ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u0027 he\u0027ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \"NEVER -- \" he thundered, \" -- INSULT -- ALBUS -- DUMBLEDORE -- IN -- FRONT -- OF -- ME!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\u0027s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn\u0027t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\u0027t much left ter do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be grateful if yeh didn\u0027t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I\u0027m -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\u0027. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\u0027 get yer letters to yeh an\u0027 stuff -- one o\u0027 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\u0027 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were you expelled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 late and we\u0027ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\u0027 that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\u0027 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\u0027 doormice in one o\u0027 the pockets.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-harry-potter-1/page-4.html","bookId":1563,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM"}
