I was in a town a few years ago and the people there were so dirty and skinny, they were eating their dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie makes a face and puts his hands up, \"I didn’t make this war, Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Will for support, but he shakes his head, \"We can\u0027t focus on the small things. We gotta save Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow it down, the anger and pain. I fight my urge and want to rant or smash things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill starts laughing and points out the window, \"I can see a group of those little kids beating someone up. I always imagined it was a crazy story to scare people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk to where he is, and sure enough, there is a group of kids beating someone in the alley between the tall buildings. No one stops it. No one even looks at it. They walk past the alley and ignore that it\u0027s going on. A van comes tearing around the corner, stopping feet from them. Men in white suits jump out and chase the kids down. It\u0027s like watching TV when I was little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why doesn’t he stop making them, if they are like this?\" I mutter, touching my fingers to the cold glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know. He\u0027s convinced he can control them and they\u0027ll outgrow their tempers and bad behavior,\" Bernie stands next to me and sighs, \"He doesn’t see. None of them do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"What a waste of time and technology. He built this city and this life, but for what? So those freaks can overrun it and destroy everything he\u0027s worked for? Makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away from it, looking out at the city. It\u0027s small but everything gleams from the glass and metal. It looks new but the people don’t. \"Everyone looks like they do in the borderlands. They aren’t dressed fancy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill walks to where I am. The heat of his body so near mine makes me shiver, \"There are no factories or cotton fields or anything. They haven’t made a new world, they just put up walls and made a bunch of places to live. The work farms get them food and essentials, but really they aren’t much different than the rest of us. The furnishings and clothes are scavenged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie gives us a grim look, \"Except they have an army and a population of people. We feel safer in a group. People naturally want to be around other people. We used to say that before, safety in numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I feel safe here. I\u0027m not—I\u0027m not comfortable with the walls and the possibilities, but I feel safe. I could close my eyes and sleep and know nothing is going to kill me in the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"And yet, this is the most dangerous place for someone like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his face when he says it. He doesn’t attach emotions to the things he says, unless it\u0027s sarcasm. He has plenty of that. I wonder if he ever cries or feels scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill grabs my shoulders, \"Let\u0027s rest and then we\u0027ll head out in the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie points to a door to the right of us, \"That’s the guest room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I realize what\u0027s going on, Will takes my hand and pulls me to the door. When he opens it I frown and look back at Bernie, \"Is there another room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points to the door on the other side of the apartment, \"Mine.\" He grins like he\u0027s daring me. I look up at Will, \"You should go sleep with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs and pulls me into the room, closing the door behind us, \"I\u0027m not leaving your side. I\u0027ll sleep on the chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the tiny chair and the not-so-tiny bed and sigh, \"No. Just stay on your own side of the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strip my boots off and climb into the sheets in my pants. I hate bringing the filth of the day into bed with me, but these clothes are cleaner than my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and pretend I don’t notice the heat or weight of him on the bed next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drift away fast, mostly because he is there. He is the safest thing in the world. Him and Leo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake feeling heat under and around me and moan. I try to run my fingers through the fur but I find skin, hot skin. I open one eye to find myself splayed across him, like I do to Leo. I feel moisture under my face and wince. I lift my hand slowly to wipe away the spit I\u0027ve left all over him. I glance up, hoping to find him sleeping still, but I find his grinning face instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evening, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulp, \"Sorry.\" I wipe the spit with the sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, shaking us both and hugs me down onto his chest again. \"For a shy prude of a girl you are a naughty sleeper.\" I pull back but his thick arm traps me to him, \"Oh, you aren’t going anywhere now. You\u0027ve been rubbing me and squeezing me all afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heartbeat picks up. I feel panic. His words are threats in my brain, but his gentle smile and blazing eyes don’t scare me. He doesn’t scare me. I realize it now. It\u0027s been a game in my mind to keep him at bay, I scare me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls me on my side, trapping me. It feels tight, constraining but I like it. Like we are in a cocoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands tremble where they press into his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles devilishly and presses his lips against mine. The heat and intensity of him pressing against me, makes sparks where our skin connects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue slides into my parted lips. I kiss the way he does, slipping my tongue against his. Our wet lips caress and suck each others. He sucks my tongue and I catch a moan escaping me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breathing increases with my hands movements. I knead his thick, muscled back, gripping him and pulling him down on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves between my thighs, pressing himself against me. I don’t know what\u0027s happening, but I\u0027m pressing myself against him back. He\u0027s gentle and delicate with his kisses and caresses. His hand rubs from my lower leg to my upper thigh. He breaks our kiss and gently kisses my throat. He cups my butt cheek firmly, lifting me almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not how I imagined it, none of it. He\u0027s soft and delicate. He sits back and opens the buttons on my shirt softly, he plants a kiss on my exposed skin as each button comes off. He opens the shirt. My hands naturally lift to cover me. As I cover my breasts, my walls start rebuilding themselves. I shake my head, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and laughs, \"Okay.\" He climbs off the bed and pulls on his shirt. He\u0027s panting, we both are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me and I see something I\u0027ve never seen from him—understanding. He isn’t mad, he isn’t mean, he isn’t being sarcastic or rude. He gets it. He sees how scared I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown and take an inventory of my feelings. I\u0027m not scared. I want him. I want him to climb back into the bed. I want him to rub against me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the door and nod, \"See if it locks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe furrows his brow, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, still covering myself, \"See if it locks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts to get what I\u0027m saying, \"It does. I locked it when we came in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and remove my hands from my chest. I put them on the bed, gripping the sheets that are still warm from his body being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arches an eyebrow and I nod in tiny twitches. He pulls his shirt off and drops his pants. He takes a step in his underwear and gives me the look once more. I take him in. His body is beautiful. He\u0027s muscled and smooth and I want to slowly touch every inch of him. My eyes dart to his underwear and nod, \"Yes.\" I want to touch every inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbs into the bed and pulls back the covers. His fingers tremble as much as mine do as he pulls off my pants. We are both just in a pair of underwear. He loops his fingers into the sides of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin breaks across his face as he pulls them down and I stifle the heart attack, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m having.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I would, but I wasn’t expecting it to be as much as it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe keeps giving me a weird look, like he\u0027s scared of me or for me. I can just see it in his face thanks to the last of the sunlight coming in the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown finally, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cheeks are still flushed. He shakes his head and licks his lips, \"Nothing. Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just not what I was expecting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comment hurts my feelings—feelings I didn’t know could get hurt. I feel myself pulling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees my look, \"In a good way. Not what I was expecting in a good way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze, \"We should get going.\" I don’t want to talk about it and his face is weird. He looks a bit like I imagine Jake would, self-conscience or nervous. He doesn\u0027t have the cocky Will face I\u0027m used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me into his chest again and kisses the top of my head, \"I love you, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up, \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"Yeah, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"You\u0027re acting like a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"Want me to rough you up a bit?\" He cocks an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"I\u0027ll still shoot you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses again, \"I know you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awkwardness in the air is interrupted by a knock, thankfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys ready to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill clears his throat, \"Yup. Out in two.\" He looks at me, \"You should stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimace, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I was thinking you should stay here, in case we get caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrow, \"It\u0027s not safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, like I\u0027m trying to rattle his words out of my brain. I climb off the bed and fish my underwear and pants out of the sheets. I pull them on fast. I don’t like being naked around him, which is weird, considering what we just did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull on my socks and boots and walk from the room, leaving him still getting dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie looks at me with a grin, \"Sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blush and look down, \"Yeah. I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points to the kitchen, \"I have a bunch of food ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk past him to the kitchen and grab a bun. I smell it. We never get bread, ever. He always has bread it seems. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-27.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
