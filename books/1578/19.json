I\u0027m not usually involved with interrogations, but I was the only one around, and, well, beggars can\u0027t be choosers. Am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to go easy on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha. That\u0027s the spirit,\" Terry said. \"We\u0027re going to get along. I can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, I\u0027ve got a list of questions and procedures here, so that should help things along.\" He produced a pencil and a clipboard from his briefcase. \"First question: are you here to kill the Czar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" Mortimer said, \"I think I can save us some time. If I can just talk to the Czar-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry tsked, sucked air through his teeth. \"Yeah, the thing is, I just have this list of questions, and I\u0027d feel better if we just got through them. I\u0027m a rules kind of guy, and, look, I\u0027m going to be square with you, okay? I\u0027m a little out of my comfort zone, so I really think I should stick with the format.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s skip ahead,\" Terry said. \"Are you here to steal gasoline or sabotage Red Stripe gasoline supplies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Super. Now let\u0027s-\" Terry consulted the clipboard. \"Oh, wait. It says here not to believe you and in parentheses it says slap face.\" Terry tsked again. \"I guess we can skip that. Things are going well enough, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone-faced guard cleared his throat, shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Terry seemed disappointed. \"Rules are rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry leaned forward, swung his hand in a wide arc and caught Mortimer\u0027s face with a loud, stinging slap. Lights danced in front of Mortimer\u0027s eyes. He tasted blood, his cheek having caught on some teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry flipped a page on the clipboard, then another page, reading ahead. \"Oh, dear. Looks like we\u0027re in for a long day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer assumed the dungeon had not been installed as part of the CNN Center\u0027s original design. He hung from a damp stone wall, held there with manacles and heavy chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry hadn\u0027t enjoyed a moment of the interrogation, but he was very conscientious about his job, had even taken twenty minutes to find a hand-rolled cigarette among the troops so he could burn Mortimer\u0027s forearm as the clipboard instructed. There had been more slaps and punches in between predictable questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer told him everything he could without giving away the show, sticking as close to the truth as possible. Yes, he was a Platinum member. Yes, he\u0027d recently been to the Armageddon\u0027s on Lookout Mountain. Yes, he\u0027d busted out of jail and escaped south. Had he been part of the recent disturbance at Stone Mountain? Huh? Who? What are you talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer answered question after question, many seemingly irrelevant. But Mortimer had his chance too, made sure Terry knew that Mortimer had valuable information and was looking to trade. He\u0027d talk only to the Red Czar himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they\u0027d put him in the dungeon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung there, shoulders aching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was half asleep, in a daze, when he heard the dungeon door creak open. He didn\u0027t open his eyes right away. If they were coming to dump more punishment on him, maybe they\u0027d leave him alone if they thought he\u0027d passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard movement, somebody close to him. He felt a soft hand on his face, a cool, wet rag dabbing at the corners of his mouth. He felt something being applied to the cigarette burns on his forearm, a salve of some kind. Instant relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer chanced opening one eye, looked down at the top of a woman\u0027s head, rich brown hair with three thin strips of gray radiating from her part down the center. She stooped over a bucket, wrung out a rag in clean water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so thirsty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" His voice so hoarse and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How disappointing. You don\u0027t recognize your own wife,\" Anne said. \"It\u0027s only been nine years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXLVII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anne?\" Mortimer blinked, looked into her pale blue eyes. She smiled. The gray in her hair told the years, a few more laugh lines at the eyes. But her tan face glowed smooth and young like on their wedding day, lips full, posture firm and athletic. She wore a heavy brown robe, looked like a medieval monk. She was okay. She looked good and she was okay. He\u0027d come so far. She was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne\u0027s smile fell. \"What are you doing? Don\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears came hot and fast, sobs wracking his body, rattling the chains. He tried to talk, tried to tell her everything he felt upon seeing her, the love and regret and fear and so many things mixed together that not even he understood fully. He couldn\u0027t speak, could only gulp for breath between great heaving sobs, snot running over his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne wiped at a tear in the corner of her own eye, wiped the snot off Mortimer\u0027s face with the rag. \"You were always a sentimental jerk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S-sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really didn\u0027t know? \"I came for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was nine years ago.\" Disbelief in her eyes. \"I\u0027m not your wife anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never signed the divorce papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted laughter. \"Really? Divorce papers? Filed in what court? Do you think legal paperwork matters anymore? Do you think our mortgage matters, our life insurance policy? Where do you think you\u0027re going to cash the savings bonds your uncle gave us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to agree. I agreed for both of us.\" She shook her head, went on, her voice softer. \"This isn\u0027t really about our marriage, is it? It\u0027s been so long. You haven\u0027t really been thinking of me as your wife. Not after all this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Not really. He couldn\u0027t imagine anything could really be between them, not anymore, after so much had happened. \"I had to see you. Just to know. After the way we left it. I felt I owed you. I wanted...I wanted to feel right about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did sort of leave me high and dry,\" Anne said. She continued to wipe his face as she spoke. \"I didn\u0027t care for your little prank, and I wasn\u0027t going to stomp around the pocket wilderness with the divorce papers in one hand and a ballpoint pen in the other, calling your name. I\u0027d hoped you\u0027d come to your senses, come home and act like an adult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, let out a long sigh. She lifted a cup to Mortimer\u0027s lips. \"Drink. Slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank. Relief on his raw throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I would have waited you out,\" she continued, \"but Mother called from Chattanooga. She was scared. You know she lives-lived-in kind of an iffy neighborhood. So I was caught there when all the shit really hit the fan. We actually made it through the first year okay, but she died that winter. I made my way back to Spring City.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mortimer, but no. Oh, I wondered if I\u0027d see you, but no. I wanted to go home. That simple. So stupid. My house wasn\u0027t mine anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took up wandering. Learned to kill to survive. I traded myself for food. Don\u0027t look at me like that. You know things are different now. I got tough fast. Sometimes, I thought I wanted to die, but it was never true. I wanted to live. And if you want to live, you have to understand the way things are and adjust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get you out of here,\" Mortimer said. \"Maybe that won\u0027t make up for everything, but it\u0027s a start. I\u0027ll figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did getting chained to the dungeon wall fit into the rescue plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you could get me down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No way. They let me come in to clean you up and give you some water. I think they want me to tell you to cooperate. Maybe they think seeing me will soften you up. They knew I was your wife. Did you tell them you were here for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them I was here for another reason. It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s my advice: Look out for yourself. If you can get loose, don\u0027t worry about me. I suggest telling them whatever they want to know. They can make things bad for you if they want to, a lot worse than chaining you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne frowned, made a disgusted noise. \"Knock off the hero crap. I absolve you, okay? You\u0027re forgiven, so don\u0027t feel you owe me anything. Besides, when I was captured, they got some of my girls too, a dozen of them. I was taking them to Little Rock to open a new Joey Armageddon\u0027s. I\u0027m responsible for them, and I\u0027m not leaving them. So you see, I can\u0027t run off with you just so you can feel like a good guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Mortimer said. \"I\u0027ve come a long way-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not the only one who\u0027s come a long way and been through a lot. So have I. So have my girls. Get over yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted the cup to his lips again. \"Drink more. I\u0027ll probably have to go soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gulped, emptied the cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least tell me why you\u0027re wearing that robe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This?\" She stood back, opened it. Underneath she wore a hot-pink bikini. She was thinner than he remembered, stomach muscles well defined, long legs. It was the wrong place and the wrong time, but Mortimer felt the stirrings of arousal. He remembered those early days of the marriage, her legs wrapped around him, making love all night in a sweaty pile. He wanted to cry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the robe, sighed. \"The Czar keeps us all like a harem. We all have to wear bathing suits and underwear like it\u0027s the fucking Playboy Mansion or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he make you...do things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We never see him. I wonder if he even exists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer managed a weak smile. \"Eight feet tall with shark teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door, a deep voice on the other side. \"Time\u0027s up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She put a gentle hand on Mortimer\u0027s face, kissed his nose. \"Thanks for coming, but get out of here, escape or whatever, but don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to say something, but it caught in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him one last sad look and was out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer Tate hung his head. If he died right then and there, that would be just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXLVIII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad it been an hour or a day? Mortimer lost track of time, hanging there, feeling useless and defeated. His arms hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone came for him at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dungeon door creaked open. The newcomer took a step inside, stopped with his hands behind his back. An older man, maybe early sixties, dressed the same as Terry Frankowski had been, black suit with the red armband. He was gaunt, tall but slightly stooped, white hair and moustache, weak chin. He looked around the dungeon with clear brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always thought this was a bit too theatrical.\" A smoker\u0027s voice, but kindly, like somebody\u0027s tough, lovable grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nice,\" Mortimer said. \"I\u0027m thinking of doing my summer home all medieval. So who the hell are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name\u0027s Ford. Jim Ford. I\u0027m Terry Frankowski\u0027s boss. I\u0027d have been the one to deal with you instead of Terry but I was off taking care of some things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You here for round two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord shook his head. \"I\u0027m just here to fetch you. Somebody wants a quick chat. But don\u0027t get complacent. I was an Atlanta cop for twenty-two years, and I know how to get information out of a suspect. And there\u0027s none of that Miranda bullshit keeping me from bringing in the thumbscrews. I figure I\u0027ll have my crack at you sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I like you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it up, smartass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord fished a ring of keys out of his pocket and approached Mortimer. Behind him two more thugs with pistols appeared in the doorway. Mortimer\u0027s shoulders were sore as hell. He didn\u0027t like the odds, but maybe after Ford got him out of the manacles, he could surprise them, get hold of one of the pistols...No. He was dreaming. They\u0027d stomp him flat. All Mortimer could do was bide his time and see what they had in store for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord unlocked him, and Mortimer collapsed to the floor. He could hardly lift his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a minute,\" Ford said. \"Try to work the circulation back in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer moved his arms, slowly at first, rubbed the shoulders. The hot tingling flooding back into his limbs was sudden, excruciating murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feels nice, don\u0027t it?\" Ford said. \"On your feet, man. Time to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer didn\u0027t see much of the CNN Center. They walked down a short hall and stepped directly into an elevator. Up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey have power. I wonder what the source is. Solar? But if they can get gasoline, maybe they can run the generators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator opened at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your stop,\" Ford said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer hesitated, then stepped off the elevator. Ford and his thugs didn\u0027t get off. The doors closed, and Mortimer was alone in a small foyer, only a single door across from the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked through the door into a large office area that had been transformed into the burlesque of a throne room. Four Red Stripes stood on either side of the room in straight lines, holding their rifles at attention. On the far side of the room was an enormous chair covered in red velvet, trimmed in gold. A large flag behind the throne, white with a red stripe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man sitting in the throne stood to face Mortimer. He wasn\u0027t ten feet tall, not even eight. But he was seven feet if he was an inch, and when he smiled, Mortimer saw the man\u0027s teeth had been filed to points. He wore a leather vest, no shirt, muscles rippling like Conan. He had a square, Frankenstein face, greasy hair. He carried a wooden club like a caveman\u0027s. He wore a necklace of human ears and noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer gulped. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-19.html","bookId":1578,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM"}
