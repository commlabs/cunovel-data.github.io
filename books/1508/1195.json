Sacred Yueping was flushed with anger, wishing that he could tear apart Lin Ming on the spot.

Although that previous collision had a surprising result, everyone was still surprised to hear these words tumble out from between Sacred Tianhao’s lips.

But now, in Sacred Tianhao’s mind, Lin Ming had an unfathomable flavor to him that he just couldn’t place his finger on. Even Zhong Wenshu was killed by his hand. If the three of them fought Lin Ming, there would inevitably be deaths, and they might even lose. In this sort of situation, coming into conflict with Lin Ming simply wasn’t a wise move.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming smiled. “Your plan is quite well thought out.

As long as one was placed within this force field, they would have to bear the crushing pressure of the mountains and earth. If one’s cultivation was insufficient, they would directly be pulverized into mush. If one’s cultivation was sufficient, they would still be restrained. The domain would even damage their organs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Deep Earth Force Field came down, all of the surrounding martial artists felt a stuffiness in their chest. They all rapidly began to move away. At this time, they were already very far from Sacred Tianhao, and they weren’t bearing the brunt of his attack. Even so, they felt as if someone had dropped a mountain on their backs, making it difficult to even breathe. The power of this force field could be imagined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Sacred Yanran cried out and turned into a red afterimage as she hurtled toward Lin Ming.

Because of the grandmist space, he couldn’t slow down Lin Ming’s speed with the Time Laws, but speeding up Sacred Yanran was actually simple and easy, and the effect was nearly the same.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe three joined forces to attack together.

Even the red bamboo hat woman was a bit startled. She didn’t fear any one of Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies; she would be able to defeat any of them in a one versus one. But when the three of them attacked together, their combat strength actually increased by several times.
