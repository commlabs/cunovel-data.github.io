Can they still make it, Reid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid was crumpled in his chair, looking miserable. \"They can make it.

We can\u0027t probe into the brain to pull them out, you know. If we could do that, we would have been able to probe into it for the clot in the first place. That means they\u0027ve got to get to the brain and then proceed to some point where they can be removed. If they don\u0027t ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter said, querulously. \"I\u0027ve been brought two cups of coffee and one cigar and I haven\u0027t had one sip or one puff ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re reaching the base of the brain, sir,\" came the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels was back at his chart. Grant was at his shoulder, staring at the complexities before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the clot here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Michaels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks a long distance off. We only have twelve minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not as far away as it looks. We\u0027ll have clear sailing now.

Grant looked up in astonishment and saw, outside, a tremendous wall of milky light, its boundaries invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ear-drum,\" said Michaels. \"On the other side, the outside world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn almost unbearably poignant homesickness pulled at Grant. He had almost forgotten that there was an outside world. It seemed to him at that moment that all his life he had been travelling endlessly through a nightmare world of tubes and monsters, a Flying Dutchman of the circulatory system ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there it was, the light of the outside world, filtering through the ear-drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, bending over the chart, \"You ordered me back into the ship from the hair cells, didn\u0027t you, Grant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did, Michaels. I wanted you on the ship, not at the hair cells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell that to Duval. His attitude ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why worry. His attitude is always unpleasant, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time, he was insulting.

Suppose we go in past the oculomotor nerve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" said Michaels. \"If that will give you the most favorable shot at the clot, that\u0027s how we\u0027ll go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant backed away, and bent his head to get into the storage room where Cora was lying on a cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made as though to get up, but he lifted his hand. \"Don\u0027t. Stay there.\" And he sat on the floor beside her, knees up and enclosed in his arms. He smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027m all right now. I\u0027m just malingering, lying here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You\u0027re the most beautiful malingerer I\u0027ve ever seen. Let\u0027s malinger together for a minute, if you don\u0027t think that sounds too improper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled in her turn. \"It would be difficult for me to complain that you were too forward. After all, you seem to make a career of saving my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All part of a shrewd and extraordinarily subtle campaign to place you under an obligation to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am! Most decidedly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remind you of that at the proper time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please do. -But Grant, really, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your thanking me, but it\u0027s my job. That\u0027s why I was sent along. Remember. I make decisions on policy and I take care of emergencies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not all, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite enough,\" protested Grant. \"I plug snorkels into lungs, pull seaweed out of intakes and most of all I hold on to beautiful women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not all, is it? You\u0027re here to keep an eye on Dr. Duval, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s true. The higher echelons at the CMDF don\u0027t trust Dr. Duval. They never have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he is a dedicated man; completely innocent and completely involved. He offends others not because he wants to, but because he honestly doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s offensive. He doesn\u0027t know that anything exists beside his work...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even beautiful assistants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora flushed. \"I suppose-not even assistants. But he values my work; he really does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d keep right on valuing your work, wouldn\u0027t he, if someone else valued you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora looked away, then went on firmly, \"But he\u0027s not disloyal. One trouble is he favors free exchange of information with the Other Side and says so because he doesn\u0027t know how to keep his views unobtrusive. Then, when others disagree with him he tells them how foolish he thinks they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant nodded. \"Yes, I can imagine. And that makes everybody love him because people just adore being told how foolish they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s the way he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look. Don\u0027t sit there and worry. I don\u0027t mistrust Duval, any more than I do anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michaels does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. Michaels has moments where he mistrusts everyone, both in this ship and outside. He even mistrusts me. But I assure-you I give that only the weight I think it deserves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora looked anxious. \"You mean Michaels thinks I deliberately damaged the laser? That Dr. Duval and I together . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he thinks of that as a possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Grant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think of it as a possibility, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But do you believe it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a possibility, Cora. Among many possibilities. Some possibilities are better than others. Let me worry about that end of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could answer, both heard Duval\u0027s voice raised anger: \"No, no, no. It\u0027s out of the question, Michaels. won\u0027t have a jackass tell me what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackass! Shall I tell you what you are, you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant was out front, Cora directly behind him. Grant said, \"Hold it, both of you. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval turned and said, fuming. \"I have the laser back in order. The wire is shaved to the proper size; its joined to the transistor; and it\u0027s back in place. I\u0027ve just told that to this jackass here . . .\" He turned his face toward Michaels and snapped out, \"Jackass, I said,\" then went on, \"because he asked me about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good,\" said Grant. \"What\u0027s wrong with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, heatedly, \"Because the mere fact of his saying so doesn\u0027t make it so. He\u0027s put some things together. I can do that much. Anyone can. How does he know it will work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I know. I\u0027ve worked with lasers for twelve ears. I know when they work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, show us, doctor. Let us share your knowledge. Use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Either it works or it doesn\u0027t work. If it doesn\u0027t work, I can\u0027t fix it under any circumstances because I\u0027ve done all I can and nothing further can be done. That means we\u0027ll be worse off if I wait till we get to the clot to find out that \u0027it doesn\u0027t work. But if it works, and it will work, it remains jerry-rigged. I don\u0027t know how long it will last; a dozen blasts or so at most. I want to save every one of those blasts or the clot. I won\u0027t waste a single one of them here. I won\u0027t have the mission fail because I tested the laser even once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tell you, you\u0027ve got to test the laser,\" said Michaels. \"If you don\u0027t, then I swear, Duval, that when we get back, I will have you thrown out of the CMDF so far and have you broken into so many small pieces ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll worry about that when we get back. Meanwhile this is my laser and I do as I please with it. You can\u0027t order me to do anything I don\u0027t wish to do, and neither can Grant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant shook his head. \"I\u0027m not ordering you to do anything, Dr. Duval.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval nodded briefly and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels looked after him. \"I\u0027ll get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He makes sense in this case, Michaels,\" said Grant. \"Are you sure you\u0027re not annoyed with him for personal reasons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he calls me coward and jackass? Am I supposed to love him for that? But whether I have personal animosity against him or not doesn\u0027t matter. I think he\u0027s a traitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora said, angrily, \"That\u0027s quite untrue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt,\" said Michaels freezingly, \"that you\u0027re a reliable witness in this case. -But never mind. We\u0027re getting to the clot and we\u0027ll see about Duval then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll clear that clot,\" said Cora, \"if the laser works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it works,\" said Michaels. \"And if it does, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if he kills Benes. And not by accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter had his jacket off and his sleeves rolled up. He was slumped in his chair on the base of his spine and a second cigar, freshly-lit, was in his mouth. He wasn\u0027t puffing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the brain?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid\u0027s mustache seemed bedraggled at last. He rubbed his eyes. \"Practically at the clot. They\u0027ve stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter looked at the Time Recorder, which read 9.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt used up, out of juice, out of adrenalin, out of tension, out of life. He said, \"Think they\u0027ll make it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReid shook his head. \"No, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn nine minutes, maybe ten, the men, ship and all, would be standing full-size before them-exploding Benes\u0027 body, if they hadn\u0027t gotten out in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter thought of what the newspapers would make of CMDF if this project failed. He heard the speeches from every politician in the land, and from those on the Other Side. How far would CMDF be set back? How many months-years-would it take it to recover?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWearily, he began to write his letter of resignation in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve entered the brain itself,\" announced Owens, with controlled excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doused ship\u0027s lights again and all of them looked forward in a moment of wonder that put everything else, even the climax of the mission, out of their minds for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval murmured, \"How wonderful. The supreme peak of Creation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant, for the moment, felt that. Surely the human brain was the most intensely complicated object crowded into the smallest possible volume in all the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence about their surroundings. The cells they could see were jagged, uneven, with fibrous dendrites jutting out here and there, like a bramble-bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they drifted through the interstitial fluid along passageways between the cells, they could see the dendrites tangling overhead and for a moment they were passing under what seemed the twisted limbs of a row of ancient forest tress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval said, \"See, they don\u0027t touch. You can see the synapses clearly; always that gap which must be jumped across chemically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora said, \"They seem to be full of lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, an edge of anger still in his voice, \"A mere illusion. The reflection of miniaturized light plays tricks. It bears no relation to reality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" demanded Duval, at once. \"This is an important field for study. The reflection of miniaturized light is bound to vary subtly with the structure of the molecular contents of the cell. This sort of reflection, I predict, will become a more powerful instrument for studying the micro-details of the cell than any now existing. It may well be that the techniques arising out of this mission of ours will be far more important than what happens to Benes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that how you\u0027re excusing yourself, doctor?\" asked Michaels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval reddened. \"Explain that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now!\" said Grant, imperiously. \"Not one more word, gentlemen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval drew a deep breath and turned back to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora said, \"But anyway, do you see the lights? Watch up above. Watch that dendrite as it comes close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see it,\" said Grant. The usual glittering reflections did not, as had been generally true elsewhere in the body, sparkle from this point and that randomly, making the whole look like a dense cloud of fire-flies. Instead, the sparkle chased itself along the dendrite, a new one beginning before the old one had completed its path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwens said, \"You know what it looks like. Anyone ever see films of old-fashioned advertising signs with electric lights? With waves of light and dark moving along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Cora. \"That\u0027s exactly what it\u0027s like. But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval said, \"A wave of depolarization sweeps along a nerve fiber when it is stimulated. The ion concentrations change; sodium ion enters the cell. This changes the charge intensity inside and out and lowers the electric potential. Somehow that must affect the reflection of miniaturized light-which is exactly the point I was making-and what we see is the wave of depolarization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Cora had pointed out the fact-or perhaps because they were moving ever deeper into the brain, the moving wave of sparkles could be seen everywhere; moving along the cells, climbing and descending fibers, twisting into an unimaginably complex system which seemed, at first glance, without any form of order, and yet which gave the sense of order, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we see,\" said Duval, \"is the essence of humanity. The cells are the physical brain, but those moving sparkles represent thought, the human mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the essence,\" said Michaels, harshly. \"I would have thought it was the soul. Where is the human soul, Duval?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I can\u0027t point it out, do you think it doesn\u0027t exist?\" demanded Duval. \"Where is Benes\u0027, genius? You are in his brain. Point to his genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" said Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels called up to Owens. \"We\u0027re almost there. Cross over into the capillary at the indicated point. Just push through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval said thoughtfully, \"That\u0027s the awesome thing of it. We\u0027re not just in the mind of a man. This, all about us, is the mind of a scientific genius; someone I would put almost on a par with Newton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a moment and then quoted:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... Where the statue stood Of Newton with his prism and silent face. The marble index of a mind . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant cut in, with an awed whisper:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... forever Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth were silent for an instant, and Grant said, \"Do you think Wordsworth ever thought of this, or could have, when he spoke of `strange seas of thought.\u0027 This is the literal sea of thought, isn\u0027t it? And strange it is, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora said, \"I didn\u0027t think of you as the poetic type, Grant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant nodded. \"All muscle, no mind. That\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be offended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels said, \"When you are done with mumbling poetry, gentlemen, look ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed. They were in the blood-stream again, but the red corpuscles (bluish in color) drifted without any definite motion, shuddering slightly in response to Brownian motion, no more. Up ahead was a shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA forest of dendrites could be seen through the transparent walls of the capillary; each strand, each twig with its line of sparkle moving along itself-but more slowly now, and still more slowly.
