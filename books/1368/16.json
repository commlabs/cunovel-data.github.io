The old lady, with a most affected air, poises, between her finger and thumb, a small tea-cup, with the beauties of which she appears to be highly enamoured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The gentleman, gazing with vacant wonder at that and the companion saucer which he holds in his hand, joins in admiration of its astonishing beauties!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Each varied colour of the brightest hue,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The green, the red, the yellow, and the blue,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In every part their dazzled eyes behold,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here streak’d with silver — there enrich’d with gold.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This gentleman is said to be intended for Lord Portmore, in the habit he first appeared at Court, on his return from France. The cane dangling from his wrist, large muff, long queue, black stock, feathered chapeau, and shoes, give him the air of\n\u003cbr\u003e \"An old and finish\u0027d fop,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All cork at heel, and feather all at top.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old lady’s habit, formed of stiff brocade, gives her the appearance of a squat pyramid, with a grotesque head at the top of it. The young one is fondling a little black boy, who on his part is playing with a petite pagoda. This miniature Othello has been said to be intended for the late Ignatius Sancho, whose talents and virtues were an honour to his colour. At the time the picture was painted, he would have been rather older than the figure, but as he was then honoured by the partiality and protection of a noble family, the painter might possibly mean to delineate what his figure had been a few years before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The little monkey, with a magnifying glass, bag-wig, solitaire, laced hat, and ruffles, is eagerly inspecting a bill of fare, with the following articles pour diner; cocks’ combs, ducks’ tongues, rabbits’ ears, fricasee of snails, grande d’?ufs buerre.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the centre of the room is a capacious china jar; in one corner a tremendous pyramid, composed of packs of cards, and on the floor close to them, a bill, inscribed “Lady Basto, Dr to John Pip, for cards — ￡300.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The room is ornamented with several pictures; the principal represents the Medicean Venus, on a pedestal, in stays and high-heeled shoes, and holding before her a hoop petticoat, somewhat larger than a fig-leaf; a Cupid paring down a fat lady to a thin proportion, and another Cupid blowing up a fire to burn a hoop petticoat, muff, bag, queue wig, \u0026amp;c. On the dexter side is another picture, representing Monsieur Desnoyer, operatically habited, dancing in a grand ballet, and surrounded by butterflies, insects evidently of the same genus with this deity of dance. On the sinister, is a drawing of exotics, consisting of queue and bag-wigs, muffs, solitaires, petticoats, French heeled shoes, and other fantastic fripperies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Beneath this is a lady in a pyramidical habit walking the Park; and as the companion picture, we have a blind man walking the streets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fire-screen is adorned with a drawing of a lady in a sedan-chair —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To conceive how she looks, you must call to your mind\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The lady you’ve seen in a lobster confined,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or a pagod in some little corner enshrined.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Hogarth made this design from the ideas of Miss Edwards, it has been said that he had no great partiality for his own performance, and that, as he never would consent to its being engraved, the drawing from which the first print was copied, was made by the connivance of one of her servants. Be that as it may, his ridicule on the absurdities of fashion — on the folly of collecting old china — cookery — card playing, \u0026amp;c. is pointed, and highly wrought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the sale of Miss Edwards’s effects at Kensington, the original picture was purchased by the father of Mr. Birch, surgeon, of Essex-street, Strand.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1452/43665.html","bookId":1368,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 2:14:59 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 2:14:59 AM"}
