She barely felt Shane’s arm around her shoulders as she sank against him. “What the hell is this?” she whispered, quivering inside. “Dear God, what?” She felt as if her soul was being shredded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some sick bastard left this for you?” Shane demanded of Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna felt rather than saw Cassie nod. She couldn’t drag her gaze from the table and its wretched display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stomach churned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat tickled the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBile crawled up her throat and she knew in that instant that she was going to throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginning to retch she frantically stumbled away from her husband, from the dining room, from the marred visage of her youngest daughter. She ran half-blind to the powder room where she heaved over the toilet, hot tears filling her eyes, her stomach emptying again and again. For the love of all that was holy, where was Allie? Where was her baby? Why had the horrid mask been left at Cassie’s apartment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new fear slithered through her: Would Cassie disappear as well? Was this a warning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few seconds she stood, bent over the toilet bowl. Until she was certain nothing else was coming up. Then, unsteadily, she flushed the toilet and stepped to the sink where she bent down again and rinsed her mouth with water from the tap. Her body’s shaking had stopped, she was no longer trembling, but the fear still gnawed at her as she splashed water over her face. A floorboard near the doorway creaked and she caught sight of Shane’s face in the reflection. A tall man, with an intimidating stature, he met her gaze. “We’ll get him,” he told her. “We’ll get the bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees threatened to buckle and she clung to the edge of the pedestal sink for support. “Promise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig arms surrounded her again, the scent of wet leather from his jacket over the smell of his aftershave and a deeper, earthier male scent. Familiar. Calming. Safe. The smells she associated with him that caused her heart to tick a little faster. Today they weren’t calming. Nothing was. Rain peppered the small window in the room, and she saw Shane holding her in the mirror’s reflection. Her face was thin and drawn, devoid of makeup. His eyebrows were pulled into a line of concern, his lips a thin, hard blade as he tried to soothe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all she could do to not break down completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want twenty-four-hour protection for Cassie,” she whispered. “And she should live here with us. We’ll get a bigger dog and have an alarm system installed and . . .” She let her voice trail off. Hadn’t she tried all those techniques ten years before? And still the monster had easily breached the walls of her fortress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take care of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow? Jenna wondered, and knew his statement was little more than a platitude, just as Cassie promising to find Allie was only to ease her mother’s mind. Well, nothing could. At least no words were the bromide for her deep-seated worries. She blinked back the damned tears that had been threatening all morning, then set her jaw. She could not, would not collapse. Not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard. Stiffened her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst things first: They had to find Allie. And she had to remain sane. Not fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past few weeks, Jenna had been so desperate to locate her daughter, so unhinged at the thought of Allie being stalked by a crazed fan, being abducted or worse, that her mind had been playing tricks on her. Twice she’d thought she’d caught a glimpse of Allie, always at a distance, but when she’d tried to call out to the woman, reach her, she’d disappeared. It had happened once in the supermarket and another time when she’d seen “Allie” getting into a car. Each time the look-alike had appeared to stare straight at her, only to ignore her and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad those sightings been tricks of her imagination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWishful thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr something deeper, a mental weakness that seemed to run in her family? Cassie’s mental state had been fragile for the past ten years, ever since the unthinkable had happened. Her grip on reality had faltered, and she claimed to have seen things that hadn’t existed. Sometimes Cassie swore she couldn’t remember hours of her life. So what about herself? Or Allie? Couldn’t they, too, be affected by the trauma they’d suffered? Couldn’t their mental states be weakened, allowing paranoia or worse to creep in and take hold? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-102.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
