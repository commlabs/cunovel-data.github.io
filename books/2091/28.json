I wanted to touch his hair, hold his hand, but I knew he wouldn\u0027t let me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luc was wrong,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t like de crescent moon; I despise it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, he took my arm and half-led, half-dragged me to the ancient Chevy parked in the driveway. The thing appeared to be at least forty years old. A little restoration would do wonders, just like the mansion. Right now the car was a mess - rusted, blotchy, no true color to speak of. Adam opened the passenger door and I balked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in,\" he said through gritted teeth, \"or I will make you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the trailer.

The seat was badly torn, as if an animal had clawed it apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car was so old, it didn\u0027t have air-conditioning. In a near-synchronized movement, we rolled down the windows. The morning was already hot enough that the wind felt good in my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not gonna tell you what happened,\" Adam murmured. \"I can\u0027t\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"can\u0027t\" stopped me. I understood that special ops were a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to your wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers tightened on the wheel. \"She\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined terrible things - things that had put the shadows in his eyes.

Why would you tell your child his mother is dead when she - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took off. Abandoned him. Left when he was not much more than a year old and never came back. She didn\u0027t want him. She hates him almost as much as she hates - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mourn snapped closed over the last word. But I could figure it out. His wife hated him. I doubted he\u0027d tell me why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t see her again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t hear from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re still married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I don\u0027t know where she is, how can I send her the divorce papers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a point.

She never loved me. We got married because...\" He shrugged and I understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t keep it in your pants. What a shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over the interior of the car. But I was unable to remain quiet for long. \"Why did you tell me you couldn\u0027t have children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. Not anymore. After Luc I - \" He fell silent, as if he could no longer find the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no such trouble. \"You were in an accident? Caught the mumps? What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a vasectomy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth fell open. I seemed to have that problem a lot lately. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t make de same mistake twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What if you met someone?

Never have another child. It\u0027s de way things are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never planned to marry again, either, knew with utter certainty I\u0027d never love anyone the way I\u0027d loved Simon. I hadn\u0027t wanted a baby with him; I definitely didn\u0027t want one with anyone else. So why did Adam\u0027s words bother me so much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I smelled a lie in there somewhere; I just wasn\u0027t sure where. Perhaps it was the lie of omission. He had another life, a family I didn\u0027t even know about And if he\u0027d lied about that, he\u0027d probably lied about something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me about Luc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life in de swamp is different from my life with my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. \"And I\u0027m part of your life in the swamp?

You don\u0027t want your precious son being contaminated by the trampy woman you\u0027re screwing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw tightened. \"That isn\u0027t what I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to.\" I crossed my arms and stared out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do anything to keep Luc from being hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a glare. \"You think I\u0027d hurt him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on purpose. But - \" He lifted his hand from the steering wheel, then lowered it. \"He wants a mother.

A little cabin in de swamp? Drive a car pool? Make bag lunches? Soccer games and Little League?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hesitated, he nodded. \"That\u0027s what I thought. So I keep him away. Why get his hopes up? He\u0027s gonna have a hard enough life as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is his life going to be hard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just de way Me is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I think I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him as he stared out the windshield. \"You say the strangest things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to tell anyone about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spread my hands wide. \"Who would I tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows he\u0027s my son. I want to keep it that way. People around here, they think I\u0027m nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder why,\" I said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me. \"Luc should have as normal of a life as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wouldn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Me isn\u0027t normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I have responsibilities. Things I have to do - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought broke through my confusion. \"Are you still in the army? Some super secret agent crap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, exactly, do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother to answer, which only made me more suspicious. But his next words hurt so much, I forgot all about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to see Luc again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t plan on seeing Adam again, either. Just because I didn\u0027t want children didn\u0027t mean I was going to take kindly to being told I wasn\u0027t allowed near one. Adam was making me feel bad, and I already felt bad enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned off the main road and slowed at the sight of a car parked in front of the mansion. Cassandra sat on the porch. As we pulled up she stood, hand raised to shield her eyes from the bright morning sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my watch. Seven forty-five. Damn, I\u0027d told her I\u0027d call by 7:00 A.M. and let her know I was okay. I was surprised Detective Sullivan wasn\u0027t here, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is that?\" Adam murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She don\u0027t look like a voodoo priestess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what does a voodoo priestess look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra\u0027s face flooded with relief when she saw me. Her gaze went to Adam, and her eyebrows shot up. I\u0027m sure he had that effect on all the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out of the car. \"Sorry. I forgot to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to introduce Adam, and he drove away. I was left gaping at the taillights of his Chevy. Sure, I\u0027d planned to blow him off, but he hadn\u0027t even given me the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antisocial much?\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t the loup-garou,\" I blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer only reaction was a slight lifting of her dark eyebrows. \"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I touched him with your knife, and he didn\u0027t explode.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not into flames anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirked. \"You had sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See that in your crystal ball?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t have to. I can tell by the way you watched him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" I mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it? So where were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to tell her, then remembered Adam\u0027s admonition about Luc. Not that I\u0027d promised anything. Not that I owed Adam anything. Not that Cassandra was any type of threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again I had no idea whom I could trust and whom I couldn\u0027t I\u0027d thought Adam and I had something - if not love, well, at least lust and extreme like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscovering he had a son, that he was, technically, married, had shaken my confidence. Go figure. Having him say he didn\u0027t want me near his child hurt But I wasn\u0027t going to make myself feel any better by telling Cassandra. I don\u0027t think anything would make me feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana?\" Cassandra pressed. \"Where were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the swamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. We had been, most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered something else about Luc - he wasn\u0027t supposed to exist. I\u0027d found no record of his birth at all. Had I missed it? Had it been lost, stolen, misplaced? I was so confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of vehicles turning off the main highway made both Cassandra and I glance up. A delivery truck and an unmarked police car rattled down the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sullivan,\" Cassandra murmured. She didn\u0027t sound pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Malone.\" He nodded at me, then Cassandra. \"Priestess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a sarcastic twist on the title and Cassandra\u0027s eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better watch it or she\u0027ll turn you into a toad,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wish I could,\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan didn\u0027t appear worried. \"I\u0027d be happy to call you Miss, Mrs., or Ms. if I knew your last name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you haven\u0027t been able to uncover that information with your superior detecting skills?\" Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been a little busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your last name?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need one. \u0027Priestess Cassandra\u0027 sets me apart. It isn\u0027t as if there are two in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head. She didn\u0027t want to tell me. How interesting. I never would have thought Cassandra had something to hide. Maybe everyone did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one of you is Malone?\" the deliveryman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me.\" I took the clipboard he offered and signed next to my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stuff from Frank had arrived. Thank goodness. In less than a week the crescent moon would rise and now I\u0027d be ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Sullivan asked as the delivery guy unloaded a cart with a long, thin box atop two shorter fatter ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cage, tree stands, tranquilizer gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a permit for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped in the middle of opening the box on the top. \"I was told the gun laws in Louisiana are... lenient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan scowled. \"You got that right. But trapping an animal and transporting it across state lines is a different matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell. I hadn\u0027t thought of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily Frank had. On top of the dart gun lay documents, all made out and stamped nice and legal, signed by the governor and giving me the right to take pretty much anything anywhere I wanted to. Frank might be an annoying pain, but he was an organized, think-ahead, rich annoying pain with a lot of connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed the papers to Sullivan. Frustration washed over his face. He handed them back to me with a scowl. \"Did you ever tell Adam Ruelle I wanted to talk to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already had this conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He still hasn\u0027t contacted me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. Adam wasn\u0027t going to call the detective. Not in this lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you call me if it wasn\u0027t about Ruelle?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten about the call I\u0027d placed, the message I\u0027d left, but I remembered the question I\u0027d had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever identify the man who was strangled in the swamp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that strange?\" Cassandra murmured. \"Shouldn\u0027t someone be searching for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eventually. Maybe.\" Sullivan shrugged. \"You\u0027d be surprised how many John Does there are in the world. Especially around here. Speaking of which, we never found Charlie Wagner\u0027s body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried very hard not to look at Cassandra. Probably as hard as she was trying not to look at me. The detective glanced back and forth between us. His eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could ask us questions we wouldn\u0027t answer, I asked one of my own. \"The St. Tammany police thought there was a rabies problem in the swamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something. My boss called in a specialist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of specialist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been a problem in several states with a new strain of rabies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Cassandra murmured. \"Funny we didn\u0027t hear about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They try to keep information of that nature quiet. People panic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t imagine why,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guy should be here in a couple days. He\u0027ll do his thing, and then we can concentrate on our other problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who strangled a stranger and who\u0027s stealing dead bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squinted at Cassandra as he said the latter. She just rolled her eyes and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should wait to do your trapping until our rabies expert is finished,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if my wolf is the one with the rabies problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I kind of thought he was - if you considered rabies was a euphemism for the curse of the crescent moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027d definitely better back off. You don\u0027t want rabies, Ms. Malone. Even with the new medicines, it isn\u0027t pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, I didn\u0027t want to be baying at the moon, either. I wasn\u0027t going to take any chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll wait until I give the go-ahead before you move forward with... ?\" Sullivan made a vague motion toward the cage and the dart gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great I\u0027ll be in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective climbed into his car and rumbled down the drive toward the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra cleared her throat. When I glanced at her, she lifted a dark brow. \"You really plan to wait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-28.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
