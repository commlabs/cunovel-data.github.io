This monster was truly tricky to deal with. Not only was it immune to fire based attacks, but the purple flame attacks it sent out were extremely fierce. If a normal Divine Phoenix Island disciple had run into this spook fellow, they would have been unable to deal with a single attack.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm was a world of fire and ice.

For a period, crushed rock and magma scattered in all directions, filling the sky. From the front of the fiery rock monster, half of its body had been exploded into bits. Lin Ming’s concentrated his true essence into protecting his body and resisting the shattered rocks and magma that struck him. At the same time, he released his perception, accurately sifting through the tens of thousands of fragments until he found the true body of the Fallen Star Flame.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There it is!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming saw that around 100 feet away, there was a palm-sized ball of purple flame; it had a very glum expression.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming waved his sleeve and his body was like a fish as it passed through the 100 feet distance, immediately grabbing the Fallen Star Flame.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Fallen Star Flame instinctively felt a deep and abiding fear, wanting to escape.

In an instant, a hole had burned through the azure true essence that protected his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Fallen Star Flame has such a strong corrosive strength!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were many special Flame Essences and Thunder Souls that were born in special conditions and locations, thus obtaining different properties. For instance, the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder was born in desolate lands that were filled with blood and death, so it had have bloodthirsty characteristics.

There hadn’t been a description of just what sort of properties it had.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming first drew up a few dozen azure runes, letting them all fall onto the Fallen Star Flame.

Many runes were destroyed, but there were a number of runes that managed to stick onto the Fallen Star Flame. Finally, the layer of runes became thicker and thicker and the light of the Fallen Star Flame became increasingly dim, until it was completely sealed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming let out a long breath.

Now was not a good time to absorb the Fallen Star Flame. After all, it was still a medium-grade earth-step Flame Essence. With Lin Ming’s current strength, he would just barely be able to absorb it. Not only that, but there were boundless dangers within the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm and there was no one here to stand guard over him.
