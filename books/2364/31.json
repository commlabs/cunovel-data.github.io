Philip needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe calls and get-well cards kept pouring in, and Marian Bell proved to be a blessing. She was self-effacing and never got in the way. \"Don\u0027t worry about them, Mrs. Adler. I\u0027ll handle them, if you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Marian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Ellerbee called several times, but Philip refused to take his calls. \"I don\u0027t want to talk to anyone,\" he told Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Stanton had been right about the pain. It was excruciating. Philip tried to avoid taking pain pills until he could no longer stand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was always at his side. \"We\u0027re going to get you the best doctors in the world, darling. There must be someone who can fix your hand. I heard about a doctor in Switzerland...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip shook his head. \"It\u0027s no use.\" He looked at his bandaged hand. \"I\u0027m a cripple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk like that,\" Lara said fiercely. \"There are a thousand things you can still do. I blame myself. If I hadn\u0027t gone to Reno that day, if I had been with you at the concert, this never would have happened. If...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip smiled wryly. \"You wanted me to stay home more. Well, now I have nowhere else to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said huskily, \"Someone said, \u0027Be careful what you wish for, because you might get it.\u0027 I did want you to stay home, but not like this. I can\u0027t stand to see you in pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about me,\" Philip said. \"I just have to work a few things out in my mind. It\u0027s all happened so suddenly. I...I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve quite realized it, yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller came to the penthouse with some contracts. \"Hello, Philip. How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" Philip snapped. \"I feel just wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a stupid question. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mind me,\" Philip apologized. \"I haven\u0027t been myself lately.\" He pounded his right hand against the chair. \"If the bastard had only cut my right hand. There are a dozen left-handed concertos I could have played.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Keller remembered the conversation at the party. \"Half a dozen composers wrote concertos for the left hand. There\u0027s one by Demuth, Franz Schmidt, Korngold, and a beautiful concerto by Ravel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Paul Martin had been there and heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Stanton came to the penthouse to see Philip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, he removed the bandage, exposing a long angry scar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you flex your hand at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip tried. It was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the pain?\" Dr. Stanton asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bad, but I don\u0027t want to take any more of those damned pain pills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave another prescription anyway. You can take them if you have to. Believe me, the pain will stop in the next few weeks.\" He rose to leave. \"I really am sorry. I happen to be a big fan of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy my records,\" Philip said curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian Bell made a suggestion to Lara. \"Do you think it might help Mr. Adler if a therapist came to work on his hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara thought about it. \"We can try. Let\u0027s see what happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara suggested it to Philip, he shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. What\u0027s the point? The doctor said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctors can be wrong,\" Lara said firmly. \"We\u0027re going to try everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day a young therapist appeared at the apartment. Lara brought him in to Philip. \"This is Mr. Rossman. He works at Columbia Hospital. He\u0027s going to try to help you, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" Philip said bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s take a look at that hand, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip held out his hand. Rossman examined it carefully. \"Looks as though there\u0027s been quite a bit of muscle damage, but we\u0027ll see what we can do. Can you move your fingers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not much motion, is there? Let\u0027s try to exercise it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unbelievably painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey worked for half an hour, and at the end of that time Rossman said, \"I\u0027ll come back tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Philip said. \"Don\u0027t bother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara had come into the room. \"Philip, won\u0027t you try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried,\" he snarled. \"Don\u0027t you understand? My hand is dead. Nothing\u0027s going to bring it back to life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip...\" Her eyes filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Philip said. \"I just...Give me time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night Lara was awakened by the sound of the piano. She got out of bed and quietly walked over to the entrance of the drawing room. Philip was in his robe, seated at the piano, his right hand softly playing. He looked up when he saw Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry if I woke you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara moved toward him. \"Darling...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a big joke, isn\u0027t it? You married a concert pianist and you wound up with a cripple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arms around him and held him close. \"You\u0027re not a cripple. There are so many things you can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop being a goddamn Pollyanna!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I just meant...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Forgive me, I\" - he held up his mutilated hand - \"I just can\u0027t get used to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come back to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You go ahead. I\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up all night, thinking about his future, and he wondered angrily, What future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara and Philip had dinner together every evening, and after dinner they read or watched television and then went to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said apologetically, \"I know I\u0027m not being much of a husband, Lara. I just...I just don\u0027t feel like sex. Believe me, it has nothing to do with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sat up in bed, her voice trembling. \"I didn\u0027t marry you for your body. I married you because I was wildly head over heels in love with you. I still am. If we never make love again, it will be fine with me. All I want is for you to hold me and love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love you,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvitations to dinner parties and charity events came in constantly, but Philip refused them all. He did not want to leave the apartment. \"You go,\" he would tell Lara. \"It\u0027s important to your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing is more important to me than you. We\u0027ll have a nice quiet dinner at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara saw to it that their chef prepared all of Philip\u0027s favorite dishes. He had no appetite. Lara arranged to hold her meetings at the penthouse. When it was necessary for her to go out during the day, she would say to Marian, \"I\u0027ll be gone for a few hours. Keep an eye on Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" Marian promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning Lara said, \"Darling, I hate to leave you, but I have to go to Cleveland for a day. Will you be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Philip said. \"I\u0027m not helpless. Please go. Don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian brought in some letters she had finished answering for Philip. \"Would you like to sign these, Mr. Adler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said, \"Sure. It\u0027s a good thing I\u0027m right-handed, isn\u0027t it?\" There was a bitter edge to his voice. He looked at Marian and said, \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to take it out on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian said quietly, \"I know that, Mr. Adler. Don\u0027t you think it would be a good idea for you to go outside and see some friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friends are all working,\" Philip snapped. \"They\u0027re musicians. They\u0027re busy playing concerts. How can you be so stupid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stormed out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian stood there looking after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later Philip walked back into the office. Marian was at the typewriter. \"Marian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up. \"Yes, Mr. Adler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please forgive me. I\u0027m not myself. I didn\u0027t mean to be rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down opposite her. \"The reason I\u0027m not going out,\" Philip said, \"is that I feel like a freak. I\u0027m sure that everybody\u0027s going to be staring at my hand. I don\u0027t want anyone\u0027s pity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching him, saying nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been very kind, and I appreciate it, I really do. But there\u0027s nothing anyone can do. You know the expression. \u0027The bigger they are, the harder they fall\u0027? Well, I was big, Marian - really big. Everybody came to hear me play...kings and queens and...\" He broke off. \"People all over the world heard my music. I\u0027ve given recitals in China and Russia and India and Germany.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice choked up, and tears began rolling down his cheeks. \"Have you noticed I cry a lot lately?\" he said. He was fighting to control himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian said softly, \"Please don\u0027t. Everything\u0027s going to be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Nothing\u0027s going to be all right. Nothing! I\u0027m a goddamn cripple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that. Mrs. Adler is right, you know. There are a hundred things you can do. When you get over this pain, you\u0027ll begin to do them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip took out a handkerchief and wiped his eyes. \"Jesus Christ, I\u0027m becoming a damn crybaby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it helps you,\" Marian said, \"do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at her and smiled. \"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a pretty wise twenty-six, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I just know what you\u0027re going through, and I\u0027d give anything if it hadn\u0027t happened. But it has happened, and I know that you\u0027re going to figure out the best way to deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wasting your time here,\" Philip said. \"You should have been a shrink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to make a drink for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. Are you interested in a game of backgammon?\" Philip asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love it, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re going to be my backgammon partner, you\u0027d better start calling me Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that time on, they played backgammon every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara received a telephone call from Terry Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara, I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara readied herself. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Nevada Gaming Commission has voted to suspend your gambling license until further investigation. You may be facing criminal charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a shock. She thought of Paul Martin\u0027s words. \"Don\u0027t worry. They can\u0027t prove anything.\" \"Isn\u0027t there something we can do about it, Terry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for the present. Just sit tight. I\u0027m working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara told Keller the news, he said, \"My God! We\u0027re counting on the cash flow from the casino to pay off the mortgages on three buildings. Are they going to reinstate your license?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was thoughtful. \"All right. We\u0027ll sell the Chicago Hotel and use the equity to pay the mortgage on the Houston property. The real estate market has gone to hell. A lot of banks and savings and loans are in deep trouble. Drexel Burnham Lambert has folded. It\u0027s the end of Milken honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will turn around,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had better turn around fast. I\u0027ve been getting calls from the banks about our loans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Lara said confidently. \"If you owe a bank a million dollars, they own you. If you owe a bank a hundred million dollars, you own them. They can\u0027t afford to let anything happen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, an article appeared in Business Week. It was headlined: CAMERON EMPIRE SHAKY - LARA CAMERON FACING POSSIBLE CRIMINAL INDICTMENT IN RENO. CAN THE IRON BUTTERFLY KEEP HER EMPIRE TOGETHER?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara slammed her fist against the magazine. \"How dare they print that? I\u0027m going to sue them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller said, \"Not a great idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said earnestly, \"Howard, Cameron Towers is almost fully rented, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventy percent, so far, and climbing. Southern Insurance has taken twenty floors, and International Investment Banking has taken ten floors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the building is finished, it will throw off enough money to take care of all our problems. How far away are we from completion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s voice was filled with excitement. \"Look what we\u0027ll have then. The biggest skyscraper in the world! It\u0027s going to be beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the framed sketch of it behind her desk. It showed a towering glass-sheathed monolith, whose facets reflected the other buildings around it. On the lower floors were a promenade and atrium, with expensive shops. Above were apartments and Lara\u0027s offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have a big publicity promotion,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\" He frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I was just thinking about Steve Murchison. He wanted that site pretty bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we beat him to it, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Keller said slowly. \"We beat him to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sent for Jerry Townsend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerry, I want to do something special for the opening of Cameron Towers. Any ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a great idea. The opening is September tenth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t that ring a bell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s my birthday...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" A smile lit up Jerry Townsend\u0027s face. \"Why don\u0027t we give you a big birthday party to celebrate the completion of the skyscraper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was thoughtful for a moment. \"I like it. It\u0027s a wonderful idea. We\u0027ll invite everybody! We\u0027ll make a noise that will be heard around the world. Jerry, I want you to make up a guest list. Two hundred people. I want you to handle it personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTownsend grinned. \"You\u0027ve got it. I\u0027ll give you the guest list to approve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara slammed her fist down on the magazine again. \"We\u0027re going to show them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Mrs. Adler,\" Marian said. \"I have the secretary of the National Builders Association on line three. You haven\u0027t responded to their invitation for the dinner Friday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them I can\u0027t make it,\" Lara said. \"Give them my apologies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" Marian left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said, \"Lara, you can\u0027t turn yourself into a hermit because of me. It\u0027s important for you to go to those things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing is more important than my being here with you. That funny little man who married us in Paris said, \u0027For better or for worse.\u0027\" She frowned. \"At least I think that\u0027s what he said. I don\u0027t speak French.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip smiled. \"I want you to know how much I appreciate you. I feel like I\u0027m putting you through hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara moved closer to him. \"Wrong word,\" she said. \"Heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was getting dressed. Lara was helping him with the buttons on his shirt. Philip looked in the mirror. \"I look like a damned hippie,\" he said. \"I need a haircut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to have Marian make an appointment with your barber?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No. I\u0027m sorry, Lara. I\u0027m just not ready to go out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Philip\u0027s barber and a manicurist appeared at the apartment. Philip was taken aback. \"What\u0027s all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Mohammed won\u0027t go to the mountain, the mountain comes to Mohammed. They\u0027ll be here every week for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a wonder,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t seen nothin\u0027 yet.\" Lara grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, a tailor arrived with some sample swatches for suits and shirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Philip asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said, \"You\u0027re the only man I know who has six pairs of tails, four dinner jackets, and two suits. I think it\u0027s time we got you a proper wardrobe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Philip protested. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he allowed himself to be fitted for the suits and shirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days later a custom shoemaker arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" Philip asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time you had some new shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I\u0027m not going out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, baby. But when you do, your shoes will be ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip held her close. \"I don\u0027t deserve you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I keep telling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in a meeting at the office. Howard Keller was saying, \"We\u0027re losing the shopping mall in Los Angeles. The banks have decided to call in the loans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re doing it,\" Keller said. \"We\u0027re overleveraged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can pay the loans off by borrowing on one of the other buildings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller said, patiently, \"Lara, you\u0027re already leveraged to the hilt. You have a sixty-million-dollar payment coming up on the skyscraper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, but completion is only four months away now. We can roll the loan over. The building\u0027s on schedule, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Keller was studying her thoughtfully. It was a question she never would have asked one year ago. Then she would have known exactly where everything stood. \"I think it might be better if you spent more time here in the office,\" Keller told her. \"Too many things are becoming unraveled. There are some decisions that only you can make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara nodded. \"All right,\" she said reluctantly. \"I\u0027ll be in tomorrow morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"William Ellerbee is on the telephone for you,\" Marian announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I can\u0027t talk to him.\" Philip watched her as she returned to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Ellerbee. Mr. Adler is not available just now. Can I take a message?\" She listened a moment. \"I\u0027ll tell him. Thank you.\" She replaced the receiver and looked up at Philip. \"He\u0027s really anxious to have lunch with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He probably wants to talk about the commissions he\u0027s not getting anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably right,\" Marian said mildly. \"I\u0027m sure he must hate you because you were attacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said quietly, \"Sorry. Is that the way I sounded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you put up with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian smiled. \"It\u0027s not that difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day William Ellerbee called again. Philip was out of the room. Marian spoke to Ellerbee for a few minutes, then went to find Philip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Mr. Ellerbee,\" Marian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time tell him to stop calling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should tell him yourself,\" Marian said. \"You\u0027re having lunch with him Thursday at one o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He suggested Le Cirque, but I thought a smaller restaurant might be better.\" She looked at the pad in her hand. \"He\u0027s going to meet you at Fu\u0027s at one. I\u0027ll arrange for Max to drive you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was staring at her, furious. \"You made a lunch date for me without asking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said calmly, \"If I had asked you, you wouldn\u0027t have gone. You can fire me if you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at her for a long moment, and then he broke into a slow smile. \"You know something? I haven\u0027t had Chinese food in a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara arrived from the office, Philip said, \"I\u0027m going out for lunch on Thursday with Ellerbee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful, darling! When did you decide that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marian decided it for me. She thought it would be a good idea for me to get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" But you wouldn\u0027t go out when I suggested it. \"That was very thoughtful of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. She\u0027s quite a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been stupid, Lara thought. I shouldn\u0027t have thrown them together like this. And Philip is so vulnerable right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the moment when Lara knew she had to get rid of Marian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara arrived home the following day, Philip and Marian were playing backgammon in the game room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur game, Lara thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I beat you if you keep rolling doubles?\" Philip was saying, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara stood in the doorway watching. She had not heard Philip laugh in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian looked up and saw her. \"Good evening, Mrs. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip sprang to his feet. \"Hello, darling.\" He kissed her. \"She\u0027s beating the pants off me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot if I can help it, Lara thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you need me tonight, Mrs. Adler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Marian. You can run along. I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Marian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched her leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s good company,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara stroked his cheek. \"I\u0027m glad, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s everything at the office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" She had no intention of burdening Philip with her problems. She would have to fly to Reno and talk to the Gaming Commission again. If she were forced to, she would find a way to survive their cutting off the gambling at the hotel, but it would make it a lot easier if she could dissuade them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to start spending more time at the office. Howard can\u0027t make all the decisions himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to Reno in the next day or two,\" Lara said. \"Why don\u0027t you come with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip shook his head. \"I\u0027m not ready yet.\" He looked at his crippled left hand. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, darling. I shouldn\u0027t be gone more than two or three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning when Marian Bell arrived for work, Lara was waiting for her. Philip was still asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marian...you know the diamond bracelet that Mr. Adler gave me for my birthday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mrs. Adler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you see it last?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped to think. \"It was on the dressing table in your bedroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you did see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes. Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid there is. The bracelet is missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian was staring at her. \"Missing? Who could have...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve questioned the staff here. They don\u0027t know anything about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I call the police and...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That won\u0027t be necessary. I don\u0027t want to do anything that might embarrass you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you? For your sake, I think it would be best if we dropped the whole matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian was staring at Lara in shock. \"You know I didn\u0027t take that bracelet, Mrs. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know anything of the kind. You\u0027ll have to leave.\" And she hated herself for what she was doing. But no one is going to take Philip away from me. No one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Philip came down to breakfast, Lara said, \"By the way, I\u0027m getting a new secretary to work here at the apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip looked at her in surprise. \"What happened to Marian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She quit. She was offered a...a job in San Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Lara in surprise. \"Oh. That\u0027s too bad. I thought she liked it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she did, but we wouldn\u0027t want to stand in her way, would we?\" Forgive me, Lara thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not,\" Philip said. \"I\u0027d like to wish her luck. Is she...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said, \"I guess I\u0027ll have to find a new backgammon partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When things settle down a bit, I\u0027ll be here for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip and William Ellerbee were seated in a corner table at Fu\u0027s restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllerbee said, \"It\u0027s so good to see you, Philip. I\u0027ve been calling you, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I\u0027m sorry. I haven\u0027t felt like talking to anyone, Bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope they catch the bastard who did this to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police have been good enough to explain to me that muggings are not a high priority in their lives. They equate it just below lost cats. They\u0027ll never catch him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllerbee said hesitantly, \"I understand that you\u0027re not going to be able to play again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand right.\" Philip held up his crippled hand. \"It\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllerbee leaned forward and said earnestly, \"But you\u0027re not, Philip. You still have your whole life ahead of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teaching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a wry smile on Philip\u0027s lips. \"It\u0027s ironic, isn\u0027t it? I had thought about doing that one day when I was through giving concerts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllerbee said quietly, \"Well, that day is here, isn\u0027t it? I took the liberty of talking to the head of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. They would give anything to have you teach there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip frowned. \"That would mean my moving up there. Lara\u0027s headquarters are in New York.\" He shook his head. \"I couldn\u0027t do that to her. You don\u0027t know how wonderful she\u0027s been to me, Bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s practically given up her business to take care of me. She\u0027s the most thoughtful, considerate woman I\u0027ve ever known. I\u0027m crazy about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip, would you at least think about the offer from Eastman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them I appreciate it, but I\u0027m afraid the answer is no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you change your mind, will you let me know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip nodded. \"You\u0027ll be the first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Philip returned to the penthouse, Lara had gone to the office. He wandered around the apartment, restless. He thought about his conversation with Ellerbee. I would love to teach, Philip thought, but I can\u0027t ask Lara to move to Rochester, and I can\u0027t go there without her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the front door open. \"Lara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Marian. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, Philip. I didn\u0027t know anyone was here. I came to return my key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d be in San Francisco by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, puzzled. \"San Francisco? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that where your new job is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no new job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Lara said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian suddenly understood. \"I see. She didn\u0027t tell you why she fired me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fired you? She told me that you quit...that you had a better offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said slowly, \"I think you\u0027d better sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat across from each other. \"What\u0027s going on here?\" Philip asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian took a deep breath. \"I think your wife believes that I...that I had designs on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She accused me of stealing the diamond bracelet you gave her, as an excuse to fire me. I\u0027m sure she has it put away somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe this,\" Philip protested. \"Lara would never do anything like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would do anything to hold on to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was studying her, bewildered. \"I...I don\u0027t know what to say. Let me talk to Lara and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Please don\u0027t. It might be better if you didn\u0027t let her know I was here.\" She rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll find another job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marian, if there\u0027s anything I can do...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure. Take care of yourself, Philip.\" And she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip watched her leave, disturbed. He couldn\u0027t believe that Lara could be guilty of such a deception, and he wondered why she hadn\u0027t told him about it. Perhaps, he thought, Marian did steal the bracelet, and Lara had not wanted to upset him. Marian was lying. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-31.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
