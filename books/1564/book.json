But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3.jpg","author":"J.K.
