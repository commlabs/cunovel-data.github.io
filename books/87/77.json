It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e3. Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven?
