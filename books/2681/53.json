as it had once been, a hundred years earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside those fine buildings, many of the high rooms with their long windows had been subdivided by cheap partitions to form offices for lesser officials and meeting rooms for unimportant groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a subcommittee of a subcommittee, the Medals (Clandestine Actions) Working Party met in a windowless room fifteen feet square with a vast, cold fireplace that occupied half of one wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Fortescue from M16 was in the chair, wearing a striped suit, striped shirt, and striped tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Special Operations Executive was represented by John Graves from the Ministry of Economic Warfare, which had theoretically supervised SOE throughout the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the other civil servants on the committee, Graves wore the Whitehall uniform of black jacket and gray striped trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bishop of Marlborough was there in a purple clerical shirt, no doubt to give the moral dimension to the business of honoring men for killing other men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Algernon \"Nobby\" Clarke, an intelligence officer, was the only member of the committee who had seen action in the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTea was served by the committee\u0027s secretary, and a plate of biscuits was passed around while the men deliberated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was midmorning when they came to the case of the Jackdaws of Reims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Graves said, \"There were six women on this team, and only two came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they destroyed the telephone exchange at Sainte-Cecile, which was also the local Gestapo headquarters.\" \"Women?\" said the bishop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you say six women?\" \"Yes.\" \"My goodness me.\" His tone was disapproving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why women?\" \"The telephone exchange was heavily guarded, but they got in by posing as cleaners.\" \"I see.\" Nobby Clarke, who had spent most of the morning chain-smoking in silence, now said, \"After the liberation of Paris, I interrogated a Major Goedel, who had been aide to Rommel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told me they had been virtually paralyzed by the breakdown in communications on D day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a significant factor in the success of the invasion, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea a handful of girls were responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should think we\u0027re talking about the Mi!itary Cross, aren\u0027t we?\" \"Perhaps,\" said Fortescue, and his manner became prissy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However, there were discipline problems with this group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn official complaint was entered against the leader, Major Clairet, after she insulted a Guards officer.\" \"Insulted?\" said the bishop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" \"There was a row in a bar, and I\u0027m afraid she told him to fuck off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaving your presence, Bishop.\" \"My goodness me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t sound like the kind of person who should be held up as a hero to the next generation.\" \"Exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lesser decoration than the Military Cross, then-the MBE, perhaps.\" Nobby Clarke spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree,\" he said mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all, if this woman had been a milksop she probably wouldn\u0027t have been able to blow up a telephone exchange under the noses of the Gestapo.\" Fortescue was irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unusual for him to encounter opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated people who were not intimidated by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The consensus of the meeting seems to be against you.\" Clarke frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I presume I can put in a minority recommendation,\" he said with stubborn patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" said Fortescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though I doubt if there\u0027s much point.\" Clarke drew on his cigarette thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" \"The Minister will have some knowledge of one or two of the individuals on our list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn those cases he will follow his own inclinations, regardless of our recommendations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all other cases he will do as we suggest, having himself no interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the committee is not unanimous, he will accept the recommendation of the majority.\" \"I see,\" said Clarke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same, I should like the record to show that I dissented from the committee and recommended the Military Cross for Major Clairet.\" Fortescue looked at the secretary, the only woman in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure of that, please, Miss Gregory.\" \"Very good,\" she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClarke stubbed out his cigarette and lit another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the end of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRAU WALTRAUD FRANCK came home happy.She had managed to buy a neck of mutton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first meat she had seen for a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had walked from her suburban home into the bombed city center of Cologne and had stood in line outside the butcher shop all morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had also forced herself to smile when the butcher, Herr Beckmann, fondled her behind; for if she had objected, he would have been \"sold out\" to her ever afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she could put up with Beckmann\u0027s wandering hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would get three days of meals out of a neck of mutton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m back!\" she sang out as she entered the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were at school, but Dieter was at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the precious meat in the pantry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would save it for tonight, when the children would be here to share it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor lunch, she and Dieter would have cabbage soup and black bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, darling!\" she said brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband sat at the window, motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piratical black patch covered one eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had on one of his beautiful old suits, but it hung loosely on his skinny frame, and he wore no tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to dress him nicely every morning, but she had never mastered the tying of a man\u0027s tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face wore a vacant expression, and a dribble of saliva hung from his open mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not reply to her greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was used to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess what?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a neck of mutton!\" He stared at her with his good eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bent and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have a meaty stew for supper tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAren\u0027t we lucky!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT AFTERNOON, FLICK and Paul go married in a little church in Chelsea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a simple ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe war in Europe was over, and Hitler was dead, but the Japanese were fiercely defending Okinawa, and wartime austerity continued to cramp the style of Londoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick and Paul both wore their uniforms: wedding dress material was very hard to find, and Flick as a widow did not want to wear white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy Thwaite gave Flick away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby was matron of honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not be bridesmaid because she was already married-to Jim, the firearms instructor from the Finishing School, who was sitting in the second row of pews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s father, General Chancellor, was best man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still stationed in London, and Flick had got to know him quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the reputation of an ogre in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emilitary, but to Flick he was a sweetheart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso in the church was Mademoiselle Jeanne Lemas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been taken to Ravensbrueck concentration camp, with young Marie; and Marie had died there, but somehow Jeanne Lemas had survived, and Percy Thwaite had pulled a hundred strings to get her to London for the wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in the third row, wearing a cloche hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Claude Bouler had also survived, but Diana and Maude had both died in Ravensbrueck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she died, Diana had become a leader in the camp, according to Mademoiselle Lemas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrading on the German weakness of showing deference to aristocracy, she had fearlessly confronted the camp commandant to complain about conditions and demand better treatment for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not achieved much, but her nerve and optimism had raised the spirits of the starving inmates, and several survivors credited her with giving them the will to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding service was short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over, and Flick and Paul were husband and wife, they simply turned around and stood at the front of the church to receive congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s mother was there, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow the general had managed to get his wife on a transatlantic flying boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had arrived late last night, and now Flick met her for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked Flick up and down, obviously wondering whether this girl was good enough to be the wife of her wonderful son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick felt mildly put out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she told herself this was natural in a proud mother and kissed Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChancellor\u0027s cheek with warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were going to live in Boston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul would take up the reins of his educational-records business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick planned to finish her doctorate, then teach American youngsters about French culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five-day voyage across the Atlantic would be their honeymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s ma was there in a hat she had bought in 1938.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried, even though it was the second time she had seen her daughter married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last person in the small congregation to kiss Flick was her brother, Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one more thing Flick needed to make her happiness perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her arm still around Mark, she turned to her mother, who had not spoken to him for five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Ma,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s Mark.\" Mark looked terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa hesitated for a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she opened her arms and said, \"Hello, Mark.\" \"Oh, Ma,\" he said, and he hugged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, they all walked out into the sunshine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM THE OFFICIAL HISTORY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women did not normally organize sabotage; but Pearl Witherington, a trained British courier, took over and ran an active Maquis of some two thousand men in Berry with gallantry and distinction after the Gestapo arrested her organizer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was strongly recommended for an MC [Military Cross], for which women were held ineligible; and received instead a civil MBE, which she returned, observing she had done nothing civil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-M.
