The room was elaborately furnished in an Italian style and quiet save for a mechanical whir from outside an open door, which led to the second-floor hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped from the back passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Greek fire machines whizzed passed in the hall, spewing mist. A pall hung heavy in the room, evidence that the robots had already visited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re quickly basting this house,\" Thorvaldsen said as he moved to the hall door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just about to caution him to stop when the Dane stepped out and a new voice-male, foreign-shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen froze, then slowly raised his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEly crept close to her ear. \"One of the troops. He told Henrik to halt and raise his hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen kept his head toward the guard, who apparently was positioned to their right, without a way to see inside the room. She\u0027d wondered about the troops, hoping that they\u0027d been evacuated when the machines started their patrol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore loud words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants to know if he\u0027s alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE AND CASSIOPEIA CLAMBERED DOWN THE INCLINE IN their wet clothes. Malone buttoned his shirt as they descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have mentioned that the guns were duds,\" Cassiopeia said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when would I have done that?\" He hopped over rocks and hastened down the steep slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaths came fast. He certainly wasn\u0027t thirty years old anymore, but his forty-eight-year-old bones weren\u0027t totally out of shape. \"I didn\u0027t want Viktor to even sense we knew anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t. Why\u0027d you give up your gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had to play his game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an odd bird,\" she said to him, as they found level ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take that as a compliment, coming from someone who traipsed around Venice with a bow and arrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house lay a football field away. He still saw no one roaming the exterior and no movement inside, past the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to check something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raced toward the chopper and leaped into the rear compartment. He found the weapons locker. Four AK-74s stood upright, ammunition clips stacked beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examined them. \"All blanks.\" Barrel plugs had been carefully inserted to accommodate the phony rounds and allow the cartridges to be ejected. \"Thorough little cuss. I\u0027ll give him that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the gun he\u0027d brought from Italy and checked the magazine. Five live rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia grabbed an assault rifle and popped in a clip. \"Nobody else knows these are useless. They\u0027ll do for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for one of the AK-74s. \"I agree. Perception is everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA AND VIKTOR EMERGED FROM THE POOL. MALONE AND Vitt were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the guns lay on the sandy floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Malone\u0027s a problem,\" she made clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to worry,\" Viktor said. \"I owe him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE LISTENED AS THE TROOPER IN THE HALL CONTINUED to bark orders at Thorvaldsen, the voice coming closer to the doorway. Lyndsey\u0027s face froze in panic and Ely quickly clamped a hand over the man\u0027s mouth and dragged him to the other side of a poster bed, where they crouched out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a coolness that surprised her, she locked her gaze on a Chinese porcelain statuette resting on the dresser. She grabbed it and slipped behind the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the hinge crack she saw the guard enter the bedchamber. As he stepped clear, she planted the statue into the nape of his neck. He staggered and she finished him off with another head blow, then snatched the rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen darted close and retrieved the side arm. \"I was hoping you\u0027d improvise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping these men were gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEly brought Lyndsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good job with him,\" she told Ely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has the backbone of a banana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied the AK-74. She\u0027d learned about handguns, but assault rifles were another matter. She\u0027d never fired one. Thorvaldsen seemed to sense her hesitation and offered her his gun. \"Want to switch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not refuse. \"You can handle one of those?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a little experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a mental note to inquire more about that later. She approached the doorway and carefully spied into the hall. No one in either direction. She led the way as they crept down the hall toward the second-floor foyer, where a staircase led down to the main entrance. Another of the Greek fire machines appeared behind them, darting from one room into another. Its sudden appearance drew her attention momentarily away from what lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall to her left ended, replaced by a thick stone balustrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement below caught her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho instantly reacted by leveling their rifles and firing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCASSIOPEIA HEARD THE RAT-TAT-TAT OF AUTOMATIC WEAPON fire from inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer first thought was Ely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just remember,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve only got five good rounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey leaped from the chopper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA AND VIKTOR EMERGED FROM THE FISSURE AND STUDIED the scene a hundred meters below. Malone and Vitt were rushing from the helicopter carrying two assault rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are those loaded?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Minister. Blanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which Malone clearly knows, so they\u0027re carrying them for show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunfire from inside the house caused her alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those turtles will explode if damaged,\" Viktor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed Lyndsey before that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hid loaded magazines for the pistols and clips for the rifles on board,\" Viktor said. \"Just in case we needed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe admired his preparedness. \"You\u0027ve done well. I might have to reward you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First we need to finish this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clasped his shoulder. \"That we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINETY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBULLETS RICOCHETED OFF THE THICK MARBLE RAILING. A WALL mirror shattered, then crashed to the floor. Stephanie sought cover past where the balustrade began, the others huddled behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore bullets obliterated plaster to her right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily the angle gave them an element of protection. To obtain a clearer shot, the soldiers would have to climb the stairway, which would also give her an opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen came close. \"Let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back and the Dane sent a salvo from the AK-74 down to the ground floor. The rounds produced the intended result. All shooting from below stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA robot reappeared behind them from another of the bedchambers. She paid it no mind until the whine from its electric motor steadily increased in volume. She turned her head and spotted the mechanism approaching the spot where Ely and Lyndsey stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that thing,\" she mouthed to Ely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stuck out his foot and halted the machine\u0027s advance. It sensed an impediment, hesitated, then sprayed Ely\u0027s pants with mist. She saw him wince from the odor, strong even from her vantage, six feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing turned and headed in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore shots rang out from below as the second floor was peppered with bullets. They needed to retreat and use the concealed passages, but before she could give the order, ahead, on the other side of the railing, one of the soldiers rounded a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen saw him, too, and before she could raise her gun, he chopped the man down with a burst from the AK-74.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE APPROACHED THE HOUSE WITH CAUTION. HE GRIPPED the pistol in one hand, the assault rifle slung over the other shoulder. They entered through a rear terrace into an opulent salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA familiar smell greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreek fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Cassiopeia register the scent, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore gunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom somewhere on the ground floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed toward the ruckus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIKTOR FOLLOWED ZOVASTINA AS THEY DREW CLOSER TO THE house. They\u0027d stayed concealed and watched as Malone and Vitt entered. Lots of rounds being discharged from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are nine militia inside,\" Zovastina said. \"I told them not to use their weapons. Six robots are trolling, set to go when I push this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe produced one of the remote controllers he\u0027d many times used to detonate the turtles. He thought another warning in order. \"A bullet into any one of those machines that disables it will trigger an explosion, regardless of that controller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that she did not require a reminder, but also she did not react with her usual arrogance. \"Then we\u0027ll just have to be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not us I\u0027m worried about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCASSIOPEIA WAS ANXIOUS. ELY WAS SOMEWHERE IN THIS HOUSE, probably trapped, with Greek fire everywhere. She\u0027d seen its destructive force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe layout was a problem. The ground floor wound around itself like a labyrinth. She heard voices. Straight ahead, beyond another parlor dotted with gilt-framed art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone led the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe admired his courage. For someone who complained all the time about not wanting to play the game, he was a damn good player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto another room oozing baroque charm, Malone crouched behind a high-backed chair and motioned for her to head left. Beyond a wide archway, ten meters away, she saw shadows dance across the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore voices, in a language she did not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a diversion,\" Malone whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood. He had bullets. She didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just don\u0027t shoot me,\" she mouthed back as she assumed a position adjacent to the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone shifted quickly behind another chair that offered a clear view. She drew a breath, counted to three, and told her pounding heart to stay calm. This was foolish, but she should have a second or two of advantage. She leveled the rifle, swung around and planted her feet in the archway. Finger on the trigger, she let loose a volley of blank rounds. Two soldiers stood on the other side of the foyer, their guns pointed toward the second-floor railing, but her shots produced the desired effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled faces stared back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped firing and dropped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came two new bangs, as Malone shot both men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE HEARD THE PISTOL ROUNDS. SOMETHING NEW. HENRIK was crouched beside her, his finger ready on the rifle trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more of the soldiers appeared on the second floor, beyond where their comrade lay dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen instantly shot them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beginning to form a new opinion of this Dane. She\u0027d known him to be conniving, with a disappearing conscience, but he was also cold-nerved, clearly prepared to do whatever needed to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers\u0027 bodies flew back as high-powered rounds ripped through flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the robot and heard the pings at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the machines had turned the corner, behind the two dying soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullets had pierced its casing. The motor stuttered and jerked, like a wounded animal. Its funnel retracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the whole thing erupted in flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINETY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE HEARD SHOTS FROM ABOVE, THEN A SWOOSH, FOLLOWED by an intense rush of unnatural heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized what had happened and fled from behind the chair, darting to the archway as Cassiopeia sprang to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlames poured from the second floor, engulfing the marble railing and consuming the walls. Glass in the tall outer windows shattered from the fiery assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floor ignited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE SHIELDED HERSELF FROM THE WAVES OF HEAT THAT rushed past. The robot did not actually explode, more vaporized in an atomiclike flash. She lowered her arm to see fire stretching in all directions, like a tsunami-walls, ceiling, even the floor succumbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty feet away and closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fled the approaching maelstrom, running fast, but the flames were gaining ground. She realized the danger. Ely had been sprayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen feet away and closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the bedchamber where they\u0027d first exited the hidden passage was open just ahead. Lyndsey found it first. Ely next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Thorvaldsen made it inside just as danger arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HE\u0027S UP THERE,\" CASSIOPEIA SAID TO THE SCENE OF THE SECOND floor burning, then she yelled, \"Ely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone wrapped his arm around her neck and clamped her mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not alone,\" he whispered in her ear. \"Think. More soldiers. And Zovastina and Viktor. They\u0027re here. You can count on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going after him,\" she made clear. \"Those guards had to be shooting at them. Who else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no way of knowing anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where are they?\" she asked the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned and they retreated into the parlor. He heard furniture crashing and more glass shattering from above. Luckily, none of the flames had descended the stairway, as in the Greco-Roman museum. But one of the priming mechanisms, as if sensing the heat, appeared across the foyer, which raised a concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one exploded, more could, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA HEARD SOMEONE CALL OUT ELY\u0027S NAME, BUT SHE\u0027D also felt the heat from the robot\u0027s disintegration and smelled burning Greek fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fools,\" she whispered to her troops, somewhere in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Vitt who shouted,\" Viktor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find our men. I\u0027ll find her and Malone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE SPOTTED THE CONCEALED DOOR, STILL OPEN, AND LED the way inside, quickly closing it behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God,\" Lyndsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo smoke had yet accumulated in the hidden passage, but she heard fire trying to find its way through the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey retreated to the stairway and scampered down to ground level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept an eye out for the first available exit and saw an open door just ahead. Thorvaldsen saw it, too, and they exited into the mansion\u0027s dining hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE COULD NOT ANSWER CASSIOPEIA\u0027S QUESTION ABOUT THE whereabouts of Stephanie, Henrik, and Ely, and he, too, was concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time you back off,\" Cassiopeia said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat surliness from Copenhagen had returned. He thought a dose of reality might help. \"We only have three bullets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed past him, retrieved the assault rifles from the two dead guards, and checked the clips. \"Plenty of rounds.\" She handed him one. \"Thanks, Cotton, for getting me here. But I have to do this.\" She paused. \"On my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that arguing with her was fruitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s certainly another way up there,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to resign himself to follow her when movement to his left set off an alarm and he whirled, gun ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor appeared in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone fired a burst from the AK-74 and instantly sought cover in the foyer. He could not see if he hit the man but, looking around, one thing he knew for certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE HEARD SHOTS FROM SOMEWHERE ON THE GROUND floor. The dining hall spread out before her in an elaborate rectangle with towering walls, a vaulted ceiling, and leaded glass windows. A long table with a dozen chairs down each side dominated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to leave,\" Thorvaldsen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyndsey bolted away, but Ely cut him off and slammed the scientist to the tabletop, jostling some of the chairs. \"I told you we were going to the lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go to hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty feet away, Cassiopeia appeared in the doorway. She was wet, looked tired, and carried a rifle. Stephanie watched as her friend spotted Ely. She\u0027d taken a huge chance going with Zovastina from Venice, but the gamble had now paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEly spotted her, too, and released his grip on Lyndsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Cassiopeia, Irina Zovastina materialized and nestled the barrel of a rifle against Cassiopeia\u0027s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEly froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Minister\u0027s clothes and hair were also wet. Stephanie debated challenging her, but the odds shifted when Viktor and three soldiers appeared and leveled their weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lower the guns,\" Zovastina said. \"Slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie locked her gaze on Cassiopeia and shook her head, signaling this was a battle they could not win. Thorvaldsen took the lead and laid his weapon on the table. She decided to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyndsey,\" Zovastina said. \"Time for you to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.\" He started to back away, toward Stephanie. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time for this,\" Zovastina said, and she motioned to one of the soldiers, who rushed toward Lyndsey, who was retreating back to where the concealed panel remained open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEly moved like he was going to grab the scientist, but when the soldier arrived, he shoved Lyndsey into him and slipped into the back passage, closing the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie heard guns raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Zovastina yelled. \"Let him go. I don\u0027t need him and this place is about to burn to the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE NAVIGATED THE MAZE OF ROOMS. ONE AFTER THE OTHER. Corridor to room to another corridor. He\u0027d seen no one, but continued to smell fire burning on the upper stories. Most of the smoke seemed to have risen to the third floor, but it wouldn\u0027t be long before the air here became tainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to find Cassiopeia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had she gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed a door that opened to what looked like an oversized storage closet. He glanced inside and noticed something unusual. Part of the unfinished paneled wall stood open, revealing a concealed passage. Beyond, bulbs tossed down stagnant pools of weak light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard footsteps from inside the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped the rifle and flattened himself against the stinking wall, just outside the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast steps kept coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe readied himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone emerged from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one hand he slammed the body into the wall, jamming the gun, his finger on the trigger, into the man\u0027s jaw.
