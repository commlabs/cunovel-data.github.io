{"id":16411,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII I AM ENTRUSTED WITH A DELICATE MISSION","content":"Although the fortunes of war turned out for the benefit of Japan in general, this was not the case with the troops among which I found myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When I had seen the general studying the map so intently I had concluded that he had good reason to be so serious. Frankly, I understood very little of what was going on, but Fiam knew all about it perfectly, and he didn’t always explain it to me, because he said it was dangerous to tell everything to foreigners by the Haji of the wire. But I felt from his looks that important events were taking place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was restless. He seemed to be cherishing a secret sorrow. During the fighting, while he watched from my hat, he was beside himself with excitement and ran around the brim crying:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no! The great thunder to the right, the little thunder to the center! Quick! Whatever are they doing! To the right, I said. Stop! It is a mistake.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [140]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he wouldn’t tell me of what error he was speaking. To me it seemed as if things might be going very well. The enemy was withdrawing into a mountainous region, and we followed them without hindrance. What more could be desired?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The mountains grew nearer and nearer. As we approached them we came to a deep valley, long and dark, which from a distance could be seen swarming with the enemy in the midst of clouds of dust raised by the cannon, by the baggage and the columns of marching soldiers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One evening, after Fiam had been shouting “Halt!” from every side of my hat, he said to me:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Listen. I will tell you an important secret. If we enter that valley we are lost.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [141]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Truly,” I observed doubtingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Immediately. This whole division of our army would be captured. You must run to the general and tell him to halt here and take the road toward the right.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How shall I do it? He wouldn’t listen to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Try it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shall I say that you sent me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, he wouldn’t believe it. Tell him that you have explored and are persuaded. Do try.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He begged and implored with so much persistence that at last I decided to please him. I put him in my hat, mounted my horse and started.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I found the general riding in the midst of his guard. I asked to speak to him alone on a very important affair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “General,” I said gravely, “if you enter that valley you are lost!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped his horse, looked at me in amazement, and broke into a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ha, ha, you are joking.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Indeed, I felt a little shaky. I should have liked to beg his pardon and withdraw in peace, but I knew [142] that Fiam was listening, and I had unlimited faith in him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am not joking,” I said. “I beg you to believe that you risk having this part of your army captured.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked at me attentively as I went on:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Send out your scouts, and you will be convinced of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he replied courteously: “I have sent. The road is clear. Don’t worry. I think you need to take care of yourself. At the first stop take a long rest. Good-bye, and thank you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He held out his hand to me, spurred his horse, and rode off.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1795/52197.html","bookId":1078,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:43:43 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:43:43 AM"}
