It fills me with dread so icy cold that I feel like my fingers are turning numb. The plague. It’s happening. It’s all come full circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll tell you when you get here,” June finally says. “Best not to talk about it over earpieces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI DESPISE MY FIRST CONVERSATION WITH DAY AFTER eight months of no communication. I hate it. When did I become so manipulative? Why must I always use his weaknesses against him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night at 2306 hours, Anden came to my apartment complex and knocked on my door. Alone. I don’t even think guards were stationed in the hallway for his protection. It was my first warning that whatever he needed to tell me had to be important—and secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to ask a favor of you,” he said as I let him in. Anden has almost perfected the art of being a young Elector (calm, cool, collected, a proud chin under stress, an even voice when angered), but this time I could see the deep worry in his eyes. Even my dog, Ollie, could tell that Anden was troubled, and tried reassuring him by pushing his wet nose against Anden’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged Ollie away before turning back to Anden. “What is it?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnden ran a hand through his dark curls. “I don’t mean to disturb you so late at night,” he said, leaning his head down toward mine in quiet concern. “But I’m afraid this is not a conversation that can wait.” He stood close enough so that if I wanted to, I could tilt my face up and accidentally brush my lips against his. My heartbeat quickened at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnden seemed to sense the tension in my pose, because he took an apologetic step away and gave me more room to breathe. I felt a strange mixture of relief and disappointment. “The peace treaty is over,” he whispered. “The Colonies are preparing to declare war against us once again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I whispered back. “Why? What’s happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Word from my generals is that a couple of weeks ago, a deadly virus started sweeping through the Colonies’ warfront like wildfire.” When he saw my eyes widen in understanding, he nodded. He looked so weary, burdened with the weight of an entire nation’s safety. “Apparently I was too late in withdrawing our biological weapons from the warfront.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEden. The experimental viruses that Anden’s father had used in attempts to cause a plague in the Colonies. For months, I’d tried to push that to the back of my mind—after all, Eden was safe now, under the care of Day and, last I heard, slowly adjusting to semblances of a normal life. For the last few months, the warfront had stood silent while Anden attempted to hash out a peace treaty with the Colonies. I’d thought that we would be lucky, that nothing would come out of that biological warfare. Wishful thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do the Senators know?” I asked after a while. “Or the other Princeps-Elects? Why are you telling me this? I’m hardly your closest advisor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnden sighed and squeezed the bridge of his nose. “Forgive me. I wish I didn’t have to involve you in this. The Colonies believe that we have the cure to this virus in our laboratories and are simply withholding it. They demand we share it, or else they put all of their strength behind a full-scale invasion of the Republic. And this time, it won’t be a return to our old war. The Colonies have secured an ally. They struck a trade deal with Africa—the Colonies get military help, and in return, Africa gets half our land.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of foreboding crept over me. Even without him saying it, I could tell where this was going. “We don’t have a cure, do we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. But we do know which former patients have the potential to help us find that cure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started shaking my head. When Anden reached out to touch my elbow, I jerked away. “Absolutely not,” I said. “You can’t ask this of me. I won’t do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnden looked pained. “I have called for a private banquet tomorrow night to gather all of our Senators. We have no choice if we want to put a stop to this and find a way to secure peace with the Colonies.” His tone grew firmer. “You know this as well as I do. I want him to attend this banquet and hear us out. We need his permission if we’re going to get to Eden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s serious, I realized in shock. “You’ll never get him to do it. You realize that, don’t you? The country’s support for you is still soft, and Day’s alliance with you is hesitant at best. What do you think he’ll say to this? What if you anger him enough for him to call the people to action, to tell them to rebel against you? Or worse—what if he asks them to support the Colonies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I’ve thought through all of this.” Anden rubbed his temples in exhaustion. “If there was a better option, I’d take it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you want me to make him agree to this,” I added. My irritation was too strong to bother hiding. “I won’t do it. Get the other Senators to convince Day, or try convincing him yourself. Or find a way to apologize to the Colonies’ Chancellor—ask him to negotiate new terms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are Day’s weakness, June. He’ll listen to you.” Anden winced even as he said this, as if he didn’t want to admit it. “I know how this makes me sound. I don’t want to be cruel—I don’t want Day to see us as the enemy. But I will do what it takes to protect the Republic’s people. Otherwise, the Colonies will attack, and if that happens, you know it’s likely the virus will spread here as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was worse than that, even though Anden didn’t say it aloud. If the Colonies attack us with Africa at their side, then our military might not be strong enough to hold them back. This time, they might win. He’ll listen to you. I closed my eyes and bowed my head. I didn’t want to admit it, but I knew that Anden was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I did as he requested. I called Day and asked him to return to the capital. Just the thought of seeing him again leaves my heart pounding, aching from his absence in my life over these past months. I haven’t seen or spoken to him for so long . . . and this is going to be how we reunite? What will he think of me now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will he think of the Republic when he finds out what they want with his little brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1201 HOURS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDENVER COUNTY COURT OF FEDERAL CRIME.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e72°F INDOORS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIX HOURS UNTIL I SEE DAY AT THE EVENING BALL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e289 DAYS AND 12 HOURS SINCE METIAS’S DEATH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas and Commander Jameson are on trial today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so tired of trials. In the past four months, a dozen former Senators have been tried and convicted of participating in the plan to assassinate Anden, the plan that Day and I had barely managed to stop. Those Senators have all been executed. Razor has already been executed. Sometimes I feel like someone new is convicted each week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut today’s trial is different. I know exactly who is being sentenced today, and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in a balcony overlooking the courtroom’s round stage, my hands restless in their white silk gloves, my body constantly shifting in my vest and black ruffled coat, my boots quietly tapping against the balcony pillars. My chair is made out of synthetic oak and cushioned with soft, scarlet velvet, but somehow I just can’t make myself comfortable. To keep myself calm and occupied, I’m carefully entwining four straightened paper clips in my lap to form a small ring. Two guards stand behind me. Three circular rows of the country’s twenty-six Senators surround the stage, uniform in their matching scarlet-and-black suits, their silver epaulettes reflecting the chamber’s light, their voices echoing along the arched ceilings. They sound largely indifferent, as if they’re meeting about trade routes instead of people’s fates. Many are new faces that have replaced the traitor Senators, who Anden has already cleaned out. I’m the one who sticks out with my black-and-gold outfit (even the seventy-six soldiers standing guard here are clad in scarlet; two for each Senator, two for me, two for each of the other Princeps-Elects, four for Anden, and fourteen at the chamber’s front and back entrances, which means the defendants—Thomas and Commander Jameson—are considered fairly high risk and could possibly make a sudden move).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m no Senator, clearly. I am a Princeps-Elect and need to be distinguished as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo others in the chamber wear the same black-and-gold uniform that I do. My eyes wander over to them now, where they sit on other balconies. After Anden tapped me to train for the Princeps position, Congress urged him to select several others. After all, you cannot have only one person preparing to become the leader of the Senate, especially when that person is a sixteen-year-old girl without a shred of political experience. So Anden agreed. He picked out two more Princeps-Elects, both of them already Senators. One is named Mariana Dupree. My gaze settles on her, her nose turned up and her eyes heavy with sternness. Thirty-seven years old, Senator for ten years. She hated me the instant she laid eyes on me. I look away from her and toward the balcony where the second Princeps-Elect sits. Serge Carmichael, a jumpy thirty-two-year-old Senator and great political mind, who wasted no time showing me that he doesn’t appreciate my youth and inexperience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge and Mariana. My two rivals for the Princeps title. I feel exhausted just thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a balcony several dozen yards away, sitting flanked by his guards, Anden seems calm, reviewing something with one of the soldiers. He’s wearing a handsome gray military coat with bright silver buttons, silver epaulettes, and silver sleeve insignias. He occasionally glances down toward the prisoners standing in the chamber’s circle. I watch him for a moment, admiring his appearance of calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas and Commander Jameson are going to receive their sentences for crimes against the nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas looks tidier than usual—if that’s possible. His hair is slicked back, and I can tell that he must’ve emptied an entire can of shoe polish onto each of his boots. He stands at attention in the center of the chamber and stares straight ahead with an intensity that would make any Republic commander proud. I wonder what’s going through his mind. Is he picturing that night in the hospital alley, when he murdered my brother? Is he thinking of the many conversations he had with Metias, the moments when he had taken down his guard? Or the fateful night when he had chosen to betray Metias instead of help him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Jameson, on the other hand, looks slightly disheveled. Her cold, emotionless eyes are fixed on me. She has been watching me unflinchingly for the past twelve minutes. I stare back for a moment, trying to see some hint of a soul in her eyes, but nothing exists there except for an icy hatred, an absolute lack of conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look away, take deep, slow breaths, and try to focus on something else. My thoughts return to Day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been 241 days since he visited my apartment and bid me good-bye. Sometimes I wish Day could hold me in his arms again and kiss me the way he did on that last night, so close that we could barely breathe, his lips soft against mine. But then I take back that wish. The thought is useless. It reminds me of loss, just like how sitting here and looking down on the people who killed my family reminds me of all the things I used to have; it reminds me too of my guilt, of all the things Day used to have that I took from him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/champion-legend-3/page-3.html","bookId":1696,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:14 AM"}
