Heavy, unmarked by pitting or rust, seamlessly bent almost to right angles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your engineers,’ Rautos Hivanar said, ‘could determine no purpose to these mechanisms.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg’s brows rose at the man’s use of the word ‘mechanism’. He hefted the object in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have attempted to assemble these,’ the merchant continued, ‘to no avail. There are no obvious attachment points, yet, somehow, they seem to me to be of a piece. Perhaps some essential item is still buried beneath the river, but we have found nothing for three days now, barring a wheelbarrow’s worth of stone chips and shards-and these were recovered in a level of sediment far below these artifacts, leading me to believe that they pre-date them by centuries, if not millennia.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ Bugg muttered. ‘Eres’al, a mated pair, preparing flint for tools, here on the bank of the vast marsh. He worked the cores, she did the more detailed knapping. They came here for three seasons, then she died in childbirth, and he wandered with a starving babe in his arms until it too died. He found no others of his kind, for they had been scattered after the conflagration of the great forests, the wildfires sweeping out over the plains. The air was thick with ash. He wandered, until he died, and so was the last of his line.’ He stared unseeing at the artifact, even as its weight seemed to burgeon, threatening to tug at his arms, to drag him down to his knees. ‘But Icarium said there would be no end, that the cut thread was but an illusion-in his voice, then, I could hear his father.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand closed on his shoulder and swung him round. Startled, he met Rautos Hivanar’s sharp, glittering eyes. Bugg frowned. ‘Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You-you are inclined to invent stories. Or, perhaps, you are a sage, gifted with unnatural sight. Is this what I am hearing, old man? Tell me, who was this Icarium? Was that the name of the Eres’al? The one who died?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am sorry, sir.’ He raised the object higher. ‘This artifact-you will find it is identical to the massive object at the inn, barring scale. I believe this is what your servant wanted you to realize-as he himself did when he first looked upon the edifice once we had brought down the walls enclosing it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you certain of all this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’ Bugg gestured at the array of items on the table. ‘A central piece is missing, as you suspected, sir. Alas, you will not find it, for it is not physical. The framework that will hold it together is one of energy, not matter. And,’ he added, still in a distracted tone, ‘it has yet to arrive.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the artifact back down and walked from the chamber, back up the corridor, through the dry-rack room, out onto the terrace. Unmindful of the two workers pausing to stare across at him as Rautos Hivanar appeared as if in pursuit-the merchant’s hands were spread, palms up, as if beseeching, although the huge man said not a word, his mouth working in silence, as though he had been struck mute. Bugg’s glance at the large man was momentary. He continued on, along the passage between estate wall and compound wall, to the side postern near the front gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself once more on the street, only remotely noticing the passers-by in the cooler shade of afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has yet to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, it comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Watch where you’re walking, old man!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leave off him-see how he weeps? It’s an old man’s right to grieve, so leave him be.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Must be blind, the clumsy fool…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here, long before this city was bom, there stood a temple, into which Icarium walked-as lost as any son, the child severed from the thread. But the Elder God within could give him nothing. Nothing beyond what he himself was preparing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould you have imagined, K’rul, how Icarium would, take what you did? Take it into himself as would any child seeking a guiding hand? Where are you, K’rul? Do you sense his return? Do you know what he seeks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Clumsy or not, it’s a question of manners and proper respect.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg’s threadbare tunic was grasped and he was dragged to one side, then flung up against a wall. He stared at a battered face beneath the rim of a helm. To one side, scowling, another guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you know who we are?’ the man holding him demanded, baring stained teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karos Invictad’s thugs, aye. His private police, the ones who kick in doors at the middle of night. The ones who take mothers from babes, fathers from sons. The ones who, in the righteous glory that comes with unchallenged power, then loot the homes of the arrested, not to mention raping the daughters-’\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-87.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
