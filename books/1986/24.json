Normally it was because she was at work and needed something from the supply room. She always smiled. It was friendly. That was it. Looking for her had become my only past time. I was beginning to wonder if I was becoming a stalker. The only thing that kept me sane was she wasn\u0027t with another guy. She was rarely with Cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lived with him but he wasn\u0027t there often, I\u0027d heard. He was making up for lost time apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around the restaurant nervously, looking for Low. I needed to get a seat in her section before she came walking out into the dinning room. Otherwise there was a good chance she\u0027d have the hostess seat me somewhere else. I followed the short brunette back to a booth she assured me was one of Will ow\u0027s tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low should be with you in just a moment,\" the girl\u0027s high pitched voice startled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Thanks,\" and quickly took a seat placing the small package I had brought in with me in the seat and out of view. I didn\u0027t want her to have a chance to refuse it. I intended to leave it on the table when I left. That way if she was determined to reject my gift she\u0027d have to come find me first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped around the corner looking down at the small pad in her hand. A pencil was stuck behind her ear and her hair was pulled up into a messy bun on the back of her head. I missed her so much. I watched as she lifted her head. Those large expressive green eyes that haunted my dreams locked on me and she stumbled. The urge to jump up and go touch her was unbearable. I forced myself to remain in my seat but my eyes ate her up as she composed herself and continued over to my booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marcus,\" she said smiling nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"hello Low,\" I replied. The sweet honey suckle scent that clung to her filled the small booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you, uh, waiting on someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and grinned, \"Nope. Just me.\" The relief on her face gave me hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, okay. In that case, what can I get you to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like some sweet tea please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ow reached for the pencil tucked behind her ear and quickly jotted it down. I\u0027d never seen her write down drink orders before. Could my presence have her that rattled that she needed to write down sweet tea? God I hoped so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll be right back,\" she flashed me a smile that didn\u0027t meet her eyes and quickly spun around and headed directly for the kitchen. She didn\u0027t stop at any of her other tables to check on them. Will ow needed a moment. Because of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in weeks I was able to take a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust maybe, I could reach her again. Those damn thick walls she\u0027d erected around her heart terrified me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do this. I can do this. I CAN do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay Low?\" Seth asked stopping beside me with a tray of drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, yeah, I\u0027m good. Just needed a breather,\" I forced yet another smile and reached for the sweet tea I\u0027d fixed for Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth nodded and headed back out the door into the dinning room. I needed to do the same. I ran my hand over my hair and smoothed my apron down then rolled my eyes at my ridiculous behavior. This was Marcus. He\u0027d shattered my heart. I did not care what he thought of me. My appearance was of no consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed back out into the dinning room and stopped at my other tables to check on them. I needed to get another bottle of tartar sauce, a glass of water, and some lemons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I still had Marcus\u0027s drink in my hands. I had to get this over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaning back in the booth watching me as I approached. I\u0027d felt his gaze on me while I\u0027d check on the other customers. It was a miracle I hadn\u0027t tripped and fell from my nervous reaction to his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here ya go,\" I placed the tea on the table in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready to order?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blackened grouper sounds good,\" he replied. I wanted to curl up in his lap. How ridiculous was that? Just hearing him talk had me needing to touch him and feel his arms around me again. Ugh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you not recommend that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped out of my internal obsessing and looked at him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus grinned at me and my insides went all crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re frowning. I was wondering if I\u0027d ordered the wrong thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face instantly warmed and I shook my head staring down at my order pad in an attempt to hide my blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no. That\u0027s really good. The grouper is nice and fresh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you suggest I try those sweet potato fries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they\u0027re different, um, maybe you should stick with the regular fries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus nodded and handed me the menu, \"Regular fries it is then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached to take his menu and fought the urge to look at him. I knew he was watching me. If I lifted my head our eyes would meet. I wasn\u0027t that strong yet. Maybe one day I would be. But I needed time. Slipping the menu under my arm, I hurried back to the kitchen. I needed another breather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter handing Marcus his check I\u0027d once again scurried back to the safety of the kitchen. I slumped against the back wall behind the industrial sized dishwasher and let out a frustrated groan. This had been torture. Marcus had been friendly and talkative. He\u0027d watched my every move as if I were the most fascinating thing he\u0027d ever seen. I was a ball of nerves. Twice girls, I didn\u0027t know who obviously knew him, had come up to him and done everything they could to coax him to go out dancing with them. He\u0027d brushed them off. Harshly. I\u0027d loved it. Each time I\u0027d lost the battle and glanced over at his booth, his eyes had been locked on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when he\u0027d had uninvited guest his gaze never seemed to waiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low, your friend left a tip and a box with your name written rather impressively for a guy on the table.\" Unable to mask my curiosity, I rushed back to the booth where Marcus had been seated. He\u0027d left a fifty dollar Bill to pay for his twenty dollar meal. Frowning, I pocketed the money and picked up the package he\u0027d left. I ran my finger over my name. I recognized his neat handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Seth. I\u0027ll be right back,\" I called out as I headed for the back door. I needed privacy. Once I was outside safely hidden out of the way, I opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a 2006 Guns \u0026amp; Roses Chinese Democracy t-shirt, signed by all the members of the band. A small note was tucked inside of it and I caught it just before it fell onto the muddy gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a story behind this shirt. I actually went to this concert opening night in Miami. It has been one of my prized possessions ever since. It\u0027s special because it was the only thing my dad ever took me to. He knew how bad I wanted to go. I\u0027d just turned fifteen and he came to my room one night with two tickets. They weren\u0027t just any tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were backstage passes. He\u0027d used every connection he could to get his hands on those tickets. It\u0027s the only fond memory I have of my dad. Maybe that\u0027s why it was so special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I want you to have it. I\u0027d like to see it on you instead of stuck back in a drawer in my dresser. It\u0027s one of the good parts of me and I\u0027d like to know it\u0027s in your hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you. I always will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-24.html","bookId":1986,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:58 AM"}
