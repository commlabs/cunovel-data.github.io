They’re located in a special display case known as ‘my scrotum.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRadar laughed, and Ben continued. “I mean, seriously. My balls are so big that when you order french fries from McDonald’s, you can choose one of four sizes: small, medium, large, and my balls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey cut her eyes at Ben and said, “Not. Appropriate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” Ben mumbled. “I think she’s in Orlando,” he said. “Watching us look. And watching her parents not look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m still for New York,” Lacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All still possible,” I said. A Margo for each of us—and each more mirror than window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minimall looked as it had a couple days before. Ben parked, and I took them through the push-open door to the office. Once everyone was inside, I said softly, “Don’t turn on the flashlight yet. Give your eyes a chance to adjust.” I felt fingernails dig at my forearm. I whispered, “It’s okay, Lace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoops,” she said. “Wrong arm.” She’d been searching, I realized, for Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, the room came into a hazy gray focus. I could see the desks lined up, still waiting for workers. I turned on my flashlight, and then everyone else turned theirs on as well. Ben and Lacey stayed together, walking toward the Troll Hole to explore the other rooms. Radar walked with me to Margo’s desk. He knelt down to look closely at the paper calendar frozen on June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was leaning in next to him when I heard fast footsteps coming toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People,” Ben whispered urgently. He ducked down behind Margo’s desk, pulling Lacey with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next room!” he said. “Wearing masks. Official-looking. Gotta go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRadar shone his flashlight in the direction of the Troll Hole but Ben knocked it down forcefully. “We. Have. To. Get. Out. Of. Here.” Lacey was looking up at me, big-eyed and probably a little bit pissed off that I’d falsely promised her safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I whispered. “Okay, everybody out, through the door. Very cool, very quick.” I had just started to walk when I heard a booming voice shout, “WHO GOES THERE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. “Um,” I said, “we’re just visiting.” What an outlandishly lame thing to say. Through the Troll Hole, a white light blinded me. It might have been God Himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are your intentions?” The voice had a slight faked Britishness to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Ben stand up next to me. It felt good not to be alone. “We’re here investigating a disappearance,” he said with great confidence. “We weren’t going to break anything.” The light snapped off, and I blinked away the blindness until I saw three figures, each wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and a mask with two circular filters. One of them pulled the mask up to his forehead and looked at us. I recognized the goatee and flat, wide mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gus?” asked Lacey. She stood up. The SunTrust security guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lacey Pemberton. Jesus. What are you doing here? With no mask? This place has a ton of asbestos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exploring,” he said. Somehow Ben was emboldened with enough confidence to walk up to the other guys and offer handshakes. They introduced themselves as Ace and the Carpenter. I would venture to guess that these were pseudonyms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled around some rolling desk chairs and sat in an approximate circle. “Did you guys break the particleboard?” Gus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I did,” Ben explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We taped that up because we didn’t want anyone else in. If people can see a way in from the road, you get a lot of people coming in who don’t know shit about exploring. Bums and crack addicts and everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped forward toward them and said, “So, you, uh, knew that Margo came here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Gus answered, Ace spoke through the mask. His voice was slightly modulated but easy to understand. “Man, Margo was here all the damned time. We only come here a few times a year; it’s got asbestos, and anyway, it’s not even that good. But we probably saw her, like, what, like more than half the time we came here in the last couple years. She was hot, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was?” asked Lacey pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She ran away, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you know about that?” Lacey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, Jesus. I saw Margo with him,” Gus said, nodding toward me, “a couple weeks ago. And then I heard that she ran away. It occurred to me a few days later she might be here, so we visited.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never got why she liked this place so much. There’s not much here,” said the Carpenter. “It’s not great exploring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean exploring?” Lacey asked Gus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Urban exploring. We enter abandoned buildings, explore them, photograph them. We take nothing; we leave nothing. We’re just observers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a hobby,” said Ace. “Gus used to let Margo tag along on exploring trips when we were still in school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She had a great eye, even though she was only, like, thirteen,” Gus said. “She could figure a way into anywhere. It was just occasional back then, but now we go out like three times a week. There’s places all over. There’s an abandoned mental hospital over in Clearwater. It’s amazing. You can see where they strapped down the crazies and gave them electroshock. And there’s an old jail out west of here. But she wasn’t really into it. She liked to break into the places, but then she just wanted to stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, God that was annoying,” added Ace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Carpenter said, “She wouldn’t even, like, take pictures. Or run around and find stuff. She just wanted to go inside and, like, sit. Remember, she had that black notebook? And she would just sit in the corner and write, like she was in her house, doing homework or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honestly,” Gus said, “she never really got what it’s all about. The adventure. She seemed pretty depressed, actually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to let them keep talking, because I figured everything they said would help me imagine Margo. But all of a sudden, Lacey stood up and kicked her chair behind her. “And you never thought to ask her about how she was pretty depressed actually? Or why she hung out in these sketch-ass places? That never bothered you?” She was standing above him now, shouting, and he stood up, too, half a foot taller than her, and then the Carpenter said, “Jesus, somebody calm that bitch down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no you didn’t!” Ben yelled, and before I even knew what was going on, Ben tackled the Carpenter, who fell awkwardly out of his chair onto his shoulder. Ben straddled the guy and started pounding on him, furiously and awkwardly smacking and punching his mask, shouting, “SHE’S NOT THE BITCH, YOU ARE!” I scrambled up and grabbed one of Ben’s arms as Radar grabbed the other. We pulled him away, but he was still shouting, “I have a lot of anger right now! I was enjoying punching the guy! I want to go back to punching him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ben,” I said, trying to sound calm, trying to sound like my mom. “Ben, it’s okay. You made your point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus and Ace picked up the Carpenter, and Gus said, “Jesus Christ, we’re getting out of here, okay? It’s all yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAce picked up their camera equipment, and they hustled out the back door. Lacey started to explain to me how she knew him, saying, “He was a senior when we were fr—.” But I waved it off. None of it mattered anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRadar knew what mattered. He returned immediately to the calendar, his eyes an inch away from the paper. “I don’t think anything was written on the May page,” he says. “The paper is pretty thin and I can’t see any marks. But it’s impossible to say for sure.” He went off to search for more clues, and I saw Lacey’s and Ben’s flashlights dipping as they went through a Troll Hole, but I just stood there in the office, imagining her. I thought of her following these guys, four years older than her, into abandoned buildings. That was Margo as I’d seen her. But then, inside the buildings, she is not the Margo I’d always imagined. While everyone else walks off to explore and take pictures and bounce around the walls, Margo sits on the floor, writing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom next door, Ben shouted, “Q! We got something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped sweat from my face with both sleeves and used Margo’s desk to pull myself up. I walked across the room, ducked through the Troll Hole, and headed toward the three flashlights scanning the wall above the rolled-up carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” Ben said, using the beam to draw a square on the wall. “You know those little holes you mentioned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They had to have been mementos tacked up there. Postcards or pictures, we think, from the spacing of the holes. Which maybe she took with her,” Ben said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, maybe,” I said. “I wish we could find that notebook Gus was talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, when he said that, I remembered that notebook,” Lacey said, the beam of my flashlight lighting up only her legs. “She had one with her all the time. I never saw her write in it, but I just figured it was like a day planner or whatever. God, I never asked about it. I get pissed at Gus, who wasn’t even her friend. But what did I ever ask her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wouldn’t have answered anyway,” I said. It was dishonest to act like Margo hadn’t participated in her own obfuscation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked around for another hour, and just when I felt sure the trip had been a waste, my flashlight happened over the subdivision brochures that had been built into a house of cards when we first came here. One of the brochures was for Grovepoint Acres. My breath caught as I spread out the other brochures. I jogged to my backpack by the door and came back with a pen and a notebook and wrote down the names of all the advertised subdivisions. I recognized one immediately: Collier Farms—one of the two pseudovisions on my list I hadn’t yet visited. I finished copying the subdivision names and returned my notebook to my backpack. Call me selfish, but if I found her, I wanted it to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Mom got home from work on Friday, I told her that I was going to a concert with Radar and then proceeded to drive out to rural Seminole County to see Collier Farms. All the other subdivisions from the brochures turned out to exist— most of them on the north side of town, which had been totally developed a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only recognized the turnoff for Collier Farms because I’d become something of an expert in hard-to-see dirt access roads. But Collier Farms was like none of the other pseudovisions I’d seen, because it was wildly overgrown, as if it had been abandoned for fifty years. I didn’t know if it was older than the other pseudovisions, or if the low-lying, swamp-wet land made everything grow faster, but the Collier Farms access road became impassable just after I turned in because a thick grove of brambly brush had sprouted across the entire road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out and walked. The overgrown grass scraped at my shins, and my sneakers sunk into the mud with each step. I couldn’t help but hope she had a tent pitched out here somewhere on some little piece of land two feet higher than everything else, keeping the rain off. I walked slowly, because there was more to see than at any of the others, more places to hide, and because I knew this pseudovision had a direct connection to the minimall. The ground was so thick I had to walk slowly as I let myself take in each new landscape, checking each place big enough to fit a person. At the end of the street I saw a blue-and-white cardboard box in the mud, and for a second it looked like the same nutrition bars I’d found in the minimall. But, no. A rotting container for a twelve-pack of beer. I trudged back to the minivan and headed for a place called Logan Pines farther to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took an hour to get there, and by now I was up near the Ocala National Forest, not really even the Orlando metro area anymore. I was a few miles away when Ben called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hittin’ those paper towns?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m almost to the last one I know of. Nothing yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So listen, bro, Radar’s parents had to leave town real suddenly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is everything okay?” I asked. I knew Radar’s grandparents were really old and lived in a nursing home down in Miami.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, get this: you know the guy in Pittsburgh with the world’s second-largest collection of black Santas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He just bit it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kidding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bro, I don’t kid about the demise of black Santa collectors. This guy had an aneurysm, and so Radar’s folks are flying to Pennsylvania to try to buy his entire collection. So we’re having a few people over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and me and Radar. We’re the hosts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, and then Ben used my full name. “Quentin,” he said, “I know you want to find her. I know she is the most important thing to you. And that’s cool. But we graduate in, like, a week. I’m not asking you to abandon the search. I’m asking you to come to a party with your two best friends who you have known for half your life. I’m asking you to spend two to three hours drinking sugary wine coolers like the pretty little girl you are, and then another two to three hours vomiting the aforementioned wine coolers through your nose. And then you can go back to poking around abandoned housing projects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt bothered me that Ben only wanted to talk about Margo when it involved an adventure that appealed to him, that he thought there was something wrong with me for focusing on her over my friends, even though she was missing and they weren’t. But Ben was Ben, like Radar said. And I had nothing left to search after Logan Pines anyway. “I’ve got to go to this last place and then I’ll be over.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/paper-towns/page-22.html","bookId":2377,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:05 AM"}
