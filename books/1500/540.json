The off-road vehicle suddenly roared, breaking free from the fleet, driving crazily into the distance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNo one appeared. In the rising earth, a thin gray shadow was currently jumping about at an inconceivable speed as it chased after the off-road vehicle. It was extremely fast, and within just a few minutes, it already caught up the the back of the off-road vehicles. It then sprung up, unexpectedly using the crushed rock that flew out from behind the tires as landing points. With a few more jumps, it immediately reached the roof of the off-road vehicle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was a strange creature. There was a layer of fine scales on its back, the surface glossy, reflecting the surrounding environment’s color, making it hard to see clearly. Its head was slightly pointed, its belly and back a bit larger than the rest of its body, its appearance similar to a pangolin. The area close to its back had two strong and forceful short limbs, and close to its head was a pair of short hook claws. Each time it jumped out, it would always curl up its body, using the four rear legs to grab the ground or rocks. Then, its body would erupt with inconceivable power, shooting out like an arrow towards its target. Its calculation ability was shocking, its landing point each time extremely precise. Meanwhile, while moving through the air, its six slender limbs would always press closely against its body, making it look like a bullet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith its body that was only ten centimeters, it could unexpectedly catch up to a fast moving off-road vehicle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe off-road vehicle had already reached its greatest speed, the vehicle body fiercely shaking, about to fall over at any time. The driver, soldiers, and machine gun shooter were all shaken until their faces were white, but Tegan was still frantically demanding for the driver to drive faster, even a bit more so. The soldiers couldn’t see the enemy at all, nor did they know where the danger originated from. On this off-road vehicle that was like a wild horse, all they could do was grab on tightly, doing their best to stop themselves from being flung out. Under this type of speed, once they were flung out, broken bones was the best result.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTegan became more and more terrified, the great pressure making him a bit hysterical. His delicate and pretty face completely distorted. He sensed that an enormous danger had already arrived by his side, and was already sticking to him! This type of intuition was an instinctive warning from his body, a bit similar to the cry a frog made when a poisonous snake drew near. However, Tegan couldn’t see it at all, nor could he feel where the danger was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSuddenly, he felt a slight pain from the nape of his neck!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe off-road vehicle suddenly sprung out, losing balance in midair, the soldiers and marksman all flung outwards. Then, the off road vehicle planted itself into the ground, tumbling a few times before stopping. Blood continuously gushed out from the completely deformed driving cabin. The driver twitched a few times, and then no longer moved again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTegan was similarly flung out. His body bounced a few times on the ground, only stopping after he flew several dozen meters out. His own body that was equipped with three levels of defense ability was clearly sturdier than that of the ordinary soldiers, so it would only result in heavy injuries at most. Sure enough, after a few minutes, Tegan’s body finally moved, and then he slowly climbed up, continuously moving his body and limbs. However, his movements seemed rigid and strange, not like that of a human’s but more like a living corpse’s.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTegan slowly turned around, giving the burning off-road vehicle a glance. His eyes already strangely became a dark green. When he saw that the three soldiers that were flung out had already died, only then did he release a laugh. However, his smile was a bit unnatural, and the flesh on his face seemed completely disjointed. Tegan’s face suddenly wrigged about, his appearance starting to slowly transform. In addition, sounds of varying volume rang out from within his body, as if there was water boiling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the blink of an eye, Tegan’s face already became the face of an extremely strange looking infant!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf one only looked at his face, then one would feel that this was an extremely pretty face that carried a charming smile.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis face, was Luo.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-5-chapter-2-6\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-5-chapter-3-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-5-chapter-2-7","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM"}
