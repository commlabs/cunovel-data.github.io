I\u0027d been warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time the end was a greater surprise than it had ever been. Greater than any end I\u0027d remembered in nine lives. Greater than jumping down an elevator shaft. I had expected no more memories, no more thoughts. What end was this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun is setting-the colors are all rosy, and they make me think of my friend... what would her name be here? Something about... ruffles? Ruffles and more ruffles. She was a beautiful Flower. The flowers here are so lifeless and boring. They smell wonderful, though. Smells are the best part of this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps behind me. Has Cloud Spinner followed me again? I don\u0027t need a jacket. It\u0027s warm here-finally!-and I want to feel the air on my skin. I won\u0027t look at her. Maybe she\u0027ll think I can\u0027t hear and she\u0027ll go home. She is so careful with me, but I\u0027m almost grown now. She can\u0027t mother me forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" someone says, and I don\u0027t know the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to look at her, and I don\u0027t know the face, either. She\u0027s pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face in the memory jerked me back to myself. That was my face! But I didn\u0027t remember this...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello. My name is Melanie.\" She smiles at me. \"I\u0027m new in town and... I think I\u0027m lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! Where are you trying to go? I\u0027ll take you. Our car is just back -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not far. I was going for a walk, but now I can\u0027t find my way back to Becker Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s a new neighbor-how nice. I love new friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very close,\" I tell her. \"It\u0027s just around the second corner up that way, but you can cut right through this little alley here. It takes you straight there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you show me? I\u0027m sorry, what\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! Come with me. I\u0027m Petals Open to the Moon, but my family mostly calls me Pet. Where are you from, Melanie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. \"Do you mean San Diego or the Singing World, Pet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either one.\" I laugh, too. I like her smile. \"There are two Bats on this street. They live in that yellow house with the pine trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to say hello,\" she murmurs, but her voice has changed, tensed. She\u0027s looking into the dusky alley as though she\u0027s expecting to see something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there is something there. Two people, a man and a boy. The boy drags his hand through his long black hair like he\u0027s nervous. Maybe he is worried because he\u0027s lost, too. His pretty eyes are wide and excited. The man is very still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie. Jared. My heart thumped, but the feeling was peculiar, wrong. Too small and... fluttery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are my friends, Pet,\" Melanie tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! Oh, hello.\" I stretch my hand out to the man-he\u0027s the closest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches for my hand, and his grip is so strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yanks me forward, right up to his body. I don\u0027t understand. This feels wrong. I don\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart beats faster, and I\u0027m afraid. I\u0027ve never been scared like this before. I don\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand swings toward my face, and I gasp. I suck in the mist that comes from his hand. A silver cloud that tastes like raspberries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wha -\" I want to ask, but I can\u0027t see them anymore. I can\u0027t see anything...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda? Can you hear me, Wanda?\" a familiar voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t the right name... was it? My ears didn\u0027t react to it, but something did. Wasn\u0027t I Petals Open to the Moon? Pet? Was that it? That didn\u0027t feel right, either. My heart beat faster, an echo of the fear in my memory. A vision of a woman with white-and-red-streaked hair and kind green eyes filled my head. Where was my mother? But... she wasn\u0027t my mother, was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound, a low voice that echoed around me. \"Wanda. Come back. We aren\u0027t letting you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was familiar, and it was also not. It sounded like... me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Petals Open to the Moon? I couldn\u0027t find her. Just a thousand empty memories. A house full of pictures but no inhabitants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use the Awake,\" a voice said. I didn\u0027t recognize this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething brushed my face, light as the touch of fog. I knew that scent. It was the smell of grapefruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deeper breath, and my mind suddenly cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel that I was lying down... but this felt wrong, too. There wasn\u0027t... enough of me. I felt shrunken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were warmer than the rest of me, and that was because they were being held. Held in big hands, hands that swallowed them right up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt smelled odd-stuffy and a little moldy. I remembered the smell... but surely I\u0027d never smelled it before in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw nothing but dull red-the insides of my eyelids. I wanted to open them, so I went searching for the right muscles to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanderer? We\u0027re all waiting for you, honey. Open your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis voice, this warm breath against my ear, was even more familiar. A strange feeling tickled through my veins at the sound. A feeling I\u0027d never, ever felt before. The sound made my breath catch and my fingers tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to see the face that went with that voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA color washed through my mind-a color that called to me from a faraway life-a brilliant, glowing blue. The whole universe was bright blue...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally I knew my name. Yes, that was right. Wanderer. I was Wanderer. Wanda, too. I remembered that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light touch on my face-a warm pressure on my lips, on my eyelids. Ah, that\u0027s where they were. I could make them blink now that I\u0027d found them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s waking up!\" someone crowed excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie. Jamie was here. My heart gave another fluttery little thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for my eyes to focus. The blue that stabbed my eyes was all wrong-too pale, too washed out. It wasn\u0027t the blue I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand touched my face. \"Wanderer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked to the sound. The movement of my head on my neck felt so odd. It didn\u0027t feel like it used to, but at the same time it felt the way it had always felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy searching eyes found the blue I\u0027d been looking for. Sapphire, snow, and midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian? Ian, where am I?\" The sound of the voice coming out of my throat frightened me. So high and trilling. Familiar, but not mine. \"Who am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re you,\" Ian told me. \"And you\u0027re right where you belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled one of my hands free from the giant\u0027s hand that held it. I meant to touch my face, but someone\u0027s hand reached toward me, and I froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reaching hand also froze above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to move my hand again, to protect myself, but that moved the hand above me. I started shaking, and the hand trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened and closed the hand, looking at it carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this my hand, this tiny thing? It was a child\u0027s hand, except for the long pink-and-white nails, filed into perfect, smooth curves. The skin was fair, with a strange silvery cast to it and, entirely incongruous, a scattering of golden freckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the odd combination of silver and gold that brought the image back: I could see a face in my head, reflected in a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting of the memory threw me off for a moment because I wasn\u0027t used to so much civilization-at the same time, I knew nothing but civilization. A pretty dresser with all kinds of frilly and delicate things on top of it. A profusion of dainty glass bottles containing the scents I loved-I loved? Or she loved?-so much. A potted orchid. A set of silver combs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big round mirror was framed in a wreath of metal roses. The face in the mirror was roundish, too, not quite oval. Small. The skin on the face had the same silver undertone-silver like moonlight-as the hand did, with another handful of the golden freckles across the bridge of the nose. Wide gray eyes, the silver of the soul shimmering faintly behind the soft color, framed by tangled golden lashes. Pale pink lips, full and almost round, like a baby\u0027s. Small, even white teeth behind them. A dimple in the chin. And everywhere, everywhere, golden, waving hair that stood away from my face in a bright halo and fell below where the mirror showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face or her face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the perfect face for a Night Flower. Like an exact translation from Flower to human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" my high, reedy voice demanded. \"Where is Pet?\" Her absence frightened me. I\u0027d never seen a more defenseless creature than this half-child with her moonlight face and sunlight hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s right here,\" Doc assured me. \"Tanked and ready to go. We thought you could tell us the best place to send her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked toward his voice. When I saw him standing in the sunlight, a lit cryotank in his hands, a rush of memories from my former life came back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc!\" I gasped in the tiny, fragile voice. \"Doc, you promised! You gave me your oath, Eustace! Why? Why did you break your word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dim recollection of misery and pain touched me. This body had never felt such agony before. It shied away from the sting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even an honest man sometimes caves to duress, Wanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duress,\" another terribly familiar voice scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say a knife to the throat counts as duress, Jared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew I wouldn\u0027t really use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I did not. You were quite persuasive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A knife?\" My body trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh, it\u0027s all okay,\" Ian murmured. His breath blew strands of golden hair across my face, and I brushed them away-a routine gesture. \"Did you really think you could leave us that way? Wanda!\" He sighed, but the sigh was joyful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan was happy. This insight made my worry suddenly much lighter, easier to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I didn\u0027t want to be a parasite,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me through,\" my old voice ordered. And then I could see my face, the strong one, with the sun-brown skin, the straight black line of the eyebrows over the almond-shaped, hazel eyes, the high, sharp cheekbones... See it backward, not as a reflection, the way I\u0027d always seen it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen up, Wanda. I know exactly what you don\u0027t want to be. But we\u0027re human, and we\u0027re selfish, and we don\u0027t always do the right thing. We aren\u0027t going to let you go. Deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way she spoke, the cadence and the tone, not the voice, brought back all the silent conversations, the voice in my head, my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mel? Mel, you\u0027re okay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled then and leaned over to hug my shoulders. She was bigger than I remembered being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am. Wasn\u0027t that the point of all the drama? And you\u0027re going to be fine, too. We weren\u0027t stupid about it. We didn\u0027t just grab the first body we saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me tell her, let me!\" Jamie shoved in beside Mel. It was getting very crowded around the cot. It rocked, unstable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his hand and squeezed it. My hands felt so feeble. Could he even feel the pressure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Wanda! This is cool, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re smaller than me now!\" He grinned, triumphant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still older. I\u0027m almost -\" And then I stopped, changing my sentence abruptly. \"My birthday is in two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might have been disoriented and confused, but I wasn\u0027t stupid. Melanie\u0027s experiences had not gone to waste; I had learned from them. Ian was every bit as honorable as Jared, and I was not going to go through the frustration Melanie had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I lied, giving myself an extra year. \"I\u0027ll be eighteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Melanie and Ian stiffen in surprise. This body looked much younger than her true age, hovering on the edge of seventeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this little deception, this preemptive claiming of my partner, that made me realize I was staying here. That I would be with Ian and the rest of my family. My throat thickened, felt oddly swollen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie patted my face, calling my attention back. I was surprised at how big his hand felt on my cheek. \"They let me come on the raid to get you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I muttered. \"I remember... Well, Pet remembers seeing you there.\" I glared at Mel, who shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We tried not to scare her,\" Jamie said. \"She\u0027s so... kind of fragile-looking, you know? And nice, too. We picked her out together, but I got to decide! See, Mel said we had to get someone young-someone who had a bigger percentage of life as a soul or something. But not too young, because she knew you wouldn\u0027t want to be a child. And then Jared liked this face, because he said no one could ever dis... distrust it. You don\u0027t look dangerous at all. You look the opposite of dangerous. Jared said anyone who sees you would just naturally want to protect you, right, Jared? But then I got the final say, because I was looking for someone who looked like you. And I thought this looked like you. Because she sort of looks like an angel, and you\u0027re good like that. And real pretty. I knew you would be pretty.\" Jamie smiled hugely. \"Ian didn\u0027t come. He just sat here with you-he said he didn\u0027t care what you looked like. He wouldn\u0027t let anyone else put a finger on your tank at all, not even me or Mel. But Doc let me watch this time. It was way cool, Wanda. I don\u0027t know why you wouldn\u0027t let me watch before. They wouldn\u0027t let me help, though. Ian wouldn\u0027t let anyone touch you but him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan squeezed my hand and leaned in to whisper through all the hair. His voice was so low that I was the only one who could hear. \"I held you in my hand, Wanderer. And you were so beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes got all wet, and I had to sniff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like it, don\u0027t you?\" Jamie asked, his voice worried now. \"You\u0027re not mad? There\u0027s nobody in there with you, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not mad, exactly,\" I whispered. \"And I-I can\u0027t find anybody else. Just Pet\u0027s memories. Pet\u0027s been in here since... I can\u0027t remember when she wasn\u0027t here. I can\u0027t remember any other name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a parasite,\" Melanie said firmly, touching my hair, pulling up a strand and letting the gold slide between her fingers. \"This body didn\u0027t belong to Pet, but there\u0027s nobody else to claim it. We waited to make sure, Wanda. We tried to wake her up almost as long as we tried with Jodi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jodi? What happened to Jodi?\" I chirped, my little voice going higher, like a bird\u0027s, with anxiety. I struggled to get up, and Ian pulled me-it took no effort, no strength to move my tiny new body-into a sitting position with his arm supporting me. I could see all the faces then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc, no more tears in his eyes. Jeb, peeking around Doc, his expression satisfied and burning with curiosity at the same time. Next, a woman I didn\u0027t recognize for a second because her face was more animated than I\u0027d ever seen it, and I hadn\u0027t seen it much anyway-Mandy, the former Healer. Closer to me, Jamie, with his bright, excited smile, Melanie beside him, and Jared behind her, his hands around her waist. I knew that his hands would never feel right unless they were touching her body-my body!-now. That he would keep her as close as he could forever, hating any inch that came between them. This caused me a fierce, aching pain. The delicate heart in my thin chest shuddered. It had never been broken before, and it didn\u0027t understand this memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me sorry to realize that I still loved Jared. I wasn\u0027t free of that, wasn\u0027t free of jealousy for the body he loved. My glance flickered back to Mel. I saw the rueful twist of the mouth that used to be mine, and knew she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued quickly around the cluster of faces circling my bed, while Doc, after a pause, answered my question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrudy and Geoffrey, Heath, Paige and Andy. Brandt, even...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jodi didn\u0027t respond. We kept trying as long as we could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Jodi gone, then? I wondered, my inexperienced heart throbbing. I was giving the poor frail thing such a rough awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi and Lily, Lily smiling a pained little smile-none the less sincere for the pain...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were able to keep her hydrated, but we had no way to feed her. We were worried about atrophy-her muscles, her brain...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile my new heart ached harder than it had ever ached-ached for a woman I\u0027d never known-my eyes continued around the circle and then froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodi, clinging to Kyle\u0027s side, stared back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled tentatively, and suddenly I recognized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sunny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to stay,\" she said, not quite smug but almost. \"Just like you.\" She glanced at Kyle\u0027s face-which was more stoic than I was used to seeing it-and her voice turned sad. \"I\u0027m trying, though. I am looking for her. I will keep looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyle had us put Sunny back when it looked like we would lose Jodi,\" Doc continued quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Sunny and Kyle for a moment, stunned, and then finished the circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan was watching me with a strange combination of joy and nervousness. His face was higher than it should have been, bigger than it used to be. But his eyes were still the blue I remembered. The anchor that held me to this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay in there?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. \"This feels very... weird. Every bit as weird as switching species. So much weirder than I would have thought. I... I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart fluttered again, looking into those eyes, and this was no memory of another lifetime\u0027s love. My mouth felt dry, and my stomach quivered. The place where his arm touched my back felt more alive than the rest of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mind staying here too much, do you, Wanda? Do you think that maybe you could tolerate it?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie squeezed my hand. Melanie put hers on top of his, then smiled when Jared added his to the pile. Trudy patted my foot. Geoffrey, Heath, Heidi, Andy, Paige, Brandt, and even Lily were beaming at me. Kyle had shuffled closer, a grin spreading across his face. Sunny\u0027s smile was the smile of a coconspirator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much No Pain had Doc given me? Everything was glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan brushed the cloud of golden hair back from my face and laid his hand on my cheek. His hand was so big just the palm covered from my jaw to my forehead; the contact sent a jolt of electricity through my silvery skin. It tingled after that first jolt, and the pit of my stomach tingled along with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel a warm flush pinking my cheeks. My heart had never been broken before, but it had also never flown. It made me shy; I had a hard time finding my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I could do that,\" I whispered. \"If it makes you happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not good enough, actually,\" Ian disagreed. \"It has to make you happy, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only meet his gaze for a few seconds at a time; the shyness, so new and confusing to me, had my eyes dropping to my lap again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... think it might,\" I agreed. \"I think it might make me very, very happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappy and sad, elated and miserable, secure and afraid, loved and denied, patient and angry, peaceful and wild, complete and empty... all of it. I would feel everything. It would all be mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan coaxed my face up until I looked him in the eyes, my cheeks flushing darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me, right in front of everyone, but I forgot the audience quickly. This was easy and right, no division, no confusion, no objection, just Ian and me, the molten rock moving through this new body, melding it into the pact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will stay,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my tenth life began. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-60.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
