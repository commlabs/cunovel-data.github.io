The crowds in the streets were slightly rowdy, but Bryan knew Jessica was always happiest when her city was doing well, so he ignored the noise from outside. For the first time in perhaps forever, he was completely relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what if a werewolf was buying the beers? And half of his new best friends were mostly vampires? At least a few were actually human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica was watching the band with a smile. Big Jim smiled back, and so did Barry Larson, who seemed to exude a newfound confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo lives had been lost in Scotland. He considered that something of a miracle, but those fighting with him just called it a good night\u0027s work. The authorities had found a bunch of crazed kids running around and chalked it up to drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome would remember the truth. Some would learn from it. Some would spend the rest of their lives in therapy. But at least they had lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Mary, that had been tricky, but he had to admit that she had developed a real passion for good, so a story had been invented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed up at the police station one day, claiming amnesia. Only seeing her own picture on television had reminded her of who she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean, sitting between Jessica and Maggie, looked thoughtful, unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Maggie asked him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost two really good cops,\" he said sadly. \"Nothing can ever change that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica\u0027s brow furrowed. \"It was not your fault. Don\u0027t even start that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the werewolf appeared with the beers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jessica, are you going to design your own wedding dress?\" Maggie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica choked on her beer. \"Maggie, no one\u0027s asked me to marry him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stared at Bryan. He felt a smile curving his lips, and he stared at Jessica. \"What do you think?\" he asked softly. \"Can a warrior and a vampire find happiness in this day and age?\" he inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at him, her eyes grave. \"I don\u0027t know. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose, taking her hand. \"I don\u0027t know. But we can all learn new things, right?\" He pulled her up and into his arms. \"I do know that I will love you for eternity,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the jazz played on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, after all, New Orleans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurn the page for an exciting excerpt from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE DEAD ROOM,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe next paranormal novel by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York Timesbestselling author\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather Graham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable in March 2007,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly from MIRA Books\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been an explosion, she thought. Someone had screamed something about gas, and then a blast had seemed to rock the world. Yes, she could remember now, the feeling of being lifted, of flying...slamming hard against the wall. But...she wasn\u0027t leaning against the wall now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking down on a scene of absolute chaos.And she was in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see herself, who had been taken and placed in a line of sleeping people. She didn\u0027t recognize any of them. Matt...where was Matt? Others were hurrying around the room, moving with purpose. They were all in uniform, firemen and cops. The freshly painted walls of the room were blackened and scorched almost to the doorway, evidence of the blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurt! Oh, God, she ached in every bone. The scent of charred wood-worse, charred flesh-filled her nostrils. She remembered the terrible sound, the way she had been lifted and thrown as the room was rocked by the explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she looked down on herself, contemplated the others near and realized that the people she was lying with weren\u0027t sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see the open, glazed eyes of the woman beside her.
