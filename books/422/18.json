\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A marvel it is past telling, oft have we known it betide:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the slayer murder-polluted is seen by the dead man’s side,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The wounds bleed in witness against him: so did it now befall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thereby was the guilt of Hagen made manifest unto all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the wound brake forth into bleeding, as freely as at the first.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now they that before wept sorely into wilder weeping burst.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But answered and spake King Gunther: “Now hearken, the truth is this—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was set on and slain of robbers: no deed of Hagen it is.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Kriemhild replied: “These robbers but all too well I know!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n God give to the hands of his kinsmen vengeance

with all the true souls there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, from the heart they lamented for Kriemhild’s perished lord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now pealed the holy mass-chant: through the doors of the minster poured\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On every hand young children no less than women and men.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even they whom

shone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Loving hands from the bier uplifted the corpse that lay thereon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the Queen said: “Nay, I beseech you, lay him not

throngs of them\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With their offerings—ah, how freely!—to buy his soul’s repose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Good friends had he without number in the very house of his foes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kriemhild the hapless woman to her treasure-keeper spake:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now sorrow ye all in my sorrow, and

for the masses for him who lay stark under pall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, full one hundred masses on that one day did they sing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, there was a mighty concourse of lovers of that dead king!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When ended was all the mass-chant, the vast crowd melted away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But again to her friends spake Kriemhild: “Leave me not this day\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To keep vigil alone o’er the hero, the hope of the world and its pride;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now all the joy of my life-days is buried by his side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Three days, three nights unceasing will I keep vigil here\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till my soul is filled with lamenting for him, my lord most dear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peradventure His white Death-angel for me too God will send;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the sorrow of Kriemhild the hapless should find a blessèd end.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now homeward the folk of the city were gone to their rest and their sleep:\n\u003c/div\u003e

chief—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, weariful nights were appointed to these, and days of grief.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through the days of their mourning many drank not, nor tasted of bread:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But, for such as could not endure it, to these was it plainly said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Eat, drink, for we give to you freely.” King Siegmund cared therefor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then fell on the faithful Niblungs trouble and travail sore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As telleth the olden
