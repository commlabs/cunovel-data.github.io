There\u0027s a saying in this part of the world: Alaskan royals wrestle bears, but only after tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis hardiness was vital for a young vast country. Alaskans had to be tough, not only to break from Mother Russia in 1863, but to then go on and form their own government. It could not have been easy, but the royal family rose to the occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s precisely this hardiness that occasionally causes trouble. Queen Christina\u0027s father-in-law, King Alexander II, was no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorical records confirm King Alexander adored his daughter-in-law from the moment he set eyes on her. With characteristic impulsiveness, he decided this tough, uncompromising commoner would be perfect for his son, the Crown Prince David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, convincing His Highness the Prince, not to mention the woman who would eventually become the mother of kings, was no simple matter. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePART ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody really knows me, and I don\u0027t really know anybody. But that\u0027s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Christina Krabbe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you ever touch me again, I\u0027ll pull off your ears and stuff them up your nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina Krabbe explained this fact of life to her supervisor, who was at the moment rolling around on the deck, cradling his mashed privates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever should have gotten out of bed. Should have tossed the clock on the floor and gone back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027d never been late for work a day in her life, and if she didn\u0027t crack eight hundred eggs for Friday\u0027s rosemary scrambled eggs, who would?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina had known there would be trouble, almost from the moment she came on board. Ed had \"accidentally\" brushed her butt or a breast a million times. Never enough to be called on his behavior, always enough to make her dread the next time she ran into him. She was just surprised her boss had taken this long—almost three weeks—to make his move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut today... coming up behind her and grabbing her boobs like she was a cow to be milked . .. she\u0027d back-kicked and elbow-struck, and then he was on the floor and it was done and couldn\u0027t be taken back. Not that she would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips were moving. She bent closer to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\".. . fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... fired. You\u0027re fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. What\u0027s the phrase? You can\u0027t fire me, I quit? Is that it? I ought to sue your ass, Ed, you lecherous piece of shit. But frankly, you\u0027re not worth the time, the trouble, or the aggravation.\" Also, I have no money for a lawyer. But never mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her belongings into a duffel bag while he recovered, climbed painfully to his feet, and shuffled out the door. She didn\u0027t watch him go. She\u0027d worry about a reference later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched down the gangplank, flashed her employee badge to the guy counting noses, then promptly dropped it into the garbage can at the end of the dock and fell in line behind the geese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least they were in port. If Ed had tried his crap while they were at sea, she\u0027d have had a long swim ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the tour guides—the line employed several dozen, and she could never keep them straight— was doing Alaska 101 for the geese. Christina eased her way past the throng, half-listening to the spiel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—Russia did actually offer Alaska to the United States for sale. As you know, America had the Civil War to contend with, and thus wasn\u0027t interested in the purchase at that time, but can you imagine if they had? Alaska would have been the forty-ninth state!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd since gold and oil were discovered here, we\u0027ve been kicking ourselves about that ever since, Christina thought, smothering a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tour guide droned on while Chris put the gangplank, the ship, Ed, and French Toast Tuesday behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Summer\u0027s Sweetness—an exquisitely stupid name for a cruise ship—was leaving port tonight. She had no plans to be on it. She wasn\u0027t going near Ed again—he might get the idea in his head that a little payback would be balm to his battered ego. Some men were weird that way. Knock them around defending yourself, and they decide the only way to fix it is to hurt you back twice as bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the ship sailed, she\u0027d still be in port. Marooned in Juneau, Alaska, over a thousand miles from her birthplace. Marooned at the edge of the world, in a place with a famously nutty royal family and more bears than cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom The Queen of the Edge of the World by Edmund Dante III, © 2089, Harper Zebra and Schuster Publications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Alexander II, head of the House of Baranov, was, as was most of the royal family, a conundrum. Raised to wealth and privilege, he had a common streak. However, he was rarely allowed to \"get down and dirty,\" as His Majesty might have put it, due to his responsibilities, the hovering of his major-domo, Edmund Dante, and his bodyguards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften His Majesty would let his beard grow and take a group out fishing. This drove people mad, in particular: (A) his security team, (B) Edmund Dante, and (C) the people in his fishing group. King Alexander was always surprised to be recognized, and once he was, quite a lot of the fun went out of the group. It was difficult for Alaskans to enjoy a day of leisure when they realized their sovereign was the one driving the boat and gutting the fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re catching tons of fish, but you haven\u0027t cracked a smile all afternoon.\" The captain of the boat plunked down beside her, stretched out his long legs, and stared at the toes of his rubber boots. \"What\u0027s the matter, kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" She looked at the other members of the fishing party, who were all huddled on the other end of the boat, staring at them. Weird. It had been a pretty jolly group earlier, and now they were walking around like there was glass in their boots. \"I\u0027ll tell you my problem, if you tell me theirs.\" She jerked her head in the direction of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Well, I kicked the shit out of my boss for copping a feel, got myself fired, again, I\u0027m marooned in a strange country, again, and I used my last fifty bucks to come fishing. I mean, how dumb am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain looked puzzled. He was a big man, wide through the shoulders, and quite a bit taller than she—and at five-ten, Christina wasn\u0027t short. He had bushy, salt-and-pepper hair, an equally bushy beard threaded with silver, and blue eyes that smiled even when his mouth didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dumb are you? About which part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The \u0027spending my last dime on this boat\u0027 part. I mean, hello, I could have waited until I found another job, right? Dumb. No excuse.\" She sighed and stared out at the ocean. \"But I just wanted to— wanted to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do something you loved for a change. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s so dumb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No excuse,\" she said gloomily. \"Work first. Assuming I\u0027ll be able to work in this country. I mean, I\u0027ve got a passport, but—never mind, I\u0027m getting off track. Because the rest of it, not so dumb. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Let him grab? Forget it. He\u0027s lucky I didn\u0027t kick his balls up into his throat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain was nodding, which cheered her up a little. \"Damn right. He got what he deserved. If somebody did that to one of my daughters ...\" His hands closed into fists that were, she observed, the size of bowling balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. No mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. We\u0027ve now established that kicking ass is the way to go. But that doesn\u0027t exactly help me out. I\u0027ve got to find a job. I guess first I have to find out if I can stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stay,\" the captain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nice, but I\u0027d better check it out for myself, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Uh . . . you look kind of familiar. Have I seen you on TV or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got that kind of face,\" he said vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Anyway, all my worldly possessions are in a locker at the library, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your folks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad took off when I was just a baby, and my mom died when I was in high school. There\u0027s just me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, that\u0027s too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was her turn to shrug. She certainly wasn\u0027t getting into the whole \"been on my own since I was sixteen\" thing. He seemed like a nice, friendly, older guy, but there were limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m—I mean, I was—a cook on a cruise ship. And spare me the whole \u0027cruise ships are ruining Juneau\u0027 speech—I\u0027ve heard it before from the townies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard it, too. We\u0027re working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. \"Seriously—you look really familiar. Are you sure we haven\u0027t met, or—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do when we get back to port?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027ll see if any of the hotels needs a caterer or—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can work for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. That\u0027s really nice of you.\" She was sincere, but being mate on board a fishing boat was not her idea of a good time. It was messy, it was hard work, the pay sucked, and the tourists were annoying. \"And I might take you up on it.\" Beggars, after all, couldn\u0027t be choosers. \"But I\u0027d better look around myself, first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain, am I going to have to kick your ass today, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haw! You\u0027re young enough to be one of my kids. I\u0027m too old for that shit. But I\u0027ve got a son, he\u0027s a little older than you—what are you, twenty-three, twenty-four?—and I think you\u0027d be—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up her hands like a traffic cop. \"No, thanks. The last thing I need right now is a blind date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, where are you sleeping tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously. Am I going to have to kick your ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again. It was comforting—he had a big, booming bear laugh—but strange. It was like he got a huge kick out of being threatened. Like it never happened to him, so it was funny when it did. Most people did not laugh when she threatened them with bodily harm. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-1.html","bookId":2789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM"}
