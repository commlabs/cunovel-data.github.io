You do like to manage other people\u0027s lives, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only when it\u0027s obvious I can do a better job of it than they can. What are you smiling at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan stopped, obliging her to turn to face him. \"You. You make me want to? He stopped as if thinking better of what he\u0027d been about to say. But the trace of amusement lingered on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t like the way he looked at her, the way he made her feel hot and nervous and giddy. All her senses informed her that he was a thoroughly untrustworthy man. One who abided by no one\u0027s rules but his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, Miss Hathaway ... what would you do if you were invited on a midnight ride across the earth and ocean? Would you choose the adventure, or stay safely at home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t seem to tear her gaze from his. The topaz eyes were lit by a glint of playfulness, not the innocent mischief of a boy, but something far more dangerous. She could almost believe he might actually change form and appear beneath her window one night, and carry her away on midnight wings ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home, of course,\" she managed in a sensible tone. \"I don\u0027t want adventure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 think you do. I think in a moment of weakness, you might surprise yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have moments of weakness. Not that kind, at any rate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter curled around her like a drift of smoke. \"You will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia didn\u0027t dare ask why he was so certain of that. Perplexed, she lowered her gaze to the top button of his waistcoat. Was he flirting with her? No, it must be that he was mocking her, trying to make her look foolish. And if there was one thing she feared in life more than bees, it was appearing foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGathering her dignity, which had scattered like bits of dandelion fluff in a high wind, she frowned up at him. \"We\u0027re nearly at Ramsay House.\" She indicated the outline of a roof rising from the forest. \"I would prefer to go the last part of the distance alone. You may tell the earl that I was safely delivered. Good day, Mr. Rohan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a nod, took her in with one of those bright, disarming glances, and stayed to watch her progress as she walked away. With each step Amelia put between them, she should have felt safer, but the sense of disquiet remained. And then, she heard him murmur something, his voice shadowed with amusement, and it sounded as if he had said, \"Some midnight...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news that they were to have supper at the home of Lord and Lady Westcliff was received with a variety of reactions from the Hathaways. Poppy and Beatrix were pleased and excited, whereas Win, who was still trying to regain her strength after the journey to Hampshire, was merely resigned. Leo was looking forward to a lengthy repast accompanied by fine wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen, on the other hand, flatly refused to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are part of the family,\" Amelia told him, watching as he secured loose paneling boards in one of the common rooms. Merripen\u0027s grip on a carpenter\u0027s hammer was deft and sure as he expertly sank a handmade nail into the edge of a board. \"No matter how you may try to deny all connection to the Hathaways—and one could hardly blame you for that—the fact is, you\u0027re one of us and you should attend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen methodically pounded a few more nails into the wall. \"My presence won\u0027t be necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weil, of course it won\u0027t be necessary. But you might enjoy yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I wouldn\u0027t,\" he replied with grim certainty, and continued his hammering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must you be so stubborn? If you\u0027re afraid of being treated badly, you should recall that Lord Westcliff is already acting as host to a Roma, and he seems to have no prejudice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like gadjos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My entire family—your family—are gadjos. Does that mean you don\u0027t like us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen didn\u0027t reply, only continued to work. Noisily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia let out a taut sigh. \"Merripen, you\u0027re a dreadful snob. And if the evening turns out to be terrible, it\u0027s your obligation to endure it with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen reached for another handful of nails. \"That was a good try,\" he said. \"But I\u0027m not going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primitive plumbing at Ramsay House, its poor lighting, and the dinginess of the few available looking glasses made it difficult to prepare for the visit to Stony Cross Manor. After laboriously heating water in the kitchen, the Hathaways hauled buckets up and down the stairs for their own baths. Everyone except Win, of course, who was resting in her room to preserve her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia sat with unusual submissiveness as Poppy styled her hair, pulling it back, making thick braids and pinning them into a heavy chignon that covered the back of her head. \"There,\" Poppy said with pleasure. \"At least you\u0027re fashionable from the ears upward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the other Hathaway sisters, Amelia was dressed in a serviceable bombazine gown of twilled blue silk and worsted. Its design was plain with a moderately full skirt, the sleeves long and tightly fitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy\u0027s gown was a similar style, only in red. She was an uncommonly pretty girl, her fine features lit with vivacity and intelligence. If a girl\u0027s social popularity were based on merit rather than fortune, Poppy would have been the toast of London. Instead she was living in the country in a rattletrap house, wearing old clothes, hauling water and coal like a maidservant. And she had never once complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have some new dresses made very soon,\" Amelia said earnestly, feeling her heart twist with remorse. \"Things will improve, Poppy. I promise.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-19.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:24 PM"}
