{"id":105348,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Tiff the barest glance before I had to peg a hand to Sensei\u0027s head, his hands trying to wrap my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff grabbed Clyde\u0027s hand and I thrust my power toward her like a spear, blindly hoping she could wield another\u0027s AFTD weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could. She did. Using it like a scalpel she held my zombie\u0027s hand and poured the death energy into his hand, mending it as I fought for my life, Sensei riding me, his fingers digging into my neck like talons. My vision began to dim and I heard Gramps yelling in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Clyde was above me, our eyes meeting, human understanding overriding his zombie nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a voice shout, \"Halt, police!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde and I hung suspended for a moment, then I gave the order. The only one that mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill, my mind whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not the word, but the intent he heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde put his hands on either side of Sensei\u0027s head and I felt the steel bands of his hands loosen from around my neck to release the hold on his head but too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde met his hands in a clap, Sensei\u0027s face collapsing under the force, a pressure not known in nature. A devastating blow that caused his features to meld in a dance of flesh, bone and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was instantly splattered with gore. I must\u0027ve passed out for a second because when I became aware again it was pandemonium. Garcia was screaming at Gale at the top of his lungs and she was crouched protectively in front of Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was under threat of fire from Garcia, a blue flame dancing on the end of a weapon made for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMade for the murder of a zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not Clyde. He was mine and I was his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, he was Gale\u0027s too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI staggered to my feet, swiping Sensei\u0027s brains out of my face so I could see, some of it landing with a wet splat on the mat. Clyde glanced at it, distracted with instant lust just as Garcia reached for Gale, latching onto her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I screamed with everything I had. I knew how Clyde would react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHissing, he tore Gale away from Garcia and put her behind him protectively, her small body covered by his. \"Do not lay hands on Roberta, Officer Garcia. I will hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia backed away, shifting his eyes to mine. \"What in the blue fuck is going on here, Caleb!\" he said on a voice stressed to breaking, all semblance of civility, any presence of mind that told him there were teens around, bystanders. Gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUtterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even know where to begin. We had killed people here, my zombie had. Alex lay bleeding and the girls needed medical attention. I could hardly talk because of my abused throat. But I opened my mouth to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Parker showed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould things get any more screwed to Sunday if I\u0027d wished for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia swung his gun to Parker and he smiled in response. Man he was a cool customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBred from merciless deeds, I thought cryptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay where you are,\" Garcia said, on the edge of doing things he swore he\u0027d never do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps put Jade on her feet and she got behind him, looking at me. I strode over to her. She met me, burying her face in my chest. She just missed the brain splatter by an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hurt?\" I whispered against her hair, the smell of vanilla a shock to my senses, blood and violence the only scent I\u0027d had in the last hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, turning her face into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Parker. I think hate was not a strong enough emotion but it\u0027d have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hands out in front of him. \"I\u0027m sorry, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing, Parker,\" I replied, my voice raspy from the fun with Sensei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I know this has gotten out of hand but we had an agent assigned for your protection and a Kamikaze for the Morris girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my eyes narrow to slits and he watched my expression. \"I wasn\u0027t in charge of her execution. That was a directive above me. All I could do was assign one of my agents to protect you. Jade, well, I couldn\u0027t do anything about her safety when Agent Rogers went rogue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head was spinning. I was furiously trying to make sense of it all when Parker\u0027s zombies strolled in, loaded with weapons everywhere. I\u0027d never seen better armed... anybody. The one that we had screwed up pretty good by the forest was as good as new. Obviously Parker could remake his zombie\u0027s like clay. Refashioned at will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia said, \"I don\u0027t care how much I have to work and how many strings are pulled. You\u0027re going to go down, Parker. You can\u0027t just mess with these teen\u0027s lives anytime you feel like it, you\u0027re not above the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker ignored him, his zombies eying the flame nervously, shifting the heaviness of their weight as they flanked Parker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker stared at me and Gramps said, \"Is this the one that keeps cropping up like a bad penny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, as explanations went, it wasn\u0027t too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Agent Tracker,\" Parker said to one of the zombies, who returned, holding up a beaten Buddy. Only his eyes looked whole out of a face with a mask of bruises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker inclined his head toward me. \"He wasn\u0027t interested in following directions at the end. He became attached to the subject, the target. Big mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy glared at him. Or should I start thinking about him with his real name, Tracker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy and Sophie came in and she looked at him. I could see her torn. Stay with Jonesy or go to Buddy, her face said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy made up her mind for her. \"Don\u0027t go near him, Soph. We don\u0027t know who he really is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy/Tracker looked at her. \"You know I wouldn\u0027t hurt you, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him for several moments then nodded her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe relaxed and she asked, \"I... I just have to know, what is your real name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted his gaze to Parker and he shrugged. \"Logan Tracker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re a Graysheet?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows rose on his butchered face and he winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they call us,\" Parker explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an agent for the government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt so enlightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough, Tracker.\" He looked at the zombie who held him. \"Bring him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker looked back at me and said, \"I think you know what will happen, Caleb. I know about your latest episode with LeClerc. Have you asked yourself what the consequence is of using your life-force? What it does to the person that receives it? The person that gave it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must\u0027ve looked confused because Parker sent a call to the dead that I felt echo in my bones, thrumming so hard my teeth ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zombie entered the dojo I would have recognized anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the warrior that I had juiced with the life-force of the Graysheet when Jonesy had downed the chopper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked as alive as Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade turned to look at him and he gave his steady regard to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then turned his glittering eyes to Parker who said, \"This is who made you.\" The zombie turned his attention back to me and breathed, \"Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Gramps had had enough. \"Okay, I hate to break up old reunion day but I want some cotton-pickin\u0027 answers and I want them yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s arm began shaking with the effort to hold the glowing flame on the zombies. Finally, he let it drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not answer to you, Dear Sir. This is between Caleb and I. He will be my partner, not now but someday. Whether he resists me or not. He will be my salvation. My release. Until that time, I give you caution.\" His dark eyes studied mine. \"You have unleashed two consequences upon yourself that will not go away. The first is the life-transference you caused between Miss LeClerc and Mr. Mason. The second is the obvious problem that stands at your left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Clyde, who had Gale pressed in his arms in the same way I did with Jade and a horrible feeling of finality stole over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw my expression and nodded. \"He is becoming, Caleb. He will have needs. Human needs. You restored him and all he needs is a living battery for life.\" He clenched his fist and held it above his heart. \"An AFTD battery. If not you, another will suffice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes bored into mine and I finally understood. He could be human again, still zombie but live again. He needed an AFTD to do it but it didn\u0027t need to be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale and I looked at each other and her face held an expression I didn\u0027t want to see there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia scowled at Parker. \"Are you telling me that this... zombie doesn\u0027t need to go to ground? That he can have a... what? Relationship?! Are you insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker shook his head. \"Not insane, just right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me again. \"You\u0027ll come to me, Caleb. When you seek answers, I will be there to give them to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan Tracker broke away from the zombie that held him and ran for Sophie, she hesitated for a moment then met him where they crashed into each other. Ignoring his obvious injuries he crushed her to him and kissed her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him whisper that he loved her, his arms trying to keep her even as the zombie tore him off her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker backed out of the doorway with his zombies. The last one mine. It was a painful separation as he left. Sorta like sawing my arm off with a butter knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts eyes never leaving mine it said, \"I will wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracker was hauled away, his eyes glued on Sophie\u0027s, hers never leaving his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears glittered and ran, sluicing a pathway along the planes of her face to her jaw. Trembling crystal gems hung, then fell to dampen her clothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving more questions than answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia slapped the cuffs on my wrists and Clyde was literally frothing at the mouth, Gale pleading with Garcia to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes met Clyde\u0027s. \"Do nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde\u0027s face contorted with emotions he shouldn\u0027t have had. But he did. Because of me, because of Gale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should not have killed them, Master,\" Clyde said, his strange speech perfect from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps said, \"You can\u0027t arrest him! Those lowlife government saps were trying to kill him! His friends, the girls. Think Garcia!\" Gramps shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale opened her mouth to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia swung around and yelled in Gale\u0027s face. \"You... don\u0027t you talk to me. You\u0027re in love with this zombie, you aren\u0027t thinking with a clear head!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the metal bit into my wrists I watched Gale try to control her emotions. Clyde had wrapped his forearm around her chest, the main part of it underneath her chin, pressing her against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia looked at her with a disgust that bordered on hatred. She glared back at him. \"You\u0027ve never understood the paranormal, Raul. You\u0027re letting your prejudice and anger over this mess cloud your judgment. Don\u0027t arrest a sixteen-year old because he used Clyde to defend himself. If he hadn\u0027t he\u0027d be dead, or everyone would! See reason,\" she said, imploring him to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was merciless. \"It\u0027s Clyde now, eh? He\u0027s a corpse, Bobbi! Think about it.\" His eyes met hers and he hauled me off, Jade sobbing as I went, Gramps\u0027 arm around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps\u0027 eyes did a scan at the assembled cops that had come as back up and knew he couldn\u0027t offer any assistance but to watch me go to jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnyx had woken up and stood by Clyde, giving a lone and plaintive whine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI totally understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia loaded me into the back of the cruiser none too gently and slammed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe locks engaged and Gale was left with the back up cops on scene, the dead techs swarming around Graysheets that would never be identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde above ground forever, tied to Gale in a way that I couldn\u0027t fathom, hadn\u0027t planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade and Brett with some connection as a result of me using him as a tool to save her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd me facing possible criminal prosecution for intent to murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an undeadly weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-37.html","bookId":2492,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM"}
