Even blind, Alice wasn\u0027t slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth��masklike. He didn\u0027t fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he\u0027d chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren\u0027t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I finally said when he didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ground my teeth. \"She\u0027s not here. Do you need something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"You\u0027re alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to you a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth clenched together again. \"Chicken\" I mumbled under my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake\u0027s eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched��there was no other way to describe the way he moved��up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry��I didn\u0027t like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob?��before I shut the door on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slumber party?\" he asked, his tone sarcastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I answered with the same level of acid. I didn\u0027t like Jacob when he acted this way. \"What\u0027s it to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. \"Where\u0027s your \u0027friend\u0027?\" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about the room seemed to make him edgier��his long arms were quivering. He didn\u0027t answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. \"What\u0027s your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like having to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m sorry you had to come,\" I muttered. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what you need so you can leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn\u0027t take long. We have to get back for the funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Get it over with then.\" I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn\u0027t want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn\u0027t being fair. After all, I\u0027d picked the bloodsucker over him last night. I\u0027d hurt him first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into a serene mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the Cullens is staying here with you,\" he stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Alice Cullen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded thoughtfully. \"How long is she here for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as she wants to be.\" The belligerence was still there in my tone. \"It\u0027s an open invitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you could�� please�� explain to her about the other one��Victoria?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paled. \"I told her about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You\u0027ll only be safe in La Push. I can\u0027t protect you here anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away then, out the back windows. He didn\u0027t continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. \"Just one more thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, but he didn\u0027t continue. \"Yes?\" I finally prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are the rest of them coming back now?\" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam\u0027s always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam�� I wondered why that bothered me so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I didn\u0027t speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I said finally. Grudgingly. \"They aren\u0027t coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression didn\u0027t change. \"Okay. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him, annoyance rekindled. \"Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary monsters aren\u0027t coming to get you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he repeated, still calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again at how quiet he\u0027d become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn\u0027t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn\u0027t think of any better way, any perfect course of action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella�� ?\" Jacob asked in a troubled voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn\u0027t left when I\u0027d thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I realized I was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back to stand in front of me, ducking his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same level with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it again, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did what?\" I asked, my voice cracking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Broke my promise. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027S\u0027okay,\" I mumbled. \"I started it this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face twisted. \"I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn\u0027t have taken me by surprise like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to defend her against the judgments he\u0027d made, but something warned me that now was not the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I just said, \"Sorry,\" again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not worry about it, okay? She\u0027s just visiting, right? She\u0027ll leave, and things will go back to normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t I be friends with you both at the same time?\" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of the hurt I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head slowly. \"No, I don\u0027t think you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed and stared at his big feet. \"But you\u0027ll wait, right? You\u0027ll still be my friend, even though I love Alice, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look up, afraid to see what he\u0027d think of that last part. It took him a minute to answer, so I was probably right not to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ll always be your friend,\" he said gruffly. \"No matter what you love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. \"This sucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Then he sniffed my hair and said, \"Ew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. \"Why does everyone keep doing that to me? I don\u0027t smell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled a little. \"Yes, you do��you smell like them. Blech. Too sweet��sickly sweet. And�� icy. It burns my nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. \"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wiped his smile away. \"Huh. Maybe I don\u0027t smell so good to her, either. Huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you both smell fine to me.\" I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22��on the one hand, I wanted Alice to stay forever. I was going to die��metaphorically��when she left me. But how was I supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess, I thought again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss you,\" Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. \"Every minute. I hope she leaves soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It really doesn\u0027t have to be that way, Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Yes, it really does. Bella. You�� love her. So I\u0027d better not get anywhere near her. I\u0027m not sure that I\u0027m even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke the treaty, and\"��his voice turned sarcastic��\"you probably wouldn\u0027t like it too much if I killed your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me escape. \"There\u0027s no point in avoiding the truth. That\u0027s the way things are, Bells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not like the way things are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me look at him. \"Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, I knew there was nothing but wistful sadness��I didn\u0027t want to have to say goodbye now, no matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked away, his expression changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble��not with anger this time. He pressed his palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I hadn\u0027t made this decision yet. I didn\u0027t know if I could do this, and now I was out of time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right now, I could choose to have him belong to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind that didn\u0027t break any spells?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it would be easy��like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn\u0027t feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled to react, even to take advantage of the distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swan residence,\" Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly remainder of my college f and that it was Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here,\" Jacob said, and the words were menacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added unwillingly, \"He\u0027s at the funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jacob hung up the phone. \"Filthy bloodsucker,\" he muttered under his breath. The face he turned back to me was the bitter mask again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did you just hang up on?\" I gasped, infuriated. \"In my house, and on my phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy! He hung up on me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He? Who was it?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sneered the title. \"Dr. Carlisle Cullen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you let me talk to him?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t ask for you,\" Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands shook. \"He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don\u0027t think I broke any rules of etiquette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You listen to me, Jacob Black��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he obviously wasn\u0027t listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Bells,\" he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran after him. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun around again, knocking me sideways. I bobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot, ow!\" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" she choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice, what\u0027s wrong?\" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" was all she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. I didn\u0027t at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice\u0027s bleak face and how it could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of unconsciousness before the reality could hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairway tilted at the oddest angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It felt like there was an earthquake��the couch was shaking under me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do to her?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice ignored him. \"Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay back,\" Jacob warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Jacob Black,\" Alice ordered. \"You don\u0027t want to do that so close to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have any problem keeping my focus,\" he retorted, but his voice sounded a little cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice?\" My voice was weak. \"What happened?\" I asked, even though I didn\u0027t want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she suddenly wailed. \"What is he thinking?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob\u0027s arm I was gripping for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now.\" Her voice whipped through the words. \"Fine, as soon as he\u0027s back. No, I\u0027ll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she gasped. \"Why would you do that, Rosalie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don\u0027t you think?\" she asked acidly. \"Yes, that\u0027s right. She\u0027s absolutely fine��I was wrong�� It\u0027s a long story�� But you\u0027re wrong about that part, too, that\u0027s why I\u0027m calling�� Yes, that\u0027s exactly what I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice\u0027s voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth. \"It\u0027s a bit late for that, Rose. Save your remorse for someone who believes it.\" Alice snapped the phone shut with a sharp twist of her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were tortured as she turned to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice,\" I blurted out quickly. I couldn\u0027t let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. \"Alice, Carlisle is back, though. He called just before��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me blankly. \"How long ago?\" she asked in a hollow voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half a minute before you showed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\" She really focused now, waiting for my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t talk to him.\" My eyes flickered to Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn\u0027t here,\" Jacob muttered resentfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that everything?\" Alice demanded, her voice like ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he hung up on me,\" Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told him Charlie was at the funeral,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice jerked her head back toward me \"What were his exact words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said, \u0027He\u0027s not here,\u0027 and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, \u0027At the funeral.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice moaned and sank to her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me Alice,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t Carlisle on the phone,\" she said hopelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you calling me a liar?\" Jacob snarled from beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Edward.\" The words were just a choked whisper. \"He thinks you\u0027re dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind started to work again. These words weren\u0027t the ones I\u0027d been afraid of, and the relief cleared my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn\u0027t she?\" I said, sighing as I relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn\u0027t she realize�� or care�� ?\" Her voice faded away in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral,\" I realized. It stung to know how close I\u0027d been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob\u0027s arm, but he didn\u0027t flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice looked at me strangely. \"You\u0027re not upset,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, someone will tell him�� what�� really��\" I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she\u0027d seen�� and Rosalie\u0027s remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if she\u0027d hurt her family, hurt her brother��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" Alice whispered. \"Edward won\u0027t call again. He believed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I. Don\u0027t. Understand.\" My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn\u0027t push the air out to actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Edward\u0027s voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I wasn\u0027t going to live without you, he\u0027d said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here in this very room. But I wasn\u0027t sure how to do it�� I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help�� so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi�� You don\u0027t irritate them. Not unless you want to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot unless you want to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO!\" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she\u0027d seen. \"No! No, no, no! He can\u0027t! He can\u0027t do that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he�� he left! He didn\u0027t want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew I would die sometime!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he ever planned to outlive you by long,\" Alice said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dare he!\" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself between Alice and me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!\" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate impatience. \"What do we do?\" I begged Alice. There had to be something. \"Can\u0027t we call him? Can Carlisle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shaking her head. \"That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in Rio��someone answered it��\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let\u0027s do it, whatever it is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, I��I don\u0027t think I can ask you to��\" She trailed off in indecision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask me!\" I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to emphasize her words. \"We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi�� and asking to die.\" We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the tears. \"It all depends on what they choose. I can\u0027t see that till they make a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if they say no, and they might��Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn\u0027t want to offend him��Edward has a backup plan. They\u0027re very protective of their city. If Edward does something to upset the peace, he thinks they\u0027ll act to stop him. And he\u0027s right. They will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I\u0027d heard nothing yet that would explain why we were still standing here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if they agree to grant his favor, we\u0027re too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a plan to offend them quickly enough, we\u0027re too late. If he gives into his more theatrical tendencies�� we might have time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only knows too much, but also smells too good. There\u0027s a very good chance that they will eliminate us all��though in your case it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewon\u0027t be punishment so much as dinnertime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what\u0027s keeping us here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"I\u0027ll go alone if you\u0027re afraid.\" I mentally tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only afraid of getting you killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted in disgust. \"I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You write a note to Charlie. I\u0027ll call the airlines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie,\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to let anything happen to Charlie.\" Jacob\u0027s low voice was gruff and angry. \"Screw the treaty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, Bella,\" Alice interrupted urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad, I wrote. I\u0027m with Alice. Edward\u0027s in trouble. You can ground me when I get back. I know it\u0027s a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go,\" Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t about to waste time arguing with him. \"Please, please, please take care of Charlie,\" I said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get your wallet��you\u0027ll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don\u0027t have time to forge one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, like all her plans, it had fallen through. But not before I\u0027d made all the practical arrangements I could for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The sense of deja vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time��when I\u0027d run away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them��I wouldn\u0027t have to say goodbye to Charlie in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, standing so far apart you wouldn\u0027t assume at first that they were having a conversation. Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you\u0027re taking her to��\" Jacob was furiously accusing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You\u0027re right, dog.\" Alice was snarling, too. \"The Volturi are the very essence of our kind��they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I\u0027m not unaware of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think she\u0027d be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can handle the redhead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why is she still hunting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that!\" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. \"Argue when we get back, let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically to turn and lock the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. \"Please, Bella. I\u0027m begging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, I have to��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t, though. You really don\u0027t. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For Charlie. For me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine of Carlisle\u0027s Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice revved it impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, and he didn\u0027t fight me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t die, Bella,\" he choked out. \"Don\u0027t go. Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I never saw him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear-wet face against his chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Jake.\" I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn\u0027t bear to look at his face. \"Sorry,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I spun and raced for the car. The door on the passenger side was open and waiting. I threw my backpack over the headrest and slid in, slamming the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of Charlie!\" I turned to shout out the window, but Jacob was nowhere in sight. As Alice stomped on the gas and��with the tires screeching like human screams��spun us around to face the road, I caught sight of a shred of white near the edge of the trees. A piece of a shoe. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-19.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
