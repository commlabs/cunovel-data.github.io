Both hunters face each other—but only for a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane dives low, snatching cloth at the ankle and throwing his body to the side, yanking the prey’s limb from under him. The other falls, head striking broken stone. Goggles knock away, revealing narrowed eyes. Kane smells his fear, still tastes the blood on the back of his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the other is a hunter, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of a blade in the other hand. It stabs down—but Kane is already gone, spinning away, running low into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not without a hard-won prize clutched in his jaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:25 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sprinted along the barrier fencing as fresh gunfire erupted from the construction zone: the chugging coughs of automatic weapons along with the sharper blasts of smaller arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment ago, as he reached the street, he’d heard the initial pistol cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had risen from a different part of the site, well away from the current firefight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad to be Captain Wayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was confirmed when Gray heard Tucker’s radioed command to his partner. There was no sign of the man on the street, so Gray rushed toward a gate at the next corner. He found it unguarded and pushed inside, his gun already in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bulldozed road led straight toward the fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted bodies on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmur’s men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray ducked to the side, into the shadows of a pile of broken concrete. A commando stepped into view and kicked one of the bodies. An arm lifted off the ground, a pleading gesture. The soldier’s pistol pointed down. A single crack, and the arm fell limply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were killing everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs quickly as the firefight had started, it ended. The last few sputters of automatic gunfire died away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray subvocalized into his throat mike. “Tucker, respond?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer didn’t come from his radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fresh flurry of gunfire erupted to the left, away from the pile of dead bodies. The commando in view dashed in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting back a curse, Gray rolled around the pile of concrete and headed that way, too. Gunplay spattered out, as Tucker played cat and mouse with the hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray struggled through the maze, straining to track the gunfire, while keeping a watch around him. At last, he spotted Tucker. The man, pistol in hand, ran along a row of parked dump trucks at the edge of the rubble field, trying to stay out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray headed toward him—but before he could take more than three steps, a shadowy figure appeared a few yards ahead, his back to Gray, blocking the view. It was the same commando who had been slaughtering the last of Amur’s men. The soldier spotted Tucker and fired a flurry of rounds at his target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicochets pinged off the dump truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExposed, Tucker tried to twist away. But a round struck him square in the chest, knocking him against the bed of the dump truck with a loud clang. He fell hard to the ground, his pistol flying from his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray raised his own weapon, strode two fast paces, and shot the commando through the back of the neck. The soldier collapsed to his knees, then to his face, gurgling harshly as he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stepped past him, kicking the assault rifle away from his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Tucker struggled to stand up, a palm on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamned lucky the man had been wearing a Kevlar vest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut luck only lasted for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fresh crack of a pistol came from the right, from out of Gray’s field of view. Tucker ducked as a round buzzed his ear and struck the dump truck’s huge tire. More shots rang out, blasting sand from between Tucker’s legs and by his left hand. Tucker scrabbled away, disappearing from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hurried forward, but the shooter was still out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere—?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the commando burst into the open, running low, heading toward where Tucker had vanished, pistol raised forward. His other arm was clutched to his chest, his wrist held at an impossible angle, dripping blood. Judging by the wild blasts, fury fueled this attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray struggled to fix the attacker in his sights, but the target was moving too fast and heavily armored. Gray fired anyway, emptying his weapon. But the soldier was so focused he didn’t even flinch from the rounds pinging off the truck’s side, even at a shot that glanced off his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his target was out of sight again, pursuing Tucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray ran forward, ejecting his spent magazine and slapping in another. In a few more steps, he spotted the gunman leaning over Tucker. His teammate, one shoulder bloodied, was sprawled on his back by the truck’s cab. The armored commando held his pistol at Tucker’s face, ready to shoot point-blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray could not stop him—then a miracle happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:26 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smoking barrel of the pistol lowered and pointed between Tucker’s eyes. His shoulder burned, but not as much as his blood. He stared past the gun to the eyes of the assassin. He recognized the fury there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt matched his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the gunman ran up, Tucker had spotted his broken wrist, the ripped bloodied flesh. He recognized Kane’s handiwork. This was the commando who had threatened his partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the other’s eyes, he read the satisfaction of the kill to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt matched his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fierce growl erupted from the shadows, drawing the gunman’s attention. His pistol jerked in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the distraction, Tucker yanked out the rifle hidden under the truck—the commando’s own weapon. He twisted the barrel forward and fired at the gunman’s face, blowing him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his body fell away, Gray appeared behind him, racing forward—then skidding back in surprise. “How … where did you get …?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker, still on his back, turned to the shadows under the dump truck. Kane crouched there, panting, his eyes glowing brightly out of the darkness. As commanded, his partner had not only taken down his opponent but also disarmed him. Tucker pictured his partner dragging the rifle by its leather strap in his teeth, ever obedient, obeying down to the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good boy,” Tucker said, staring back into those clever eyes. “Good boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:35 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray headed down the street toward Hotel Jubba. After he found Tucker, the pair had quickly retreated out of the construction area. They found no further resistance. With the mission completed, the remaining commandos—likely hired mercenaries—had pulled out and vanished into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever had employed those assassins plainly wanted Amur silenced. His inquiries must have alerted the pirates involved in Amanda’s kidnapping and triggered this swift reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Gray and Tucker were back among the street throngs in the new section of the city, stopping only long enough to bandage Tucker’s shoulder. Luckily the bullet had only grazed his upper arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker finished explaining what happened. “From the video feed, I saw that Kane had retreated somewhere among these dump trucks and went looking for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you got ambushed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker scowled and glanced down at the dog at his side. He’d stripped off the dog’s vest and held it bundled under his good arm. “I wasn’t leaving him in harm’s way, commander. And I never will. Kane looks after me with equal diligence. I wouldn’t be alive now if it wasn’t for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you wouldn’t have been in danger if you’d obeyed orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gray let that lie for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker continued. “Once at the trucks, Kane must have tracked me down, keeping hidden, closing in on my scent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he brought you that rifle.” Gray could not keep the tinge of respect out of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d ordered him to disarm his opponent. He’d been trained well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray suspected such coordination went beyond training, that it had more to do with an inexplicable bond between dog and handler, tying them together by something deeper than just hand signals and spoken commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the reason, they’d all made it out with only a few scrapes and scratches. Amur’s group might have been killed—silenced by the hired assassination team—but because of Kane’s help, they now knew the president’s daughter was being held somewhere in the Cal Madow mountains to the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Gray could formulate a plan of action from here, he noted the tumult outside of Hotel Jubba. Tables were overturned, stalls broken, windows shattered. Men sat in the street, nursing injuries. It looked like the aftermath of a small riot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” Tucker asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hurried to the steps of the hotel. He found the lobby equally ransacked. A televised soccer game played in the neighboring restaurant. A few men stood idly, sipping tea, amid the carnage of tables and chairs, as if nothing had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray touched his throat mike and radioed both Kowalski and Seichan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker shared a worried look with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they mounted the stairs. Their room—a two-bedroom suite—was on the second floor. Gray led the way down a tiled hallway, softened by a threadbare Persian runner. He kept his tread quiet as he approached the door. From inside, the cheers of an audience echoed out, coming from a television, likely broadcasting the same soccer match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pulled out his pistol and grabbed the door handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker held a palm toward Kane, readying his partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray burst into the room—only to find Kowalski sprawled in his boxers on the sofa in the suite’s common room, a washcloth full of ice held to his right eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski barely acknowledged them, still focused on the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray searched around the room. Nothing seemed amiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you respond to my radio call?” Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski stared sheepishly toward the table. His radio and earpiece rested there. He ran a hand through his wet hair. “I took a shower and forgot to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray cut him off. “Never mind. What happened downstairs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski heaved his legs to the floor with a pained groan. “You said to cause a commotion when we got here.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-12.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
