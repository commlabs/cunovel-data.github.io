For the several long, sensuous strokes, they stayed in that silent connection of bodies touching from feet to hands, being skin to skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so beautiful, Georgia.” He kissed her. Hungrily, frantically, even as he kept the same steady rhythm. His cock pausing outside her entrance on every fourth stroke before he snapped his hips, slamming into her to the root. Withdrawing slowly. Dragging out this pleasure as long as possible. Their mouths breaking only long enough to suck in more oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia’s fingers squeezed and released as her body strained to match the rhythm of his. He wanted to feel that same clenching and unclenching sensation of her pussy around his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell kissed a path to the sweet spot below her neck. Then he rammed into her fast and hard on every stroke until she arched against him violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sexy wail burned his ear as her pussy clamped down on his cock. Her grip on his hands was almost painful as she rode out her orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strong pulses and pounding rhythm were so perfect, his own release caught him unaware. He came hard and fast. A head rush. A brain freeze. Free-falling into the abyss. Then nothing but the decreasing thud thud thud of his heartbeat in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia nibbling on his jaw brought him back to reality. He eased back and looked into the face of a satisfied woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the cramp in his ass, and in his arms, he wanted to stay right here with her, just like this—sweat-soaked, sticky and sated. Possibly forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cock was totally on board and his aches and pains disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his hips and she gasped. He whispered, “Again,” and lost himself in her, half-afraid he’d never find his way back, half-grateful that he’d found her at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn’t Tell McKay just as cuddly as a kitten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he’d rocked her body—twice—she’d expected a sweet kiss and then he’d pull back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after he’d ditched the condom, he’d returned to bed, tucking her body against his, trailing his rough-tipped fingers up and down her spine as her head rested on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’d be heavenly, if it weren’t freaking her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia couldn’t remember the last time she’d been held so tenderly in the aftermath of spectacular sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn’t that sad?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeck had fucked her and reached for the remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther lovers had fucked her and reached for their pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she didn’t have much experience with this…lying around in the afterglow type stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldn’t that make an awesome confession?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny thing, Tell. I’m not used to the snuggly routine because previous lovers couldn’t wait to get the hell away from me. Maybe they were disappointed in my bedroom skills, or maybe my O face is fugly, but sweetness after sex? Nope. Not familiar with that. So forgive me if I—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong? You tensed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a loser and a bad lover and too mortified to tell you, although you’ve probably already figured it out. “Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell put his fingers under her chin, lifting her face up. “Don’t go silent on me now, hot lips. What’s goin’ on in that beautiful head of yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, placing a gentle kiss on her lips. “Huh-uh. We were amazing. Together. There are two people in this bed, Georgia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Believe me, I know. I’ve never…” She rubbed her fingertips on the razor stubble that had sprouted on his jawline. “You’re just overwhelming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny wrinkle appeared between his eyebrows. “You don’t mean overbearing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I… For supposedly being in charge of my own sexual needs and sexuality, I don’t have much experience with men like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men like me,” he repeated. “Meaning what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia blinked at him, unsure the level of honesty she should strive for. Especially when he was naked and she was looking into a face that could make angels sing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, saying girly stuff like that will make him take you seriously—not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Georgia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men like you who have the moves. The experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound a little pissed off about that,” he said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at all. I’m not making any sense. Just forget it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. Take a deep breath and time to gather your thoughts, because I ain’t goin’ anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want to screw this up. “I acted like a cat in heat around you last week because I thought it might get you to finally see that I’m not the goody-goody I used to be. Now I’m worried you’re disappointed I wasn’t a tiger in the sack. And I didn’t live up to all the fantasies you’ve supposedly had about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus. Stop. You are sex on legs.” Tell let the backs of his knuckles outline her face. “I want the you that you are now. Not the girl who sat in front of me in history class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, she tossed off a flip, “Eh. She wasn’t that cool anyway. A bit of a prude, I’ve heard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traced a scar on his rib cage. “This has been awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate to bring this up now, but when do you plan to take me back to my car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you were stayin’ here tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you were seducing me I would’ve said anything to get naked with you.” Georgia kissed the frown lines bracketing his mouth. “I loved every second of it. But I do have to work in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can run you back to the rodeo grounds first thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell. That’s not the best option.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” His lips flattened. “You sure you ain’t embarrassed to be seen with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you hear me out without getting defensive and paranoid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia smiled at his gruff tone. “I don’t care who knows we’re together. I do care about the walk of shame tomorrow morning in front of people on the rodeo committee if I show up in the same clothes and sporting sex hair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding flashed in his eyes. “Damn. I hadn’t thought of that.” Then his lips quirked. “Sex hair, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the way you always mess with my hair? I’m sure I look like I just rolled out of bed after a wild romp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a good look on you.” He curled a hank of hair around his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re not mad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. But I expect you’ll stay with me tomorrow night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he would. “Motel sex is pretty hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re pretty hot,” he shot back with a sexy growl. “In fact, let’s burn up the sheets once more before I haul your sexy ass back to your car.” Tell flipped her on her back and rolled on top of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer belly rumbled like an empty railcar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squinted at her. “Why didn’t you tell me you were hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only hunger I cared about feeding was what I saw in your eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now who’s the sweet-talker? I’m still starved for you, sweetness.” He kissed her three times, each kiss lingered a little longer than the last. “But you ain’t gonna be able to keep up with my appetites if I don’t feed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia finished dressing and watched Tell tucking in his shirt and refastening his belt buckle. Something about getting dressed after experiencing such explosive heat together made her self-conscious of her rumpled state. She smoothed her hair and tugged her dress into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Tell was in her face, giving her the gentlest kiss while his fingers firmly held her chin. “Every time you get that embarrassed look, I’m gonna kiss it right off your pretty face. No matter where, no matter when, understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t being his playful, fun self. She wondered how many women knew this side of him. Rather than speculate, she just asked. “Are you always this intense after sex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat in his eyes didn’t dissipate. Tell slowly shook his head. “Apparently only with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove to a truck stop on the outskirts of town. Tell ordered the steak and egg platter while Georgia chose blueberry pancakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re lucky this place is open twenty-four hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up her hand and rubbed his lips over her knuckles. “I’d like to keep you tied to my bed for twenty-four hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed but held his molten gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That didn’t send you running away screaming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it supposed to? Because the thought of you showing me all your sexual tricks and making me come so many times I lose track sounds like an awesome way to spend a day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “You constantly surprise me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s me. Miss Unpredictable,” she said with an edge of sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t feel that way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother kiss to her knuckles. “Then you should be around me all the time.” He frowned and pulled his phone out of his pocket. “Hang on, I gotta take this. Dalton? Why’re you callin’ me this late? Uh-huh. No. That’s fine, but it sucks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll leave after the event tomorrow night. But just remember you can’t do this next weekend. I’ll be gone Saturday morning. Nah. I can do ’em Sunday but it’ll be late. Fine. Drive safe.” He laughed. “Fuck if I’ll tell you, perv.” Tell hung up and looked at Georgia. “Sorry. Dalton is goin’ to Colorado in the morning and won’t be back until Monday. Which means I have to head back tomorrow night after the rodeo so I can do chores Sunday morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia sighed. “I have to be here Sunday morning to wrap everything up. So much for us spending tomorrow night together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come by my place on Sunday when you’re done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused a beat too long before saying, “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell’s eyes were on her. “Something wrong?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissin-tell-rough-riders-13/page-20.html","bookId":2694,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM"}
