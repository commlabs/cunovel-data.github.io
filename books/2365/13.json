She knew the surgery procedures for the gallbladder, spleen, liver, appendix, and, most exciting, the heart. But Paige was frustrated because she was not doing the operations herself. Whatever happened to \"Watch one, do one, teach one\"? she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer came when George Englund, chief of surgery, sent for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paige, there\u0027s a hernia operation scheduled for tomorrow in OR Three, seven-thirty A.M.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a note. \"Right. Who\u0027s doing the operation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I ...\" The words suddenly sank in. \"I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Any problem with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige\u0027s grin lit up the room. \"No, sir! I... thanks!\" \"You\u0027re ready for it. I think the patient\u0027s lucky to have you. His name is Walter Herzog. He\u0027s in 314.\" \"Herzog. Room 314. Right.\" And Paige was out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige had never been so excited. \"I\u0027m going to do my first operation! I\u0027m going to hold a human being\u0027s life in my hands. What if I\u0027m not ready\"? What if I make a mistakel Things can go wrong. It\u0027s Murphy\u0027s Law. By the time Paige was through arguing with herself, she was in a state of panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went into the cafeteria and sat down to have a cup of black coffee. It\u0027s going to be all right, she told herself. I\u0027ve assisted in dozens of hernia operations. There\u0027s nothing to it. He\u0027s lucky to have me. By the time she finished her coffee, she was calm enough to face her first patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter Herzog was in his sixties, thin, bald, and very nervous. He was in bed, clutching his groin, when Paige walked in, carrying a bouquet of flowers. Herzog looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nurse ... I want to see a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige walked over to the bed and handed him the flowers. \"I\u0027m the doctor. I\u0027m going to operate on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the flowers, and looked at her. \"You\u0027re what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Paige said reassuringly. \"You\u0027re in good hands.\" She picked up his chart at the foot of the bed and studied it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\" the man asked anxiously. Why did she bring me flowers\u0027?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It says you\u0027re going to be just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed. \"Are you really going to do the operation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem awfully ... awfully young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige patted his arm. \"I haven\u0027t lost a patient yet.\" She looked around the room. \"Are you comfortable? Can I get you anything to read? A book or magazine? Candy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was listening, nervously. \"No, I\u0027m okay.\" Why was she being so nice to him? Was there something she wasn\u0027t telling him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, I\u0027ll see you in the morning,\" Paige said cheerfully. She wrote something on a piece of paper and handed it to him. \"Here\u0027s my home number. You call me if you need me tonight. I\u0027ll stay right by the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Paige left, Walter Herzog was a nervous wreck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, jimmy found Paige in the lounge. He walked up to her with his wide grin. \"Congratulations! I hear you\u0027re going to do a procedure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWord gets around fast, Paige thought. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever he is, he\u0027s lucky,\" Jimmy said. \"If anything ever happened to me, you\u0027re the only one I\u0027d let operate on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Jimmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, with Jimmy, there was always a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear the one about the man who had a strange pain in his ankles? He was too cheap to go to a doctor, so when his friend told him he had exactly the same pain\", he said, \"You\u0027d better get to a doctor right away. And tell me exactly what he says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The next day, he learns his friend is dead. He rushes to a hospital and has five thousand dollars\u0027 worth of tests. They can\u0027t find anything wrong. He calls his friend\u0027s widow, and says, \u0027Was Chester in a lot of pain before he died?\u0027\" \"No,\" she says. \"He didn\u0027t even see the truck that hit him!\" And Jimmy was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was too excited to eat dinner. She spent the evening practicing tying surgical knots on table legs and lamps. I\u0027m going to get a good night\u0027s sleep, Paige decided, so I\u0027ll be nice and fresh in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was awake all night, going over the operation again and again in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three types of hernias: reducible hernia, where it\u0027s possible to push the testicles back into the abdomen; irreducible hernia, where adhesions prevent returning the contents to the abdomen; and the most dangerous, strangulated hernia, where the blood flow through the hernia is shut off, damaging the intestines. Walter Herzog\u0027s was a reducible hernia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt six o\u0027clock in the morning, Paige drove to the hospital parking lot. A new red Ferrari was next to her parking space. Idly, Paige wondered who owned it. Whoever it was had to be rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt seven o\u0027clock, Paige was helping Walter Herzog change from pajamas to a blue hospital gown. The nurse had already given him a sedative to relax him while they waited for the gurney that would take him to the operating room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my first operation,\" Walter Herzog said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine, too, Paige thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gurney arrived and Walter Herzog was on his way to OR Three. Paige walked down the corridor beside him, and her heart was pounding so loudly that she was afraid he could hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOR Three was one of the larger operating rooms, able to accommodate a heart monitor, a heart-lung machine, and an array of other technical paraphernalia. When Paige walked into the room, the staff were already there, preparing the equipment. There was an attending physician, the anesthesiologist, two residents, a scrub nurse, and two circulating nurses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff were watching her expectantly, eager to see how she would handle her first operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige walked up to the operating table. Walter Herzog had had his groin shaved and scrubbed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes had been placed around the operating area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerzog looked up at Paige and said drowsily, \"You\u0027re not going to let me die, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige smiled. \"What? And spoil my perfect record?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over at the anesthesiologist, who would give the patient an epidural anesthesia, a saddle block. Paige took a deep breath and nodded. The operation began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scalpel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Paige was about to make the first cut through the skin, the circulating nurse said something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like some music, doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time she had been asked that question. Paige smiled. \"Right. Let\u0027s have some Jimmy Buffet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Paige made the first incision, her nervousness vanished. It was as though she had done this all her life. Skillfully, she cut through the first layers of fat and muscle, to the site of the hernia. All the while, she was aware of the familiar litany that was echoing through the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sponge... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a bovie. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like we got there just in time. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clamp. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suction, please. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige\u0027s mind was totally focused on what she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing. Locate the hernial sac ... free it ... place the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econtents back into the abdominal cavity ... tie off the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebase of the sac ... cut off the remainder ... inguinal ...ring ... suture it ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour and twenty minutes after the first incision, the operation was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige should have felt drained, but instead she felt wildly exhilarated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Walter Herzog had been sewn up, the scrub nurse turned to Paige. \"Dr. Taylor ...\" Paige looked up. \"Yes?\" The nurse grinned. \"That was beautiful, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sunday and the three women had the day off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should we do today?\" Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige had an idea. \"It\u0027s such a lovely day, why don\u0027t we drive out to Tree Park? We can pack a picnic lunch and eat outdoors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds lovely,\" Honey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do it!\" Kat agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang. The three of them stared at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus!\" Kat said. \"I thought Lincoln freed us. Don\u0027t answer it. It\u0027s our day off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no days off,\" Paige reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat walked over to the telephone and picked it up. \"Dr. Hunter.\" She listened for a moment and handed the telephone to Paige. \"It\u0027s for you, Dr. Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige said resignedly, \"Right.\" She picked up the receiver. \"Dr. Taylor... . Hello, Tom... . What? ... No, I was just going out. ... I see. ... All right. I\u0027ll be there in fifteen minutes.\" She replaced the receiver. So much for the picnic, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it bad?\" Honey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we\u0027re about to lose a patient. I\u0027ll try to be back for dinner tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige arrived at the hospital, she drove into the doctors\u0027 parking lot and parked next to the new bright red Ferrari. I wonder how many operations it took to pay for that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, Paige was walking into the visitors\u0027 waiting room. A man in a dark suit was seated in a chair, staring out the window. \"Mr. Newton?\" He rose to his feet. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Dr. Taylor. I was just in to see your little boy. He was brought in with abdominal pains.\" \"Yes. I\u0027m going to take him home.\" \"I\u0027m afraid not. Peter has a ruptured spleen. He needs an immediate transfusion and an operation, or he\u0027ll die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Newton shook his head. \"We are Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. The Lord will not let him die, and I will not let him be tainted with someone else\u0027s blood. It was my wife who brought him here. She will be punished for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Newton, I don\u0027t think you understand how serious the situation is. If we don\u0027t operate right away, your son is going to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked at her and smiled. \"You don\u0027t know God\u0027s ways, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was angry. \"I may not know a lot about God\u0027s ways, but I do know a lot about a ruptured spleen.\" She took out a piece of paper. \"He\u0027s a minor, so you\u0027ll have to sign this consent form for him.\" She held it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I don\u0027t sign it?\" \"Why ... then we can\u0027t operate.\" He nodded. \"Do you think your powers are stronger than the Lord\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was staring at him. \"You\u0027re not going to sign, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. A higher power than yours will help my son, You will see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige returned to the ward, six-year-old Peter Newton had lapsed into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going to make it,\" Chang said. \"He\u0027s lost too much blood. What do you want to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige made her decision. \"Get him into OR One. Stat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang looked at her in surprise. \"His father changed his mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige nodded. \"Yes. He changed his mind. Let\u0027s move it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you! I talked to him for an hour and I couldn\u0027t budge him. He said God would take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God is taking care of it,\" Paige assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours and four pints of blood later, the operation was successfully completed. All the boy\u0027s vital signs were strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige gently stroked his forehead. \"He\u0027s going to be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orderly hurried into the operating room. \"Dr. Taylor? Dr. Wallace wants to see you right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenjamin Wallace was so angry his voice was cracking. \"How could you do such an outrageous thing? You gave him a blood transfusion and operated without permission? You broke the law!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saved a boy\u0027s life!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace took a deep breath. \"You should have gotten a court order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no time,\" Paige said. \"Ten minutes more and he would have been dead. God was busy elsewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace was pacing back and forth. \"What are we going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a court order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for? You\u0027ve already done the operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll backdate the court order one day. No one will ever know the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallace looked at her and began to hyperventilate. \"Jesus!\" He mopped his brow. \"This could cost me my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige looked at him for a long moment. Then she turned and started toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paige ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never do anything like this again, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if I have to,\" Paige assured him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-13.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
