The planetary giant’s eyes went dim, and then its head exploded. By the time its body started to topple down, Meng Hao in black roc-form was back on the land mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in that very moment, his face flickered with surprise as a sense of imminent danger rose up inside of him. In the blink of an eye, he transformed from a huge roc back into an ordinary-sized human. At the same time, a black beam of light shot through the spot once occupied by his head. Even though it didn’t touch him, it left his cultivation base trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he not reacted when he did, the attack would have blasted into the head of his roc form. Although Meng Hao wouldn’t have been killed, he would have been seriously injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun around and saw a coffin some distance away. Floating in the air above the coffin was the face of an old man, who was staring at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant their gazes met, Meng Hao suddenly got the feeling that this old man was at the same level as himself. Considering Meng Hao’s current power, he was at a level past the peak of 9-Essences, and virtually anyone he met was someone he could fight with ease. However, when he looked at the face above the coffin, he was filled with a sensation of danger and crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flickered as he suddenly vanished. When he reappeared, he was standing only a few meters in front of the tenth shield. If he was a match for the old man out in the starry sky, then back in this location, with the power of the lands around him at his disposal, he could definitely crush him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all... on the land mass itself, the energy of the Vast Expanse was weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man above the coffin didn’t enter the land mass, though. He remained outside, looking coldly at Meng Hao. Then he looked at the thirty-meter wide shield, and his eyes flickered with a strange light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood there, a cold expression on his face. Then he lifted his foot and stomped down, causing a huge boom to echo out, and shockwaves to ripple out. As the blast echoed out, countless bizarre creatures in the area, creatures who didn\u0027t fear dying at all, were instantly killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, everything went quiet again. Outside of the broken ninth shield, there were still endless numbers of bizarre creatures. However, none of them dared to try to fight their way onto the land mass. Anyone who tried to get to the land mass, regardless of the level of their cultivation base, was killed in body and mind. Those who managed to escape were as rare as phoenix feathers or qilin horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence didn’t make Meng Hao nervous at all. He was trying to buy time, and could tell that the copper mirror was getting closer and closer. At the most, it would take half a day for it to appear in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was at this point that, beyond the vast army of bizarre creatures, fluctuations filled the starry sky as more than ten thousand figures appeared. Astonishingly, those figures were cultivators!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, as soon as they appeared, they radiated the aura of the Immortal God Continent. The other bizarre creatures in the area didn\u0027t seem surprised at all, but as for Meng Hao, his eyes instantly erupted with an intense, uncontrollable killing intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis aura, the aura of the Immortal God Continent, was something he would never be able to forget. That aura belonged to an enemy who had caused the Mountain and Sea Realm to be destroyed, the meat jelly to die, the parrot’s mind had to be erased, and had pushed Meng Hao to the brink of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the redness in Meng Hao’s eyes caused the entire area to seem somber and desolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as the saying goes, troubles come in pairs. In almost the same moment that the forces of the Immortal God Continent appeared, another group of ten thousand figures appeared from another direction. They were difficult to make out at first, but they were also cultivators. They didn\u0027t emanate the aura of the Immortal God Continent, but rather were surrounded by the mist of the Devil Realm. In addition to that, they were led by a muscular man, who was none other than... one of the 9-Essences experts Meng Hao had fought in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he saw Meng Hao, his expression became one of shock, and his killing intent intensified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao, on the other hand, smiled, a smile filled with icy coldness. He had already been focused on slaughter, but now, his desire to kill rose to greater heights than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn almost the same moment that he smiled, the forces of the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent flew into the gap which had been opened in the ninth shield, and headed down toward the land mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir deadly charge changed the situation on the battlefield. The other creatures in the army had been silent before, but now they began to roar and howl. They also joined in the charge, ensuring that masses of enemies were flooding through the hole in the shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took a moment for the land mass Meng Hao was standing on to begin to tremble from the force unleashed by the countless charging figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe army was vast, and scattered among their numbers were many powerful experts. Even the old coffin man had finally passed through the shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms echoed out. Meng Hao’s hair whipped about as he took seven steps forward. When the seventh step landed, the ground quaked as an enormous foot crushed countless enemies into a bloody pulp. Simultaneously, Meng Hao moved directly in front of the muscular man from the Devil Realm Continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s mind reeled; he had never imagined that the person he would be fighting today would be Meng Hao, nor could he ever have guessed that after mere handful of centuries that had passed, Meng Hao would have become so powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there was no time to ponder the matter. Meng Hao’s right hand pierced through his defenses as easily as a sharp blade through bamboo, and then latched onto the man’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is with you that my revenge begins.” As his hoarse voice echoed out, power erupted from his hand, and the 9-Essences expert exploded into pieces, destroyed in body and mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Meng Hao killed the man, eight figures appeared around him. Shockingly, these people were the most powerful experts among their various races and tribes, and they were joining forces in one massive attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight enemies. Meng Hao threw his head back and bellowed, causing numerous mountains to descend. However, he didn\u0027t send them to attack his enemies, but rather, caused them to cover over himself. In the blink of an eye, 100,000, then 1,000,000, and then 10,000,000 mountains were superimposed over him, creating a powerful shield defense. A moment later, the combined attack of the eight powerful experts slammed into the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seemingly endless group of mountains exploded. At the same time, Meng Hao fell back, slamming into one of the powerful experts behind him. His speed was such that his enemy was blasted into a haze of blood and flesh, his fleshly body destroyed. His soul flew out, which was incapable of doing anything to stop Meng Hao from escaping the encirclement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, the old coffin man’s eyes glittered, and he emerged from the coffin itself, looking like a specter. He took a step, appearing directly in front of Meng Hao. He extended his hand, and the full power of his cultivation base surged as he attempted to tap Meng Hao’s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just what I was waiting for,” Meng Hao said, smiling. Even as the man’s finger closed in, Meng Hao’s eyes flickered coldly. The old man’s face fell, but before he could react, Meng Hao waved his hand, creating four lines around the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spatial Sealing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four lines instantly transformed into a canvas. The power of the Spatial Sealing erupted out, and the old man was powerless to stop it from sealing him inside of the canvas!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he appeared in the painting, he immediately unleashed the power of his cultivation base, causing the canvas to burst into flames. Considering the incredibly high level of his cultivation base, the sealing was only powerful enough to hold him for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a moment was all Meng Hao needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned viciously, unleashing the power of his cultivation base, waving his hand as he summoned the Eighth Hex. Then came the Seventh, and the Sixth... all the way to the First. They transformed into long threads, combining into a net which he flung toward the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eight Hexes, combined!” As the words left his mouth, the net swept out to cover over everything in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net passed through countless enemy creatures as though they weren’t even there. No one could stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Paragon from the Immortal God Continent blinked in shock as the net passed through him. The minotaurs, the specters, the stone golems, the cultivators from the Immortal God Continent, all of the various living beings from the other locations... were swept over by the net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even the red bugs could evade it. They were small in size, but the net was dense. When it had spread out to its limit, Meng Hao made a grasping motion, and the net began to retract, returning through all the same beings it had passed on its way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net rapidly shrunk down into Meng Hao’s palm, until it was nothing more than a dazzling light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, every being surrounding him on the land mass began to tremble. Blood began to spray out everywhere... as they were sliced into ribbons. Some of them became gore that splattered around on the ground, others were turned into ash....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armies outside of the land mass gasped, and then everything went deathly silent. Despite the fact that the will of the starry sky was urging them to attack, their instincts and their terror caused them to look at the land mass with minds spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao remained calm, but his eyes shone with bright red light. He looked up at the old man sealed in the painting, which was still burning. The old man howled as he prepared to burst out from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stared at him coldly, then waved his hand. Once again, the scintillating net appeared, which he threw out to cover the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, the sealing power was far greater than before, and the old man was powerless to escape its effects. All he could do was let out an unyielding roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao turned his attention to the hosts outside in the starry sky. Surrounding him were countless corpses, so many that it was impossible to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. However, the image of him standing there, and the thought of what he had just done in the battle, became a powerful warning to everyone who remained alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who sets foot in here... dies!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1500\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1502\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1501","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
