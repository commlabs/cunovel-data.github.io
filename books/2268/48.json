And if Nikki were there, it would have been a likely guess that he was with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about Julian?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd man out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr the one to give Nikki away? Julian had known her since childhood. Knew her better than anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnew the cemetery. Had he come with them as a setup, knowing that the gunmen would hunt them down but not harm him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind raced. Julian had excelled in theater arts. But he was Oscar material, beyond a doubt, if he had pulled off the fear he\u0027d shown that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not Julian, then who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered walking by Madame\u0027s, and Contessa, the weird old marble-eyed seer, coming up to Nikki, giving her a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the woman in on it and trying to keep Nikki alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment it had been Nikki, Max, Julian, himself… and Madame D\u0027Orso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis footsteps quickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried toward the station, anxious to find Nikki, and even more anxious for Massey or Joulette to make it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" the desk sergeant called. \"You Nikki DuMonde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki nearly tripped over Julian as she hurried over to the man. She didn\u0027t get to answer. \"She\u0027s Nikki. Yup, that\u0027s her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant frowned at Julian, shaking his head. \"I got a call from the brass at the cemetery. Seems that the Blackhawk guy you\u0027re waiting for is going to be tied up with them for hours yet. He says to go home with Julian.\" He arched a brow as he looked at Julian, who had evidently driven him nuts with his pacing. \"I take it you\u0027re Julian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go home, with Julian?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ll have a couple of uniforms drop you off.\" He called out to two cops who had just come in. One was stirring a cup of coffee, looking worn-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stevens. Hurst. Need an escort for these folks. See that they get to the lady\u0027s apartment safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them nodded, looking tired but willing. \"Thanks,\" Nikki said. \"We could just walk. I don\u0027t live that far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I\u0027ll arrange a safe escort home, and that\u0027s what\u0027s happening,\" the sergeant said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than argue, Nikki nodded. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, thanks, we\u0027re outta here,\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne officer, whose badge identified him as Hurst, opened the door. Nikki and Julian thanked him and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re right there,\" Hurst said, indicating the car almost directly in front of the station. The second officer opened the rear seat for the two of them, and in seconds they were headed for Nikki\u0027s place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty cool, getting an escort,\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess. I\u0027m tired, too, but… I want to know what happened,\" Nikki said. \"We don\u0027t have any answers about Andy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will,\" Julian assured her. \"If there are answers to get, your buddy will get them. He\u0027s the real thing—a real what, I\u0027m not sure, but he\u0027s real, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This it?\" Hurst pulled up in front of Nikki\u0027s place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Officer, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki and Julian exited the police car. The officers did the same. \"We\u0027ll make sure you get inside safely,\" Hurst said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could probably take it from here,\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, we were told to see you inside safely,\" Hurst said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fiddled with the latch to the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it,\" Nikki said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth officers came into the yard and watched as Julian followed her toward her door. Feeling definitely guarded, Nikki walked up to the porch, inserted her key in the lock and twisted it, then turned to wave to the officers and let them know her door was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never made it. She was dimly aware of something long… metallic… flying toward her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was searing, white hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crashed to the ground, white hot gone to cold and ebony as the entire world faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent reached the station and hurried in. The sergeant at the desk looked up and greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Massey and Joulette back yet?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant shook his head. \"Not yet. Got the call, though. I sent your friends on home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Brent said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They called from the cemetery. I could hear all the commotion. He said I should send your friends home. Said you would be all night, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Who called?\" Brent demanded sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it was Massey. Or Joulette.\" The man flushed. \"I couldn\u0027t hear. There were sirens, but it came in on police band. Had to be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you let them go—you just let them go?\" Brent demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant looked flustered and defensive. \"I was told to. They\u0027re safe, don\u0027t worry. I gave them an escort. A police escort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By known cops?\" Brent demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant looked at him as if he were absolutely crazy. \"Of course they were known cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027ll give them a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at him hotly, the officer tried the radio. He looked slightly uneasy when he didn\u0027t get an answer. \"They\u0027re probably watching them… may be checking out the apartment. I\u0027ll try Hurst\u0027s cell phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" Brent said sharply. \"Send a car out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send a car!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent turned and burst back out of the station. He probably knocked over tourists, musicians and locals alike as he raced through the streets. As he ran, he heard a siren; the desk sergeant had finally called for a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached Nikki\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA police cruiser was parked in front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrenched at the gate, threw it open and nearly tripped over one of the officers. The man was clammy, but had a pulse. He left him and hurried to the next guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see blood on the man\u0027s temple, but he, too, had a pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was standing open. Brent raced for it. \"Nikki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran through the house, but he knew it was empty. A misty figure was trying to form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone… they got her!\" she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who, Andy, who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy shook her head… then cocked it. \"That car… that car… they have her… in that car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the revving of an engine then and raced back out of the house. Another cruiser was pulling along the street and parking. Two uniformed officers slipped out of it. \"Hey, buddy!\" one cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got two officers down,\" Brent said. \"They\u0027re alive. Call 911.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Halt or I\u0027ll shoot,\" one warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood still, gritting his teeth, knowing that if he told them what to do with themselves and ran, they would shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the freshly revved engine faded as the car took off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, call your sergeant. I\u0027m Brent Blackhawk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother car jerked up in front of the house. It was Massey and Joulette. Massey stepped out. \"What the hell happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two officers are down, Nikki and Julian are gone,\" Brent said. He still had his hands raised. \"Tell them who the hell I am!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment there was silence. Could Massey be in on it? Or Joulette? Or both? If so…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in the car!\" Massey called. \"He\u0027s with us. Get help out here!\" he shouted to the officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent raced to the car. He had no choice but to take the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoulette was driving. \"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get around the corner. Nikki\u0027s in a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What car?\" Massey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent stared at Massey. \"You tell me. You called the desk sergeant, sending her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell I did,\" Massey insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joulette?\" Brent said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t call anyone. And I told that to the desk sergeant,\" Joulette snapped. He was moving, starting to flip on his siren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Brent said quickly. \"Just get around the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoulette did so, muttering beneath his breath. \"This is nuts. Follow that car. What the hell car, are you going to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Brent grated between clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoulette went around the corner. There were a number of cars on the street. Brent groaned inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go out… get on I-10,\" Massey said. He picked up the radio and called for backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent turned and stared at him. \"That\u0027s where we found Tom Garfield,\" Massey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent leaned back in the seat, praying he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car grew suddenly chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no longer alone in the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom Garfield was next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost was looking straight ahead, his eyes fixed on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-10?\" Brent said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarfield nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent leaned back again. \"I\u0027m going to suggest, gentlemen, that you call the station and have Madame D\u0027Orso, nee Debra Smith, picked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" Massey demanded, looking back at him with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conspiracy to commit murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his side, Garfield looked at him and cocked his spectral head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was Brent who nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in her head awakened her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes, and the world was dead black. And still. She started to shift, trying to figure out where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she was completely disoriented. For several seconds she was aware only of pain and confusion. And then she remembered. She had opened her door. She had started to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd been hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho the hell had hit her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian? God, no.

Unless they had been in on it. No. Then the entire police force would have had to have been in on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut someone had called the desk sergeant—from the cemetery—to say she should go home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-48.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
