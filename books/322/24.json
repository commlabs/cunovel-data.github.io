{"id":20599,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. WHO WAS THE THIEF?","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Roswell rose the next morning he felt cross and out of sorts. His head still ached a little, and he wished he were not obliged to go to the store. But it was out of the question to remain at home, so he started about half an hour after the usual time, and of course arrived late. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are late this morning,\" said Mr. Baker. \"You must be more particular about being here in good season.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell muttered something about not feeling quite well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Putting his hand into his pocket by chance, his fingers came in contact with the key which he had made to open the cash drawer. Just as he was passing Mark, he drew it out and let it drop into the side-pocket of his jacket. So, if suspicion were excited, the key would be found on Mark, not on him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The critical moment came sooner than he had anticipated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A Mr. Gay, one of the regular customers of the bookstore, entered a few minutes later.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-morning, Mr. Baker,\" he said. \"Have you got a \u0027Tribune\u0027 this morning?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, here is one. By the way, you are just the man I wanted to see.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed, I feel complimented.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wait till you hear what I am going to say. You bought a copy of \u0027Corinne\u0027 here on Monday?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And handed me a five-dollar bill on the Park Bank?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I find the bill was a skilfully executed counterfeit.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed! I didn\u0027t examine it very closely. But I know where I took it, and will give you a good bill in exchange for it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I locked it up lest it should get out,\" said Mr. Baker.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He went to the drawer which Roswell had opened. Roswell listened to this conversation with dismay. He realized that he was in a tight place, for it was undoubtedly the five-dollar counterfeit which he had taken, and paid to the Secretary of the Madison Club. He awaited nervously the result of Mr. Baker\u0027s examination.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you find it?\" asked Mr. Gay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is very strange,\" said Mr. Baker. \"I placed it at the top of a pile of bills, and now it is gone.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look through the pile. Perhaps your memory is at fault,\" said Mr. Gay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Baker did so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" he said, \"the bill has disappeared.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you miss anything else?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No. The money is just five dollars short.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps you forget yourself, and paid it away to a customer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Impossible; I always make change out of this drawer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, when you find it, I will make it right. I am in a hurry this morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Gay went out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Has any one been to this drawer?\" inquired Mr. Baker, abruptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You always keep it locked,—do you not?\" said Mr. Jones.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And keep the key myself. Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I don\u0027t see how it could have been opened.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There was nothing peculiar about the lock. There might easily be another key to fit it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you don\u0027t suspect me, Mr. Baker?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Mr. Jones, you have been with me five years, and I have perfect confidence in you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you don\u0027t suspect me, sir,\" said Roswell, boldly. \"I am willing to turn my pockets inside-out, to show that I have no key that will fit the lock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well. You may do so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell turned his pockets inside-out, but of course no key was found.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How lucky I got rid of it!\" he thought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now it\u0027s your turn, Mark,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m perfectly willing,\" said Mark, promptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He put his hand into his pocket, and, to his unutterable astonishment and dismay, drew out a key.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t know I had this in my pocket,\" he said, startled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hand me that key,\" said Mr. Baker, sternly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mark handed it to him mechanically.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Baker went behind the counter, and fitted the key in the lock. It proved to open the drawer with ease.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where did you get this key?\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t know I had it, sir,\" said Mark, earnestly. \"I hope you will believe me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t understand how you can hope anything of the kind. It seems very clear that you have been at my drawer, and taken the missing money. When did you take it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have never opened the drawer, nor taken your money,\" said Mark, in a firm voice, though his cheek was pale, and his look was troubled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry to say that I do not believe you,\" said Mr. Baker, coldly. \"Once more, when did you take the five dollars?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did not take it at all, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you lent the key to any one?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir. I did not know I had it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know what to do in the matter,\" said the bookseller, turning to Mr. Jones, his assistant. \"It seems clear to me that the boy took the missing bill.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid so,\" said Jones, who was a kind-hearted man, and pitied Mark. \"But I don\u0027t know when he could have had the chance. He is never left alone in the store.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Roswell,\" said Mr. Baker, \"have you left Mark alone in the store at any time within two or three days?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell saw the point of the inquiry, and determined, as a measure of safety, to add falsehood to his former offence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir,\" he said, in an apologetic tone, \"I left him in the store for two or three minutes yesterday.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why did you leave him? Did you go out of the store?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir. A friend was passing, and I went out to speak to him. I don\u0027t think I stayed more than two or three minutes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And Mark was left alone in the store?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir. I had no idea that any harm would come of it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mark looked intently at Roswell when he uttered this falsehood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You had better confess, Mark, that you took the money when Roswell was out of the store,\" said his employer. \"If you make a full confession, I will be as lenient with you as I can, considering your youth.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Baker,\" said Mark, quietly, more at his ease now, since he began to understand that there was a plot against him, \"I cannot confess what is not true. I don\u0027t know what Roswell means by what he has just said, but I was not left alone in the store for a moment all day yesterday, nor did Roswell go out to speak to a friend while I was about.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There seems to be a conflict of evidence here,\" said Mr. Baker.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope the word of a gentleman\u0027s son is worth more than that of a match boy,\" said Roswell, haughtily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To whom do you refer, when you speak of a match boy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To him,\" said Roswell, pointing to Mark. \"He used to be a vagabond boy about the streets selling matches, and sleeping anywhere he could. No wonder he steals.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I never stole in my life,\" said Mark, indignantly. \"It is true that I sold matches about the streets, and I should have been doing it now, if it had not been for my meeting with kind friends.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As to his having been a match boy, that has no bearing upon the question,\" said Mr. Baker. \"It is the discovery of the key in his pocket that throws the gravest suspicion upon him. I must see his friends, and inquire into the matter.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course they will stand by him,\" said Roswell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We may get some light thrown upon his possession of the key, at any rate, and can judge for ourselves.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall keep you employed until this matter is investigated,\" said Mr. Baker to Mark. \"Here is a parcel of books to be carried to Twenty-Seventh Street. Come back as soon as they are delivered.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mark went out with a heavy heart, for it troubled him to think he was under suspicion. Theft, too, he had always despised. He wondered if Richard Hunter would believe him guilty. He could not bear to think that so kind a friend should think so ill of him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Mark\u0027s vindication was not long in coming. He had been out scarcely ten minutes when Roswell, on looking up, saw to his dismay Tracy, the secretary of the Madison Club, entering the store. His heart misgave him as to the nature of the business on which he had probably come.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He went forward hastily to meet him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How are you, Crawford?\" said Tracy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pretty well. I am very busy now. I will see you, after the store closes, anywhere you please.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh,\" said Tracy, in a voice loud enough for Mr. Baker to hear, \"it won\u0027t take a minute. The bill you gave me last night was a bad one. Of course you didn\u0027t know it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell turned red and pale, and hoped Mr. Baker did not hear. But Mr. Baker had caught the words, and came forward.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Show me the bill, if you please, young gentleman,\" he said. \"I have a good reason for asking.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly, sir,\" said Tracy, rather surprised. \"Here it is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A moment\u0027s glance satisfied Mr. Baker that it was the missing bill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did Roswell pay you this bill?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"For what did he owe it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am the secretary of the Madison Club, and this was paid as the entrance fee.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I recognize the bill,\" said Mr. Baker. \"I will take it, if you please, and you can look to him for another.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well,\" said Tracy, puzzled by the words, the motive of which he did not understand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps you will explain this,\" said Mr. Baker, turning to Roswell. \"It seems that you took this bill.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell\u0027s confidence deserted him, and he stood pale and downcast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The key I presume, belonged to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir,\" he ejaculated, with difficulty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you dropped it into Mark\u0027s pocket,—thus meanly trying to implicate him in a theft which you had yourself committed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell was silent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you taken money before?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I never opened the drawer but once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That was not my question. Make a full confession, and I will not have you arrested, but shall require you to make restitution of all the sums you have stolen. I shall not include this bill, as it is now returned to my possession. Here is a piece of paper. Write down the items.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell did so. They footed up a little over six dollars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Baker examined it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is this all?\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Half a week\u0027s wages are due you, I will therefore deduct three dollars from this amount. The remainder I shall expect you to refund. I shall have no further occasion for your services.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Roswell took his cap, and was about to leave the store.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wait a few minutes. You have tried to implicate Mark in your theft. You must wait till his return, and apologize to him for what you have attempted to do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Must I do this?\" asked Roswell, ruefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You must,\" said Mr. Baker, firmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Mark came in, and was told how he had been cleared of suspicion, he felt very happy. Roswell made the apology dictated to him, with a very bad grace, and then was permitted to leave the store.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At home he tried to hide the circumstances attending his discharge from his mother and his cousin; but the necessity of refunding the money made that impossible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was only a few days afterwards that Mrs. Crawford received a letter, informing her of the death of a brother in Illinois, and that he had left her a small house and farm. She had found it so hard a struggle for a livelihood in the city, that she decided to remove thither, greatly to Roswell\u0027s disgust, who did not wish to be immured in the country. But his wishes could not be gratified, and, sulky and discontented, he was obliged to leave the choice society of the Madison Club, and the attractions of New York, for the quiet of a country town. Let us hope that, away from the influences of the city, his character may be improved, and become more manly and self-reliant. It is only just to say that he was led to appropriate what did not belong to him, by the desire to gratify his vanity, and through the influence of a bad adviser. If he can ever forget that he is \"the son of a gentleman,\" I shall have some hopes for him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82481.html","bookId":322,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:52:29 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:52:29 AM"}
