{"id":12430,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35","content":"Locked in his own room, Jack went over and over that telephone conversation, regarding it from every angle, and seeking to establish a new plan of campaign upon his conclusions. He was inclined to believe that \"Mr. B\" was sincere in his intentions of quitting the game. His dealings with the man had shown him that like all really able liars he used as much of the truth as he could. At any rate he would soon know whether or not he had quit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But that \"Mr. B\" would now settle down to a life of respectability, Jack did not credit for a moment. It was all very well for him to talk about being \"tired,\" excitement gets into the blood and one finds onesself unable to live without it. The thing was to figure out in advance what new direction his villainy would take.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Looking at the matter in the whole, Jack could not be very much cast down. It was no small feat that he had accomplished in bringing this man to sue for a truce. For that\u0027s what it was, let him make believe all he liked. He, Jack, had stopped him in mid-career, and Mr. B was no ordinary vulgar crook, but a really stupendous figure in his way. And Jack told himself if he could stop the man, he ought to be able to catch him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had not the slightest intention of giving up the chase, of course. His adversary\u0027s threats had the effect of stiffening his resolution. His present problem was, how to make \"Mr. B\" think that he had abandoned all measures against him, while he prepared a new surprise. Jack was well assured that he would be closely watched.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s last remaining line of approach to the old man lay through Miriam. True, he had said over the wire that he had called in and paid off all his agents; but that this applied to Miriam, Jack doubted. Miriam would never be allowed to enjoy the pickings of so rich a goose as Bobo was supposed to be, alone. One way or another demands for money would be made. Surely he could find openings here.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The one trump card that Jack still held was that \"Mr. B\" with all his astuteness still believed that Jack was an obscure and ambitious youth whose sole motive in this affair was to make a name for himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upon these two facts, the connection between Miriam and \"Mr. B,\" and the latter\u0027s ignorance of his real identity, Jack built his new plan. It was inspired by the old maxim: \"Give a thief rope enough and he will hang himself.\" After several hours of hard thought, he had it roughed out, but one great difficulty remained to be solved. Supposing he dropped out of sight for awhile, how could he inform himself of what went on in his absence?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After lunch Bobo called him up on the long distance. Bobo and Miriam were honeymooning at Rodney Farms, that exclusive and extremely expensive country resort.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo\u0027s honeymoon was probably not of unalloyed joy. His voice was abjectly apologetic. \"That you, Jack? How\u0027s things?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pretty good.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The friendliness of Jack\u0027s tone heartened the other. \"I just called up to tell you we were coming back to-morrow for a day or so. Miriam wants to.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That so?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, she fired her maid to-day, and has to get another.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes?\" said Jack with more attention. Something stirred in the back of his brain. \"Has she got anybody in view?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, she\u0027s going to Miss Staley\u0027s Employment Bureau. Seems all the women up here get their maids from her. Why do you ask?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, nothing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all right for us to come?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I didn\u0027t want to take you by surprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s all right. As it happens, I want to have a talk with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo\u0027s voice faltered. \"Oh—! You\u0027re not going to—— You\u0027re not going to——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not yet,\" said Jack encouragingly. \"In fact, I was thinking of loosening the purse strings a bit on certain conditions.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, if you would! She drives me nearly crazy with her questions, why I can\u0027t get more money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, we\u0027ll talk about it to-morrow—while Miriam is out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s next move was to seek out Kate. To do this it was necessary to don the Pitman make-up, that he was heartily sick of now; he vowed it should be Mr. P.\u0027s final appearance. He found her in her little sitting-room, and first he had to tell her of the exciting events of the morning, concluding with the astonishing telephone conversation. Her face blanched a little, when she heard of the threat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you are satisfied, aren\u0027t you?\" she asked in an offhand tone, \"I mean if it\u0027s true that he\u0027s quit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let him get away?\" said Jack surprised. \"Oh, Kate!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kate hung her head blushing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The point is, are you satisfied to have me stop?\" Jack demanded. \"You know what you said.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think you ought to take unnecessary risks,\" she murmured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was sweet to Jack. In order to get more of it he made believe not to see her drift. \"As to that,\" he said carelessly, \"the risk is no greater than it\u0027s been right along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She shook her head. \"No, I feel he means what he says. It was a warning. He has a queer sense of fair play.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The enraptured Jack forgot Mr. B. and all else. \"Kitty, do you realize what you\u0027re saying!\" he cried. \"Do you mean you are satisfied I\u0027ve done my job, and are willing to marry me now? You blessed darling! We could get a license this afternoon. We don\u0027t need any further preparations, do we? Oh, what happiness!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wouldn\u0027t marry you at an hour\u0027s notice—or any man!\" said Kate with an indignation, somewhat weakened by the consciousness of her inconsistency. \"I need weeks to get ready in!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Weeks!\" echoed Jack with falling countenance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, days, anyway.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But will you, in a week?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you give up the chase of this man? Turn your case over to the police now. After all it\u0027s their business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A reaction took place in Jack. \"Oh, Kitty!\" he said in distress. \"How can I? All my life I\u0027d feel as if I\u0027d left my job half finished. I\u0027d feel as if I\u0027d been scared off. How could I respect myself? How could you respect me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She snatched her hand out of his. At first he thought he had offended her, but presently he perceived that she was moved by quite a different feeling. She was ashamed. She lifted an humble glance to his.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re right,\" she whispered. \"It was just a moment of weakness. I wouldn\u0027t have let you give it up really, when I had had time to think. How will you be able to respect me now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He rapturously repossessed himself of her hand. \"Kitty, you silly! Do you think I will be blaming you for loving me a little! How many times have I come to you ready to give up, and had you send me back into the fight again! This just equalizes things a little.\" He smiled at her teasingly. \"You won\u0027t be able to be so superior, that\u0027s all!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked at him with an odd shy light in her eyes that he had not seen before. \"You goose! If you knew!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let\u0027s get married anyway,\" he pleaded. \"There\u0027s no manner of sense in putting it off any longer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She shook her head \"No. We set a task for ourselves. Let\u0027s accomplish it first.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, tell me you love me, and I\u0027ll be satisfied.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know it. You\u0027ve always known it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But tell me in plain downright English.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After an interval of divine foolishness, they came down to earth again, and Jack recollected his new plans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve got a difficult and disagreeable job for you,\" said he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you ever hear of Miss Staley\u0027s Employment Bureau?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly. It\u0027s the best-known in town. All the fashionable women patronize it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miriam\u0027s going there to-morrow morning to engage a maid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want you to get the job.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good Heavens! Let me collect my wits! Lady\u0027s maid, I!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look what I\u0027ve been!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, it isn\u0027t that I mind! But could I get away with it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not? She wants a maid to do for her, I suppose, what you ordinarily do for yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How will I land the job?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Simply go there and register, and pay the fee, and turn down any other offers you may get. I guess they don\u0027t get many applicants that could compete with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Silly! There are references to be thought of.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s easy. Mrs. Delamare will provide one, and get others if necessary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is the object of my doing this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going to drop out of sight for a while, and I must have somebody to keep me informed of what goes on in Bobo\u0027s establishment while I\u0027m away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well. I\u0027ll do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The agreement was sealed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack spent the rest of the afternoon in arranging for the necessary references for Kate, in making certain inquiries at the steamship offices, and finally in looking up a friend of the old poverty-stricken days, one Stanley Larkin. He chose this friend because of a general resemblance they were said to bear each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Larkin worked in the freight office of a railway. At the sight of Jack his eyes widened in amazement. \"Good Lord! if it isn\u0027t Jack——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Robinson,\" put in Jack quickly, \"for the present.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Larkin was anything but slow. \"Sure, Robinson! It certainly was decent of you to look me up in this hole.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look here,\" said Jack, coming to the point at once, \"what kind of a job have you got here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rotten!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is there any reason why you shouldn\u0027t give it up for awhile?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"None whatever, if I could meet my board bill without it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you make a trip down to British Guiana for me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"British Guiana! Am I dreaming?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not that you\u0027d notice,\" said Jack grinning. \"Boat leaves Saturday. I\u0027m going with you part way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young clerk balanced the stultifying monotony of life in a railway office against the lure of the tropics. His eyes became dreamy. \"Will I go!\" he said. \"Only give me the chance! It\u0027s like a fairy tale!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good!\" said Jack. \"Let\u0027s have dinner together, and we\u0027ll arrange everything. It will have to be some out of the way place because I have to take precautions against being followed. Say Pezzi\u0027s on West Thirty-Fourth.
