She felt a dull ache as she remembered the love they’d somehow let slip away. The love of their early years…She never allowed herself to acknowledge the isolation they’d forced upon each other. She did now, and the sadness settled over her like a heavy rain-drenched coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to figure out precisely when it’d happened to them or why. His Tuesday-night mistress was a symptom of their alienation, not a cause. They were already drifting apart when she’d entered the scene. Slowly, through the years, Jacqueline and Reese had lost that closeness. They were both at fault; Reese was stubborn—but so was she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir marriage had eroded to the point that they were roommates more than partners, friends more than lovers. It happened to many couples—she’d heard enough veiled hints and outright confessions from other women to be aware of that. Still, it didn’t lessen her feelings of acute loss. Putting aside her thoughts, she reached for the briefcase and hurried to the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline phoned the nail salon from her car as she headed directly to Blossom Street. The renovations were going well, although parking was still impossible. Jacqueline suddenly realized Reese hadn’t told her where she should leave her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried calling him, but apparently he’d turned off his cell. Twice around the block turned up nothing. The street wasn’t wide enough for her to double park, either. After wasting a precious ten minutes in a fruitless effort to secure a parking space, she pulled into the alley behind A Good Yarn. It wasn’t the best area of town in which to leave an expensive car, and Lydia had warned them against using it, but Jacqueline didn’t have any choice. The alley was narrow and dark and she shuddered involuntarily as she quickly locked the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got to the construction site, Reese was nowhere to be seen. However, as soon as she arrived at the trailer, his project manager greeted her. Jacqueline couldn’t recall his name, although she was fairly certain Reese had mentioned the young man. It’d been a long time since she’d kept track of his employees’ names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” the youthful-looking man told her. “I know Reese was pretty upset about forgetting this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t any problem,” she murmured, stepping over a pile of rebar on her way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrumbling under her breath, she walked across the street and down the block to the alley entrance. Unfortunately the yarn store wouldn’t be open for another twenty minutes, or she could’ve walked through there. As she entered the darkened alley, Jacqueline’s anger increased steadily. No wonder her marriage was in trouble. Instead of greeting her personally, Reese had sent his assistant—as if he took for granted that she’d interrupt her entire day on his behalf. Next time he could damn well retrieve his own briefcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgruntled, Jacqueline was halfway into the alley before an eerie warning sensation crawled up her spine. She stopped and looked suspiciously around. Nothing. She relaxed and mentally chastised herself for being foolish. The sun had yet to clear the tops of the buildings and the area remained cool and shady. She moved forward two more steps and stopped again as the sensation grew stronger, more compelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer imagination was running away with her, Jacqueline decided. She’d watched one too many episodes of CSI. Still, her fear persisted, growing more intense by the moment. But she had to get to her car. What alternative did she have? It was either that or stand here all morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was no more than twenty feet from her Mercedes when two men stepped out from the shadows. They loomed in front of her, half-obscured by the darkness. Menacing. She couldn’t see their faces clearly but she saw their sneers. They were street people, she thought, unkempt and filthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do we have here?” one called to the other, who moved quickly to block her exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline broke into a cold sweat. Instinct told her to run, but she feared her legs were about to collapse. And in her heels, she had little chance of escaping if they decided to chase her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kindly get out of my way,” she demanded and was rather pleased with her bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kindly,” the second man, the taller of the two, echoed in a falsetto voice, raising his right arm and dangling his wrist. “We got ourselves a genuine lady here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“High society.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lots of money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now give it up, bitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline clutched her purse tighter against her side. “You wouldn’t dare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never could refuse a dare, could we, Larry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” the other man shouted, obviously angry that his friend had said his name. He pulled out a switchblade and brandished it in front of Jacqueline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her determination to remain calm, she gasped. The blade gleamed in what little light had broken through the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his arm as if he expected her to meekly hand over her purse, and Jacqueline realized this wasn’t a request but a command. Any resistance would surely be met with violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she wasn’t aware she’d released it, her designer bag fell to the asphalt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t touch that if I were you,” a brusque female voice shouted from behind Jacqueline. “Aren’t you on probation, Ralph? Be a real shame to see your sorry ass back in jail so soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Jacqueline a moment to recognize Alix Townsend’s voice. Alix, the girl she considered a felon and a crude punk rocker, had risked her own life and come to her rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay out of this,” Larry growled, baring his teeth at the two women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, guys,” Alix said, waltzing forward, “but this lady happens to be a good friend of mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline stayed where she was, incapable of moving. Even her breathing had gone shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry looked at the purse. “You want her for yourself,” he muttered. He clenched the knife tighter and raised it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clicking sound followed but the noise didn’t immediately register in Jacqueline’s mind. Then she understood. Alix carried a switchblade of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They can have the money.” Jacqueline didn’t care; she just wanted both of them out of this mess without getting hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, they can’t,” Alix yelled as the two men started toward them. “Get over to the yarn store.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Jacqueline didn’t know where she found the courage, but she scooped up her purse and swung it wildly at the two men. She’d paid seven hundred dollars for the Gucci bag and it served her well, connecting with a solid crunch against the shorter man’s head. Ralph howled with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on back here?” Lydia shouted from the rear door of her shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call 9-1-1,” Jacqueline screamed, panic raising her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix crouched forward, her arms outstretched with a switchblade firmly gripped in her left hand. The men looked at the two women and at the empty door frame where Lydia had stood only seconds earlier. They glanced at each other and then ran for it, racing past Jacqueline and Alix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they were out of sight, Jacqueline started to shake. The trembling began in her hands, and quickly moved down her arms and legs until it seemed that her knees had taken on a life of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Alix asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The police are on their way,” Lydia called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Larry and Ralph are gone now.” Alix wrapped her arm around Jacqueline’s waist and guided her through the back door of Lydia’s shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe table where they sat for their classes seemed a mile away before Jacqueline reached it and literally fell into a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I could’ve been murdered.” She’d seen the look in those men’s eyes. God only knew what they would’ve done to her if Alix hadn’t come into the alley when she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix,” she gasped. “You saved my life.” In that moment, Jacqueline wanted to call back every ugly thought she’d ever had regarding the young woman. She didn’t care what color Alix dyed her hair. The girl had saved her from a fate she could hardly imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix sat down next to her, and Jacqueline soon noticed that she was badly shaken, too. She’d put on a brave front when she confronted the two men, but she’d been terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA siren blared outside and Lydia dashed to the front of the store to wait for the patrolmen. A few minutes later, two police officers entered the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three women started talking at once. Jacqueline felt she should be the one to explain; she was the one who’d been accosted, after all. She continued speaking, raising her voice in order to be heard above the other two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One at a time, ladies,” the first officer said, holding up his hand. He was young and clean-cut and reminded her of her son. Paul would be outraged when he learned she’d nearly been mugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer started with Jacqueline and when he’d finished, he asked Alix a few questions and finally Lydia. Each woman described the men in slightly different ways, although Alix seemed reluctant to discuss the matter. At first she didn’t reveal their names, but if Alix had forgotten, Jacqueline hadn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith their descriptions known, plus their first names, it made sense that the two hoodlums would be apprehended shortly. Jacqueline had already decided to press charges. All the while she was speaking, she clutched her Gucci bag with both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two know each other?” the patrolman asked, glancing from Jacqueline to Alix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Jacqueline said. “We’re taking knitting classes together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Alix muttered, and defiantly tilted her chin in their direction as if daring him to challenge her. “Jacqueline and I are friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She saved me from God knows what,” Jacqueline murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer shook his head. “It would’ve been smarter just to give them your purse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline knew he was right. All the survival manuals stated that in such a situation, the best course of action was to drop the purse and run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the policemen had left, Jacqueline looked over at Alix who remained seated at the table across from her. “I don’t know how to thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You owe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline nodded in full agreement. She still wasn’t sure what had led Alix into the alley. When questioned by the police she explained that she’d seen Jacqueline go in there and didn’t think it was a safe place for her friend to be. So she’d followed her. And Jacqueline would be forever grateful that she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer one concern was that she owed Alix now. She could only speculate what the girl would want as payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAROL GIRARD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT he two days following the IVF procedure had been the worst. The specialist had instructed Carol to stay perfectly still for forty-eight hours. The enforced rest got on her nerves after only a few hours, but with every breath she drew, with every solid beat of her heart, she made herself think positive, nurturing thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was all too aware that she was at the very end of the road, technologically speaking, for a biological child. She and Doug had decided this was it. They got their three chances through the insurance company and two of them were gone. IVF was expensive, time-consuming, unpredictable and uncertain. Correction, some aspects of the procedure were a certainty. Injections, frequent bloodwork and ultrasounds. She’d been poked and prodded so often she barely noticed it anymore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-24.html","bookId":1933,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM"}
