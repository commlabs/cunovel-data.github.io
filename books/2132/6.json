What good\u0027s Wulfgar done for ye, Arumn Gardpeck? What good ever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArumn narrowed his eyes and stared hard at the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And every fight he stopped was one he started,\" Josi added. \"Bah, he\u0027s gone, and good enough for him, and good enough for all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d ye put the warhammer?\" Arumn pressed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosi threw up his hands and spun away, but Arumn wouldn\u0027t let him go that easily. He grabbed the little man by the shoulder and whipped him about violently. \"I asked ye twice already,\" he said grimly. \"Don\u0027t ye make me ask again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone,\" Josi replied. \"Just gone, and far enough so that Wulfgar couldn\u0027t call to the thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone?\" Arumn echoed. His expression grew sly, for he understood Josi better than to think the man had simply thrown so wondrous a weapon into the ocean. \"And how much did ye get for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosi stuttered a protest, waved his hand and stammered again, which only confirmed Arumn\u0027s suspicions. \"Ye go get it back, Josi Puddles,\" the tavernkeeper instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosi\u0027s eyes widened. \"Cannot-\" he started to say, but Arumn grabbed him by the shoulder and the seat of his pants and ushered him along toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go get it back,\" Arumn said again, no room for debate in his stern tone, \"and don\u0027t come back to me until ye got the hammer in hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I cannot,\" Josi protested. \"Not with that crew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then ye\u0027re not welcome here anymore,\" Arumn said, shoving Josi hard through the door and out into the street. \"Not at all, Josi Puddles. Ye come back with the hammer, or ye don\u0027t come back!\" He slammed the door, leaving a stunned Josi out in the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skinny man\u0027s eyes darted around, as if he expected some thugs to step out and rob him. He had good cause for concern. Arumn\u0027s Cutlass was Josi\u0027s primary affiliation and, in a sense, his source of protection on the streets. Few bothered with Josi, mostly because he wasn\u0027t worth bothering with, but mainly because troubling Josi would shut down all routes to the Cutlass, a favorite place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosi had made more than few enemies on the street, and once word spread that he and Arumn had fallen out. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get back in Arumn\u0027s favor, but when he considered the necessary task before him, his knees went weak. He had sold Aegis-fang cheaply to a nasty pirate in a wretched drinking hole, a place he visited as rarely as possible. Josi\u0027s eyes continued to dart all around, surveying Half-Moon Street and the alleys that would take him to the private and secret drinking hole by the docks. Sheela Kree would not be there yet, he knew. She would be at her ship, Leaping Lady. The name referred to the image of Sheela Kree leaping from her ship to that of her unfortunate victims, bloody saber in hand. Josi shuddered at the thought of meeting her on the very deck where she was known to have tortured dozens of innocent people to horrible deaths. No, he decided, he would wait to meet with her at the drinking hole, a place a bit more public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man fished through his pockets. He still had all the gold Sheela had paid him for Aegis-fang and a couple of his own coins as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hardly thought it enough, but with Arumn\u0027s friendship at stake, he had to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s wonderful to be with ye,\" Delly Curtie said, running her hand over Wulfgar\u0027s huge, bare shoulder, which drew a wince from the big man. That shoulder, like every other part of his body, had not escaped the battering at the Cutlass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar muttered something unintelligible and rose from the bed, and while Delly\u0027s hands continued to caress him, he continued to ignore the touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are ye sure ye\u0027re wantin\u0027 to leave already?\" the woman asked in a seductive manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar turned to regard her, stretching languidly on the rumpled bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m sure,\" he grumbled as he pulled on his clothes and headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly started to call out after him but bit back her begging. She started to scold him but bit that back, too, understanding the futility of it and knowing that her own harsh words wouldn\u0027t cover her hurt. Not this time. She had gone to Wulfgar the previous night, as soon as Arumn closed his doors, which was not long after the fight had scuttled the Cutlass. Delly knew where to find the now homeless man, for Morik kept a room nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow thrilled she had been when Wulfgar had taken her in, despite Morik\u0027s protests. She had let her guard back down again, for Delly had spent the night in Wulfgar\u0027s arms, fantasizing about escaping her miserable life with the heroic man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could run away from Luskan, perhaps, and back to wild Icewind Dale, where she might raise his children as his proper wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the morning-or rather, the early afternoon-had shown her the truth of those fantasies in the form of a grumbling rejection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay on the bed now, feeling empty and alone, helpless and hopeless. Though things between her and Wulfgar had been hurtful of late, the mere fact that the man was still around had allowed her to hold onto her dreams. If Wulfgar wouldn\u0027t be around anymore, Delly would be without any chance of escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you expect anything different?\" came a question from Morik, as if the rogue were reading her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly gave him a sad, sour look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must know by now what to expect from that one,\" Morik reasoned, moving to sit on the bed. Delly started to pull the covers up but remembered that it was just Morik, and he knew well enough what she looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will never give you that which you truly desire,\" Morik added. \"Too many burdens clouding his mind, too many remembered agonies. If he opened up to you as you hope, he\u0027d likely kill you by mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly looked at him as if she didn\u0027t understand. Hardly surprised, Morik merely smiled and said again, \"He\u0027ll not give you that which you truly desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And will Morik then?\" Delly asked with open sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rogue laughed at the thought. \"Hardly,\" he admitted, \"but at least I tell you that openly. Except for my word, I am no honest man and want no honest woman. My life is my own, and I don\u0027t wish to be bothered with a child or a wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds free,\" Morik corrected with a laugh. \"Ah, Delly,\" he said, reaching up to run a hand through her hair. \"You would find life so much more enjoyable if you basked in present joys without fearing for future ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly Curtie leaned back against the headboard, considering the words and showing no practical response against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik took that as a cue and climbed into the bed beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you this part, me squeaky little friend, for your offered coins,\" the rowdy Sheela Kree said, tapping the flat of Aegis-fang\u0027s head. She exploded into a violent movement that brought the warhammer arching over her head to smash down on the center of the table separating her from Josi Puddles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Josi realized with great alarm that there was only empty air between him and the vicious pirate, for the table had collapsed to splinters across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheela Kree smiled wickedly and lifted Aegis-fang. With a squeak Josi sprinted for and through the door, out into the wet, salty night air. He heard the explosion behind him, the hurled hammer connecting solidly against the jamb, heard the howls of laughter from the many cutthroats within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosi didn\u0027t look back. In fact, by the time he stopped running he was leaning against the wall of the Cutlass, wondering how in the Nine Hells he was going to explain the situation to Arumn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still gasping to regain a steady breath when he spotted Delly moving fast down the road, her shawl pulled tight around her. She would not normally be returning to the Cutlass so late, for the place was already brimming with patrons, unless she were on an errand from Arumn. Her hands were empty, except for the folds of the shawl, so Josi had little trouble figuring out where she had gone, or at least who she had gone to visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she neared, the little man heard her sobs, which only confirmed that Delly had gone to see Wulfgar and that the barbarian had ripped her heart open a bit wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are ye all right?\" the man asked, moving out to intercept the woman. Delly jumped in surprise, unaware that Josi had been standing there. \"What pains ye?\" Josi asked softly, moving closer, lifting his hands to pat Delly\u0027s shoulders and thinking that he might use this moment of pain and vulnerability to his own gain, to finally bed the woman about whom he had fantasized for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly, despite her sobs and downcast expression, abruptly pulled away from him. The look she returned was not one of lust, not even of friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hurt ye, Delly,\" Josi remarked quietly and comfortingly. \"He hurt ye, and I can help ye feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly scoffed openly. \"Ye\u0027re the one who set it all up, aren\u0027t ye now, Josi Puddles?\" she accused. \"What a happy sot ye are for chasing Wulfgar away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Josi could begin to answer, the woman brushed past him and disappeared into the Cutlass, a place where Josi could not follow. He stood out in the empty street, in the dark of night, with no place to go and no friends to speak of. He blamed Wulfgar for all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosi Puddles spent that night wandering the alleyways and drinking holes of the toughest parts of Luskan. He spoke not a word to anyone through the dark hours, but instead, listened carefully, always on the alert in these dangerous parts. To his surprise he heard something important and not threatening. It was an interesting story concerning Morik the Rogue and his large barbarian friend, and a hefty contract to eliminate a certain ship\u0027s captain. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-6.html","bookId":2132,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM"}
