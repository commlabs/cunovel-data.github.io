{"id":90974,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e��Thank God!\" a voice shouted in Jenny\u0027s ear. Jenny relaxed against the slim but very strong arms holding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee-you scared me to death... .\" The lights were on the canopy of the merry-go-round across the lake. It was turning and Jenny could hear faint music from a Wurlitzer band organ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared us to death,\" Audrey said. \"Where have you been for the last two hours? We ran down that shaft with the roof caving in right behind us all the way-and then when we finally got to the mouth of the cave, we realized you weren\u0027t with us. Then Dee went crazy and tried to go back while everything was still falling, but it almost killed us and we had to go out-and when we got out, it was just a ride again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The caving-in noise stopped,\" Michael explained, \"and I looked back and the cave was fiberglass again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And empty,\" Dee said, giving Jenny a fierce hug before letting go. \"We walked all through it, the three of us, and you weren\u0027t in it. It was just a mine ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is the Emergency Exit we just came out of,\" Audrey said, pointing a finger at Jenny\u0027s door. \"So the question is, where have you been? You\u0027ve seen him, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was looking down at herself by the light of a nearby fountain-a fountain which had been dark when they\u0027d first gone into the ride. Her jeans were rumpled but dry, her hair was all ridges and waves, the way it got when it dried without her brushing it. The supplies she\u0027d packed so carefully to help her face the Shadow World were gone. Even her flashlight was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw him,\" she told Audrey briefly without looking at her. \"I found out what the new Game is.\" She explained what Julian had told her about finding the three doubloons to get to Zach and Tom. She didn\u0027t say anything about the other Shadow Men, or the rising water in the dark cave, or how it had felt to die. She wanted to; she wanted to talk about it in privacy, and maybe cry, and be comforted, safe with her friends. But she wasn\u0027t safe, and there wasn\u0027t any privacy, and what was the point of alarming everybody?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Julian and his bizarre mood swings-she didn\u0027t even want to get on the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So at least we got something out of that ride,\" Michael said. \"I mean, it nearly killed us, and we lost most of our stuff, but we did get some weapons, and now we know what we\u0027re doing. What happens after we collect these doubloons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we go to the bridge, just like that kid said in the regular park,\" Jenny said. She was grateful-and proud. They were all battered and tired, and there were only two flashlights left-but no one was even talking about giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bridge must be on the other side of the lake, around back,\" she added. \"When we get there, I guess Julian will let us across.\" She looked at the lake. The merry-go-round lights were reflected in it, and so were other lights, blue and green and gold, from the island itself. Shadows of trees broke them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the island, standing very tall and white, was the lighthouse. It looked the same as the one Jenny had seen that afternoon, in the real park, except that now it was illuminated like the Washington Monument. Like a tower for imprisoned princes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where Tom and Zach are,\" she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where should we start looking?\" Dee said, equally quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emergency Exit door had brought Jenny out close to the front of the mine ride. \"Well-we could go left to Kiddieland,\" she said, \"or right, back the way we came from the Fish Pond. Or around the front of the lake, toward the merry-go-round.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael ran a hand through his rumpled dark hair. \"Let\u0027s go around the lake-it\u0027ll take us by the billboard about the contest. Maybe that\u0027ll give us a clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where we came in tonight,\" Audrey said. \"When we came through the door with the runes, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked past the dark ringtoss booth and around the gentle northern curve of the lake. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to which parts of the park were awake and which still slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kept a close eye out for things like the one that had attacked Dee, but they saw nothing. Then, as they got closer to the billboard, Jenny heard a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low voice. It scared her-who else was in the park with them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rounded a clump of spruce trees and saw a car from a circus train, with a red roof and silver bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Leo the Paper-Eating Lion,\" the muzzle thrust between the bars said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the voice-was wrong. It wasn\u0027t the peppy, friendly tenor of the Leo in the regular park. It had dropped two octaves and become distorted and almost machinelike. A thick, muddy cybervoice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez,\" Michael whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny moved cautiously closer, following Dee. The circus car was lighted, very bright and gay against a dark background of bushes. The animal looked like the Leo of the ordinary park, with a shiny caramel-colored face, dark mane, and painted body. Jenny\u0027s eyes were drawn to the muzzle, spread in a permanent smiling O so it could suck up trash. It looked as if it were calling \"Yoohoo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I eat all kinds of things,\" the growling, guttural voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet,\" breathed Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it doing here? Is it just to scare us?\" Audrey said, circling the cart at a safe distance. Dee was playing her flashlight into the olastic muzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there\u0027s something in there,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding. You are kidding, aren\u0027t you?\" Jenny edged along beside Audrey. She didn\u0027t want to get any closer to the lion than she had to-the asphalt path wasn\u0027t nearly wide enough in her opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee knelt and squinted. \"Something gold,\" she said. \"No, really, I\u0027m serious. Look way back in there, in the throat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnhappily Jenny took the flashlight and aimed it at the dark hole. It did look as if there might be something shining inside, but gold or silver, she couldn\u0027t tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might just be a gum wrapper,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee leaned a casual arm on her shoulder. \"Don\u0027t tell me, you\u0027ve had Leo the Lion nightmares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny hadn\u0027t, that she could remember. But the lion had looked sinister even this afternoon, and it looked doubly sinister now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not putting my hand in there,\" Michael said positively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee flashed her most barbaric smile. \"No, Audrey can do it; she\u0027s got nice long nails. How about it, Aud?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tease her,\" Jenny said absently. \"Now, what we need is something long-but a fishing pole wouldn\u0027t work because it wouldn\u0027t catch a coin. Maybe if we put something sticky on the end ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s as good as a hand. Audrey could-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee, quit it!\" Jenny cast a sharp look at the girl beside her. She didn\u0027t know why Dee and Audrey seemed to be having problems today-maybe it was a reaction to all the tension-but this was no time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor Dee\u0027s skewed sense of humor. Audrey was standing a little apart from the others, head tilted back, chestnut eyes narrowed in disdain, cherry-colored lips pursed. She looked very cool and superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leo\u0027s always hungry. So feed me,\" the distorted, bestial voice said. Every time it spoke, Jenny\u0027s heart jumped. She was terrified that the caramel-colored muzzle might move, that she\u0027d look up and Leo\u0027s head would swing toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0027t. It\u0027s plastic, she thought. But she was afraid her heart would simply stop if it did. The quietness of the park around them, the darkness, made this one animated trash can even more eerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee sat back on her heels. \"It looks like there\u0027s more to this than just finding the coins. We have to actually get them, which may be the hardest part. It\u0027s a quest game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quest?\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Remember how I told you about the different kinds of games, once? Games fall into certain categories. The first one Julian played with us, where we had to get to the top of the house by dawn, that was a race game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, and the second one, where the animals were chasing us, was a hunting game. Like hide-and-seek,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, there\u0027s another type of game, where you have to find things in order to win-like in a treasure hunt or a scavenger hunt. Or hot and cold. A quest game. It\u0027s as old as the other kinds of games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" Michael said. \"Humans are terrific questers-they love to look for things. The Holy Grail, or the truth, or the treasures in Zork, or whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely you can find something to feed Leo the Paper-Eating Lion. I\u0027m starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked up, jerked out of the pleasant hypothetical discussion. Audrey was standing by the circus car, examining her nails. The usually perfect polish had been slightly chipped in the mine ride. She looked thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, princess. I dare you,\" Dee said, her black eyes flashing in amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly, Audrey,\" Jenny said automatically. The concept was so ridiculous, though, that she said it unhurriedly. Audrey never did anything reckless-not physically reckless, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Jenny didn\u0027t say the warning with urgency, and therefore she was, in some way, responsible for what happened next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey put her hand in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was the one who shouted. Jenny jumped up. But for a moment it looked as if it was going to be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey, her face set, was fishing around in the hole. Her hand was in it to the wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel something,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s heart was thudding. \"Oh, Audrey...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey\u0027s lips curved in a triumphant smile that brought out her beauty mark. \"It\u0027s cold-I\u0027ve got it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen everything happened very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caramel-colored plastic face was flowing, melting, like a very good morphing effect in a movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a movie it would have been fascinating-but here it was real. It was real, and so awful that it froze Jenny to the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colors bled and changed, going olive green, then a dreadful grayish cemetery tone with steely streaks. The eyes sank, becoming hollow pits. The mouth seemed to snarl, lips pulling back to reveal long teeth that had grown to trap Audrey\u0027s wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened so fast that even Dee didn\u0027t have time to move. Audrey started to gasp, and then screamed instead. Her entire body snapped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing had sucked her arm in to the elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey!\" Michael shouted. He covered the distance to her in two steps. Dee was right behind him with her pick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo good, Jenny thought dazedly. It\u0027s not flesh, like that thing-like Slug. It\u0027s stone or metal or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t hit it, Dee. That won\u0027t help-that won\u0027t help. We have to pull her out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing-it wasn\u0027t a lion anymore, but some sort of hideous cyberbeast-was now the color of an old statue coated with moss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey screamed again, breathlessly, and her body jerked. The nylon jacket was skinned up to her shoulder now, bunched\" like an inner tube as her arm was dragged farther in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s taking my arm off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny gasped, almost sobbing. Michael was yanking at Audrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t pull! Don\u0027t pull! It hurts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaseline, Jenny was thinking. Or soap-something to make it slippery. But they didn\u0027t have anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee!\" she said. \"Use the pick-try to pry its teeth apart. Michael, wait until she gets it in-then pull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey was still screaming and Michael was crying. Vaguely, in shock, Jenny noticed that the stone beast was still changing, becoming more deformed. Dee wedged the tip of the heavy pick upside down between the gray, mossy teeth and pulled back on the handle. Jenny grabbed it to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee threw her weight down. Jenny prayed the wooden handle wouldn\u0027t break off from the iron head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt something shift-the upper jaw lifting just a fraction, like a car lifting on a jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull, Michael!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael pulled. Audrey\u0027s arm came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed on a new note-a shriek that pierced Jenny\u0027s chest. But her arm came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all fell backward, the pick clattering down. With a common impulse they scrabbled back away from the circus car, still sitting, still holding on to one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only then that Jenny looked at Audrey\u0027s arm. ,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were toothmarks. Or-some kind of marks, as if sharp rocks had been scraped over the skin. Long, raw gouges, just starting to bleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey-oh, God, are you okay?\" Michael asked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gurgling, maniacal voice said, \"I bet I\u0027ll have a tummyache tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked. The cyberbeast had stopped changing, its features frozen in a long-toothed snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee raised a clenched fist, tendons cording in her slender arm. Then she dropped it. \"I don\u0027t think it can move toward us,\" she said in a curiously quenched voice. Jenny glanced at her, but Dee turned and Jenny found herself looking at the back of her close-cropped head, where velvety nubs of hair glistened like mica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anybody have aspirin?\" Jenny said. \"I lost mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael, who had taken off his sweatshirt and was trying to wrap Audrey\u0027s arm in his undershirt, thrust a hand in his pocket. \"I\u0027ve got some ... here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey\u0027s left hand was trembling as she took them, washing them down with a gulp of water from the canteen Dee silently offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Jenny asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey took another drink of water. Her spiky lashes were dark against her cheek as she leaned back against Michael. She looked as white as porcelain, and as fragile. But she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? You can move your arm and everything?\" Michael\u0027s cotton undershirt was showing signs of pink, but it wasn\u0027t the cuts that worried Jenny. She was afraid Audrey\u0027s shoulder might be dislocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey nodded again. A faint smile appeared on her lips. She lifted her right arm, the bandaged one, and turned it over. Then, slowly, she unclenched her fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael gave a shout of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it! You wouldn\u0027t let go, you little-\" He seized Audrey in a bear hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may kiss me,\" Audrey said. \"Just don\u0027t squish my arm.\" She twisted her head toward Dee. \"Good thing your pick wasn\u0027t flimsy. No rawhide there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an extraordinarily generous gesture, but Dee seemed to take it as an insult. At least, when Jenny looked at Dee, she could only see the fine curve of a dark cheekbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If everybody can move, we\u0027d better go,\" Dee said. \"We\u0027re right in the open here; anything could be sneaking up on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny helped Audrey up as Michael put his sweatshirt back on. The lion-thing in the painted cage watched them like a gargoyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should we do with the coin?\" Audrey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take it.\" Jenny put this one in the pocket of her pale blue denim shirt and buttoned the pocket. \"If we can get to the merry-go-round, we can rest. There\u0027s an arbor thing beside it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe merry-go-round had gone dark, but across the shimmering water of the lake Jenny could see the shining lighthouse. Tom was there-and Zach. Jenny had to get to them, no matter what happened on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey didn\u0027t want to rest long. \"If I don\u0027t get up now, I never will. But where do we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That lion was lit-up-working,\" Michael said. \"And it had a doubloon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we just look for something else that\u0027s working?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the idea of being led,\" Dee said, but she said it without her usual confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was worried about Dee. Of course she hadn\u0027t meant for anybody to get hurt. She\u0027d just been trying to get a rise out of Audrey. But the way it had turned out-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those lights way down there?\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the merry-go-round, beyond a stretch of greenery, tiny white lights twinkled between dark trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think-I think it may be the arcade,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s working,\" said Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Auons-y,\" Audrey said, settling things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed the dark merry-go-round and a rocket ride with all the rockets landed, down. As they rounded a slight turn in the path, a building came into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of tiny white lights flashed, running along the borders of a sign reading: penny arcade. Jenny stopped in her tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-it\u0027s different. It\u0027s not like it was this afternoon. It\u0027s like-\" Suddenly she knew. \"It\u0027s like it used to be. This is the way the arcade looked when I was a kid. I remember!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s open,\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors gaped invitingly. Jenny felt a qualm as they cautiously stepped over the threshold. She didn\u0027t know why Julian had made the arcade this way, but she couldn\u0027t imagine it meant anything good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it gave her a strange pang of pleasure to see what was inside the building. Not the gleaming, spotless, high-tech wonderland she\u0027d seen in the real park that day. Now it was a dim, rather dingy room, crowded with old-fashioned wooden cabinets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomata, Jenny remembered. That\u0027s what her grandfather had called the machines with moving figures inside them. She remembered him taking her here, putting dimes in the slots, watching the mechanical action scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandfather had always seemed to have time for her. All she knew as a kid was that he was a professor of this, that, and the other, but he never seemed to go to work anywhere. He was always home when Jenny and Zach came to visit-unless he was traveling. He did a lot of traveling, and always brought back presents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that? There-at the back,\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked, but only saw more cabinets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone now. I thought it was one of those little critters-the scuttling ones.\" He spotted something. \"Hey, you want some candy peanuts? I found lots of change in with the aspirin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machine dispensed black candy-coated peanuts, very stale, and square multicolored gum. Jenny felt a little better while chewing it, comforted somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the machines were interesting, in the absurd, picturesque way of times gone by. There were peep shows and nickelodeons and all sorts of mechanized figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Ole Barn Dance,\" Jenny read on one cabinet. \"See \u0027em Whoop It Up! Watch \u0027em Swing! Drop two bits in the box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little figures were made of blocks of wood, dangling from wires. Their wooden jaws hung open grotesquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think we should try the things?\" Audrey said doubtfully. Jenny knew what she meant-after what had happened with Leo, she didn\u0027t relish the thought of activating anything mechanical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we have to,\" she said slowly. \"In case the coin\u0027s inside one of them. Just stay back from them-and if anything goes on by itself, run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And check the coin slots,\" Audrey said sensibly. \"What better place to hide a doubloon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved carefully around the dim room, staying together, checking the tops and bottoms of cabinets for a gleam of gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael found a mutoscope and began cranking it, leaning gingerly to look in the goggle-type viewer and watch the flip-card film, see naughty marietta sun bathing, the sign on the brass-trimmed machine read, passed by my censors, oct. 1897.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My arm hurts,\" he said afterward. \"And it\u0027s just some lady wrapped in a sheet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey paused in front of an elaborately carved machine with gold paint that was much faded and rubbed off. Dee found a cabinet that looked like a grandfather clock, labeled: see horrible monster. terrifying-shocking-only 5 cents. Jenny knew that machine: You put your money in and saw a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny ventured a little farther down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that grip tester-she didn\u0027t want to touch it. She didn\u0027t want to step on the foot vitalizer, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere-a rather shabby wood box with dark glass. The sign read: ask the wizard, deposit it in slot and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE WIZARD WILL PERFORM FOR YOU. Below Was a Strip of plastic tape: receive prediction here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had always liked the kind of fortune-teller that gave you a card. She loved the outrageous predictions about whether you were going to get married and what your career would be. She picked out a dime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coin slot was shaped like a sphinx. Jenny hesitated an instant with the dime resting against cool metal. A flash of foreboding went through her, as if telling her to stop and think before she did anything rash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was rash about turning on a mechanized wizard? And they had to search this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped the dime in. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-kill-the-forbidden-game-3/page-8.html","bookId":2101,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:09 PM"}
