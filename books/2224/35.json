I wanted her to have as much information as she needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJillian sighed and rose from her chair. She walked slowly around the desk, picked up a long blue pen, and began twirling it slowly with the thumb and fingers of her right hand. She sat on the corner of the desk, just inches from where I was sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, McKenzie. Didn’t you once tell me that I couldn’t hypnotize you? That I couldn’t hypnotize anyone who resists?

Remember it out loud. Start with Frank Crosetti pointing a shotgun at you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was frightened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard a car. A man is driving a car up the driveway. He is driving very fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you see the car clearly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Describe the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a Ford Mustang convertible. 2002 or 2003.

She had written the license plate number of the yellow Mustang on a sheet of her stationery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I’m sorry, Jill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “Get out of my office, McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cities—New York and New Orleans come to mind—a sizable percentage of civil servants figure they earn their paychecks just by showing up in the morning. Actually doing work, that costs extra. And if you expect service with a smile, forgetaboutit. But in Minnesota, there is no culture of baksheesh. Most government employees here are happy to assist you. Some will actually go beyond their job descriptions to be helpful and will ask for nothing in return except a simple thank-you, and even that’s not required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake the woman at Minnesota Driver and Vehicles Services in the Town Square Building in downtown St. Paul, for example. She seemed delighted to furnish me with both a Record Request form and the requisite Intended Use of Driver License and Motor Vehicle Information form. She even helped me massage the language I used to complete the section labeled “Explain How You Intend to Use Record Information”—“Owner of vehicle with above license plate number caused damage to rental car; requester would like information to present to rental car company.” When time came to pay for the service, she said, “I’m sorry,” before requesting the $4.50 fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn return, she gave me the name Penelope Joan Glass, 839 47th Avenue, Hilltop, Minnesota, as well as Penelope’s vital statistics—height 5’ 8”, weight 125, eyes blue, hair blonde—and her phone number, date of birth, vehicle identification number, and driver’s license number. I could’ve requested Penelope’s driving record, too, but that cost extra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a flush of accomplishment as I wrote down the information in my notebook. I was doing some real detecting and it felt good, like the tingle you get when you exercise seldom-used muscles. But I was left with a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where in hell is Hilltop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid I don’t know,” the woman said. “I have a map you can borrow …” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-35.html","bookId":2224,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM"}
