{"id":110301,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"More Timbits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head for the third time. If I\u0027d learned anything about the Satanists-excuse me, the Army of Darkness-in my breakfast meeting with them two days later, it was that they really liked donuts. A lot. They kept trying to force food on me and seemed particularly fond of the aforementioned Timbits, which were like donut holes except with a cuter name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the donuts, a large part of the meeting focused on me. They all wanted to know who I was, where I\u0027d come from, how my own group operated, etc. I spun lies out as fast as I could, rapidly building up a backstory for my Seattle Satanist group. The Army listened eagerly, and I hoped I\u0027d be able to remember everything I was saying if quizzed afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll just have to come visit us sometime,\" I said, hoping to allay the questions. \"That\u0027s the only way you\u0027ll really understand. For now, I mean, Kristin wanted me to come here to talk about you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mention of Kristin sobered them up. Evan nodded. \"Georgina thinks we maybe need to expand our activities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were six total gathered here, the truly \"active\" members. They ranged from 20s to 40s in age, and like Evan, they had that same sort of pleasant demeanor that was more suited to helping you pick out a DVD player or lawn mower than sacrifice a goat. Maybe it was just a Canadian thing. One of the members, a tiny blond college student named Allison, frowned. \"But why? We\u0027re already doing what the Angel wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at me, and I saw conflict on their faces. I\u0027d slept with a man far more moral than Dante last night and was in the full throes of succubus charisma. I could tell it affected them. It was part of why they were so intrigued by me, and it would give me leverage here. Yet, I also realized, no matter how powerful they thought Kristin was and no matter how much they respected her endorsement of me, I was still an outsider and not necessarily to be trusted, appealing or not. Again, I marveled at the strength of their conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t want you guys to stop...\" That was, of course, exactly what I wanted. \"But most of what you\u0027re doing is scaring people.\" That wasn\u0027t exactly true, but how else could I describe it? \"It seems like now that you\u0027ve established yourselves, you should use that strength to start influencing people toward the Angel\u0027s will. Surely you\u0027ll best do his- her bidding by actually leading people into darkness.\" I made eye contact with each person as I spoke, smiling and putting as much coaxing charm as I could into my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy with a shaved head, whose name I\u0027d forgotten, popped a chocolate glazed Timbit into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully. \"That makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison didn\u0027t agree. \"If that\u0027s what the Angel wanted us to do, we would know. Right now, we need to keep doing just as we have. We are getting strong, and we need to make sure that strength doesn\u0027t wane in the face of our enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to keep smiling. These people didn\u0027t understand anything, let alone their so-called enemies. I turned toward Evan and looked at him through lowered lashes. \"Why settle for one goal, though? Evan, I thought you of all people really wanted to make this group great. I thought you wanted to bring more souls to the Angel\u0027s side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we\u0027re already doing,\" argued Allison. She didn\u0027t seem to like me using the come-hither eyes on Evan. For his part, Evan didn\u0027t like being caught between us. He started to stammer out something but was interrupted by the shaved-head guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" he asked Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"What do you mean, Blake? How what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are we bringing more souls to the Angel\u0027s side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By striking out at those who deny her greatness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...\" Blake frowned and finished eating another Timbit. \"But I don\u0027t think doing that is bringing more souls to our side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you questioning what we\u0027ve done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I stand by it all. It\u0027s just...\" Blake shrugged. \"It seems like the things we\u0027re doing aren\u0027t really swaying souls toward the Angel. If anything, it\u0027s just making them take a harder stand against us.\" Finally! Finally someone got it. I could have kissed Blake. Maybe I would later. \"I mean, I\u0027m not really sure the Zamboni plan is really going to darken souls. It\u0027ll just make people want to defend themselves against us. Maybe it\u0027s time to do the Angel\u0027s will through more subtle means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I cried. \"That\u0027s exactly what I-Zamboni?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith much enthusiasm, they explained an idea they\u0027d come up with to spray-paint a Zamboni with Satanic messages right before it came out on the ice during a hockey game. Still keeping that idiotic smile on my face, I said in a level voice, \"I think maybe you should reconsider that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebate went on for the next hour or so. I was a bit dismayed that I hadn\u0027t swayed them all to my point of view immediately, but I\u0027d sent enough ripples through them to make a difference. No matter what they claimed, none of them were really sure what exactly the Angel did want, of course, and while some were comfortable in their rut, others were starting to grasp my logic. I took it as a great sign of victory that when we finally got up to go, they\u0027d decided against taking any action-say, like, the Zamboni plan-until they\u0027d met again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked out of the restaurant, I caught up with Blake. I\u0027d decided Evan was a lost cause. Blake seemed to be the smartest of the group, and I thought it might be time for a leadership change. With a little help, it wouldn\u0027t take much to topple Evan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, beaming at Blake. \"I really liked what you had to say. Are you busy right now? Maybe we could talk some more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled back at me, genuinely interested. I probably wouldn\u0027t have even needed any succubus glamour to convince him. \"I wish I could...but I have to go to work. Are you free later tonight? Like after dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" We swapped numbers, and as we were about to part, I asked in a low voice, \"You don\u0027t think they\u0027ll do something anyway, do you? Despite what they said about...you know, putting the Zamboni plan on hold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin broadened. \"No, they won\u0027t do the Zamboni plan. I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re out of spray paint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027ll get more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Not without me. I\u0027m their supplier. I work at Home Depot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI again found myself with time to kill in Vancouver. It was a beautiful day, and the temperature was unseasonably warm for April. So, I went and walked along the waterfront. The water seemed bluer than our own Puget Sound back in Seattle, but maybe that was just because the weather tended to be sunnier here. I wandered through Stanley Park afterward and then finally meandered back to my hotel. As I did, I again passed one of the T-shirt shops. They\u0027d changed their display and now showed a shirt with a U.S. map on it that read: Dear Canada, Please Invade .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in my room, I booted up my laptop to check my e-mail. There were a few from the bookstore\u0027s mailing list that I ignored, as well as the usual spam. Along with those messages, I had one from greygoose. com\u0027s mailing list, a picture of a cat with some nonsensical caption that Cody had forwarded me, and a letter from Maddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mass e-mail she\u0027d sent out this morning. It read: Hey, guys! I decided to start a blog. Check it out. A link followed. Even though every instinct told me not to, I clicked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould have listened to those instincts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePictures of her and Seth bombarded me. They\u0027d gone to the Seattle Aquarium last night and taken assorted photos posing by puffins, squids, and other sea creatures. Worse, Seth\u0027s nieces were with them. That nearly killed me. Seth had five adorable blond nieces, ranging from four to fourteen. I loved them to pieces, and breaking up with him had been like breaking up with them too. The girls all looked reasonably happy, and I wondered if they even remembered me. Well, of course they did. It hadn\u0027t been that long. But I knew I\u0027d keep fading from their minds until eventually, I was just some vague memory of their uncle\u0027s ex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut down the laptop and decided to head down to the hotel\u0027s bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t quite dinnertime, so the place was fairly deserted. I took a seat at the bar near the television and promptly made friends with the bartender. Three gimlets later, I\u0027d also made friends with an older couple visiting from San Francisco and some businessmen in town from Winnipeg. We were laughing about a recent movie when the TV suddenly changed from a curling match to static. The bartender pushed buttons on the remote ineffectually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, the picture returned, but this time it was on a different channel, one showing a local news program. My smile faded, and my stomach sank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera crew was reporting from Queen Elizabeth Park, another gorgeous area in the city that I\u0027d briefly considered going to after Stanley Park. I wondered if I might have seen this atrocity and been able to stop it if I had visited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Army of Darkness had staged a demonstration there late that afternoon. I counted about ten of them, so they must have recruited some of their auxiliary members. They were clothed in robes and hoods made out of cheap black and purple velvet, but I recognized two figures that looked suspiciously like Evan and Allison. Some of them held signs with pentagrams and assorted \"evil\" slogans while they walked around chanting something I couldn\u0027t make out. One of them had stuck a pole in the ground with a giant rubber goat mask on top of it. The mask wasn\u0027t affixed very well and kind of hung off to the side, making it look more like a mutant goat than an emblem of Hell. The footage showed a crowd gathered around and, later, police coming to break everything up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly charged the drinks to my room and sprinted off, pulling out my cell phone as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blake? This is Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. \"I know, I know. I just found out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell happened? They said they weren\u0027t going to do anything. You said they weren\u0027t going to do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think they would!\" He sounded sincerely upset. \"I was at work until about a half-hour ago. I had no idea-honest. They did it on their own. I guess a bunch of them got arrested. Evan, Joy, and Crystal made it out, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and canceled our plans for tonight. I had to do damage control before Cedric or one of his associates came after me-and I knew for a fact they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove over to Evan\u0027s house. He answered the door, still wearing the robe but not the hood. His face was radiant and excited. \"Georgina! Did you see the news? Did you see what we did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" I pushed him back inside, closing the door behind me before any of the neighbors could see him. \"What happened? You said you wouldn\u0027t do anything else until we met again! What happened to influencing people for the greater goo-evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally caught on that I didn\u0027t share his excitement. \"You don\u0027t think we influenced people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you influenced some people to think you were freaks. A bunch of churches are probably going to have sermons tomorrow about staying pure and true or something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan flounced onto his couch, speculative but still glowing with the rush of their stunt. \"No, this was powerful. Its effects will be far reaching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar reaching enough to get me smote, no doubt. \"What happened? What made you decide to do it? Had you been planning it all along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It was just decided-a couple of hours after we met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" I asked, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the Angel told us to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said you wouldn\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me like I was crazy. \"But the Angel told us to. We had to obey her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to argue the idiocy of that and then paused to reconsider something I hadn\u0027t given credence to before. \"Are you saying the Angel actually spoke to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. How else would we know what she wants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uneasy feeling came over me. This whole time, when they\u0027d spoken of doing what the Angel \"wanted,\" I\u0027d assumed it was in the way so many religious zealots presumed they understood their deity\u0027s desires. Those who said their deity spoke to them were usually crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she, like, speak to you in dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"She appeared to me. Right here. Well, over there, actually. By the TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Angel appears to you,\" I said flatly. \"In the flesh. Shows up and tells you what to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. How else do you think we\u0027d know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat uneasy feeling increased. \"What does she look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan sighed, a dreamy expression filling his features. \"Oh, Georgina. She\u0027s beautiful. So beautiful. She glows-she\u0027s almost hard to look at. Her hair-it\u0027s like a cloak of gold, and her eyes...\" He sighed again. \"I can\u0027t describe them. Like all the colors in the rainbow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rang just then, interrupting his similes. I didn\u0027t recognize the number, but it was a Vancouver area code. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Cedric. \"If you are not in my office in ten minutes,\" he said. \"I will come and bring you here. And you won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved my phone into my purse and stood up. \"Evan, I\u0027ve gotta run. Look, if the Angel talks to you again, can you give me a heads up next time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned hesitant. \"Um, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused at the door. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you see...Don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but she told us not to tell you. She said to keep this to the inner circle. Probably she just needs to get to know you better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sent my mind reeling, but Cedric\u0027s words had a greater impact at the moment. I had no time to argue against an entity that might or might not be real. \"We\u0027ll talk about this later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sped over to the Financial District, not bothering to count the minutes for fear of what I\u0027d find. Nothing happened to me by the time I reached Cedric\u0027s office, so I assumed I\u0027d made it. Kristin wasn\u0027t in the reception area, but his door was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in here,\" Cedric barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pounding, I walked into his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was filled with rage, and if I\u0027d had any thoughts that his mild manner made him seem undemonlike, that idea was immediately banished. He clenched his fists as he glared at me, and I thanked whatever luck I had that he had remained sitting and didn\u0027t throw me across the room. Meekly, I slid into my usual chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" he demanded. \"Or rather, what aren\u0027t you doing?\" He pointed to his computer screen. It didn\u0027t have Wikipedia on it for a change. Instead, it showed pictures of the demonstration for a local paper\u0027s website. \"You were supposed to stop this kind of thing! Did Jerome send you here to sabotage me and spy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! They did this without telling me. I\u0027d actually convinced them this morning not to do this other thing with a Zamboni, and then they went behind my back because their Angel of Darkness allegedly spoke to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs quickly as I could, I recapped the day\u0027s events and conversation. When I finished, his glower hadn\u0027t changed. He still clearly didn\u0027t believe me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome said you were good, but I had no idea you were this good. You manipulated this group right under my nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I repeated. \"I\u0027ll swear to you by whatever you want. I tried to stop them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued as though I hadn\u0027t spoken. \"I am going to get shit for this from everyone. Our own people are going to come down on me-in addition to making me a laughingstock. And eventually, the other side is going to raise an eyebrow too. They don\u0027t like this kind of overt attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other side. Heaven. The angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngels...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s your counterpart here?\" I asked. \"Among the angels. There must be an archangel here too, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question caught him off-guard enough that his pissed-off look momentarily lifted. \"Of course. Her name\u0027s Isabelle. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...Evan and the others keep saying they\u0027re directed by an angel. All this time you thought they were just worshipping some all-purpose Satanic ideal. But what if a real angel is controlling them? I mean, Jerome\u0027s given up the fight with you. If anyone had reason to give you shit, it wouldn\u0027t be our side. It\u0027d be theirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCedric was silent for several moments. \"This isn\u0027t their style. It\u0027s not Isabelle\u0027s either. I\u0027ve known her for a long time.\" When greater immortals said \"a long time,\" they usually weren\u0027t kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she blond?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but that doesn\u0027t mean anything. We can look like anything we want. Someone appearing to this group-and I don\u0027t think anyone is-could easily make themselves blond or bald or whatever. I think you\u0027re trying to shift the blame off yourself and Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not! Look, I don\u0027t want to get mired in any of this. I just want to finish my job and go home. And if you ask me, I think someone\u0027s trying to work you over and send you looking in the wrong places.\" Good Lord. I sounded like everyone else now. Soon I\u0027d be telling him he was \"getting played.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isabelle wouldn\u0027t do it,\" he maintained. \"We\u0027re friends...well, kind of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was funny that demons lied and betrayed each other all the time, yet he somehow stood by the character of someone who was technically his enemy. I understood it, though. Jerome maintained a similarly bizarre friendship with Seattle\u0027s archangel, Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you get me in touch with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCedric regarded me in amazement. \"You\u0027re really going to run with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sabotaging you-but I want to find out who is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a lot of work just to take the attention off yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI simply looked at him, maintaining as determined a look as I could in the hopes that he\u0027d believed me. I also hoped the taboo demons maintained about messing with the employees of other demons would hold. Apparently it did because he said at last, \"I\u0027ll show you how to contact her, as pointless as that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled the breath I\u0027d been holding. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"But don\u0027t think you\u0027re in the clear. I\u0027m still going to be watching you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-7.html","bookId":2057,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM"}
