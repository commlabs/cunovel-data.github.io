Thus far, Brenna was winning their wager, as neither brother had said a word about her injury.

The little girl didn\u0027t seem to be bothered by all the attention she was getting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled for her papa\u0027s benefit and continued to stare at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, would you like to answer Alec\u0027s question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not deny my brother,\" Connor explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She just did deny him,\" Jamie remarked before she laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna believed Jamie\u0027s behavior was a direct violation of the rules they\u0027d established because she was deliberately tempting the men\u0027s curiosity with her laughter. She wasn\u0027t about to let her get away with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie, I believe you should go to the kitchens and thank Elyne for this meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I leave, you\u0027re coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither one of you needs to get up,\" Connor interjected. \"Elyne and two other servants are watching us from the back hallway. You can give them your praise from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you try to control yourself?\" Alec demanded when his wife was overcome with laughter again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna bounded to her feet. \"Thank you for this fine meal. Will you excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t wait to gain permission. Jamie jumped to her feet next and hurried after Brenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor heard his wife accuse Jamie of cheating and almost dropped his goblet. He hoped to God Alec hadn\u0027t heard the comment. Then, when Brenna stopped in front of the hearth to make the sign of the cross before continuing, Alec was so appalled he knocked his empty goblet over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie found Brenna\u0027s show of respect hilarious. Her laughter followed her out the front doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec waited until the servants had skirted their way past the table and had hurried after their mistress before turning to Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We really should be offended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we should.

Connor winked at her as she passed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec swept her up into his arms, kissed her brow, and sat her down on the edge of the table. He then ordered her to tell him what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lady yelled at Mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Brenna, Grace.

Neither did the child\u0027s attempt to wiggle out of her father\u0027s arms. \"Answer me, Grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had to catch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec could picture in his mind exactly what had happened. Connor was at a disadvantage because he\u0027d left Alec\u0027s household long before Grace was born and, therefore, didn\u0027t know about the child\u0027s history of mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t understand how Brenna could have lost her footing,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace, tell your uncle how she caught you,\" her father instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl was thrilled to have both her father\u0027s and her uncle\u0027s attention. She put her feet down on his lap, stretched her arms up above her head, and tried to leap up in the air in an attempt to reenact the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec held on to his daughter and gently forced her to sit back down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to be the death of me, Grace,\" he muttered with a shake of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Papa. You already told me before. Lots of times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be the death of your dear wife too, Laird,\" the cook remarked as she hurried back toward the kitchens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec turned to the older woman. \"My daughter catapulted herself off that top step, didn\u0027t she, Elyne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see it happen, Laird, but my mistress did tell me Grace came flying down the stairs, and with as much speed as a stone hurling down from the top of a tower. Lady Brenna had to jump up so she could catch her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They both could have broken their necks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, they could have, Connor,\" Alec agreed before turning back to the loyal servant. \"Explain why our wives don\u0027t want us to know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyne couldn\u0027t refuse her laird\u0027s command and quickly told him about the wagering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brothers weren\u0027t at all amused by their wives\u0027 bet. They were, however, willing to go along with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie and Brenna joined them a few minutes later. Both husbands stood up when the ladies entered the hall, but after being ignored for several minutes, they sat back down. Alec poured wine into their goblets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe downed his drink in one long swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna had already gained Alec\u0027s loyalty as soon as she married his brother. She received his devotion the minute he found out she\u0027d saved his precious daughter from a serious injury, and she won his admiration and love when he heard her tell Jamie she must immediately remove the tapestry. Jamie vehemently refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then at least remove the yellow threads of the halo as soon as possible. You cannot saint William the Conqueror just because you think he should be a saint. It\u0027s a sacrilege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"William will be a saint just as soon as the church gets around to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna shook her head. \"No wonder your husband looked like he was staring at the devil. Why in heaven\u0027s name would you hang the former king of England in the home of a Highlander? Even I know he doesn\u0027t belong here. You must take it down, Jamie. Good Lord, I\u0027ve been making the sign of the cross every time I pass in front of him, and if that isn\u0027t a blasphemy, I don\u0027t know what is. Are there any of your kings you could hang?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because you\u0027re a Highlander, that\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know, do you? Brenna, I was born in England, raised there too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, she took the wind out of Brenna\u0027s argument with her startling revelation. Jamie laughed over the upset she\u0027d just given her new sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like a Highlander, and no one told me you were…\" Brenna paused to glare at her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t suppose Connor would tell you. You might as well accept the fact that men never tell their wives anything without prodding, Brenna. My news should please you, though, not anger you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna finally managed to stop frowning at her husband. \"I am pleased. No wonder I like you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll like Mary too. Alec, do you realize how blessed I am? I have a sister on each side of my land now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, you do,\" Alec agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor, Brenna must meet Mary as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could we stop on our way home?\" Brenna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too late to make another stop,\" Connor answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined not to let him dampen her enthusiasm, she hurried over to the table and put her hand on his shoulder. \"Another time then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted him to let him know how much she appreciated his cooperation. Alec turned as he stood up so Brenna wouldn\u0027t see him smile. He was pleased to see she was affectionate toward his brother, but what made him smile was the fact that he knew Connor was trying not to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor shook his head at his brother. \"Don\u0027t make more of this than it is,\" he remarked as he reached around his back to move his wife so he wouldn\u0027t knock her over when he stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec nodded. \"I would suggest you not make less of this than it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna didn\u0027t have any idea what the two men were talking about. Alec abruptly changed the subject before she asked him to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d best keep a close lookout on your way home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor always has his guard up,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is so,\" Alec agreed before issuing a second warning to his brother. \"He could be waiting on your land even now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Alec, you do give me hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your arrogance is going to get you killed. We both know he\u0027ll want her back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna suddenly realized who the brothers were talking about. She let out a gasp, grabbed hold of Connor\u0027s arm, and whispered, \"The pig MacNare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband smiled. God love her, she was beginning to realize how fortunate she was to have married him. \"Yes, the pig MacNare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned into his side so she couldn\u0027t be overheard. \"Give me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile vanished. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brisk nod told her she\u0027d made the right guess. He put his arms around her shoulders and squeezed her to let her know he approved of her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to hide her exasperation. It was difficult, given the fact that her husband was now trying to defend her behavior to his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife meant no offense to me. She\u0027s English, if you\u0027ll remember, and therefore doesn\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What don\u0027t I understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec answered her. \"We keep what belongs to us, and we protect our wives. You don\u0027t understand your worth yet, do you, Brenna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she doesn\u0027t,\" Connor answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Englishmen also protect what belongs to them.\" She told them what should have been obvious. \"The barons are just as possessive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you here, lass?\" Alec asked. \"Did your father protect you by sending you to marry MacNare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One has nothing to do with the other, Laird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it different?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth brothers would think her father had been motivated by greed if she explained his reason, and she knew she would never be able to convince them her dear father loved his daughters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here because I wish to be here. When I asked my husband if he would give me back, I only wanted to hear his assurance. I already knew he wouldn\u0027t,\" she boasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you received the church\u0027s approval with the priest\u0027s blessing?\" Alec asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already nodding when she told him no. \"Connor would have gotten around to getting a priest to bless us. Many marriages begin without a blessing because there are so few confessors available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor knew she was struggling to be diplomatic, and he smiled. She was about to lose her patience now, and from the way Alec was questioning her, Connor knew Alec was curious to see what she would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec was enjoying himself, and with each of her frowns and hesitant answers, he was actually finding out far more about her than she could possibly realize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how did you know Connor wouldn\u0027t give you back?\" Alec persisted. \"Did you understand him so well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t understand him at all. I had, of course, noticed how stubborn he was,\" she added when she remembered how she\u0027d argued with Connor to get him to change his mind, and how he\u0027d refused to listen to a word she said. \"However, my parents taught all of their children to stand on their own two feet. My family, you see…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor interrupted her. \"We are your family now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but my sisters and brothers…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe once again interrupted her. \"Jamie and Alec are your sister and brother now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Raen,\" Alec interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor nodded. \"Yes, Raen,\" he agreed. \"It\u0027s been such a long time since I last saw him, I sometimes forget about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor, why don\u0027t you let me talk about my family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re your family now,\" he gently corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec understood exactly what his brother was doing and fully supported him. Connor wanted to help his wife become loyal to him and his followers, of course, and let go of the past, and though Alec thought Connor wasn\u0027t as subtle as he had been when he\u0027d helped Jamie get over her homesickness, he couldn\u0027t fault his brother. \u0027Twas the truth, Connor still wasn\u0027t capable of being subtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisheartened to realize her husband was trying to make her pretend her family didn\u0027t matter, she decided to go outside and ignore him for a few minutes and try to figure out his reason for being so cruel. She was going to have to remove Connor\u0027s arm from around her shoulders first, of course, but when she tried to do just that, she realized she was holding the Kincaid plaid she\u0027d folded and kept on her lap through supper. She tucked the blanket under her arm with the intention of putting it down on one of the stools as soon as Connor let go of her, and then reached up to nudge him away from her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-22.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM"}
