I wondered if you were still at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA momentary panic attacked her. “Am I supposed to be somewhere?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug chuckled. “I thought you said you were going for a walk this afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was something recommended by one of the books they’d read. As a result, Carol had decided she should exercise more, and now that she was home during the day she had plenty of opportunity to spend time outside. This was all part of the program they’d discussed and agreed upon before she’d left her job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. I was just getting ready to head out.” She eyed the microwave and turned her back on her waiting lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carol? Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband recognized her mood, her depression and anxiety. Doug had been right to suggest she quit work. They were both frightened, since there was a very real possibility that she might never carry a pregnancy full-term. It didn’t help that they had one last shot with in vitro fertilization. The insurance company where Doug worked had its headquarters in Illinois, where state law mandated that company health coverage could pay for three attempts; their first two had failed. IVF was the very end of the technological line, the ultimate procedure the fertility clinic had to offer in the quest for a biological child. July would be their last attempt, and after that they were on their own financially. At the start they’d agreed to limit in vitro to the three attempts. If she wasn’t pregnant by then, they’d begin the adoption process. In retrospect, it had been a wise decision. The emotional devastation of the two failures proved she couldn’t endure this process indefinitely. Twice a fertilized egg had been implanted and twice she’d miscarried. No couple should repeatedly face this kind of heartache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol and Doug never mentioned that this third IVF attempt was the end of their hopes, but the fact loomed in their minds. It was vitally important that she get pregnant—and stay pregnant—this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol was willing to give it everything she had. Willing to forsake the job she loved, willing to be poked and prodded and humiliated. She was willing to withstand all the doubts, confront the emotional highs and lows of their attempts at conception, all for the sake of a baby. Doug’s baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Although she said it flippantly, Carol did know. Doug had been with her through this entire process, through the doctors’ visits, the testing, through the tears, the frustration, the anger and the grief. “One day you’ll hold our child in your arms and we’ll both know that everything was worth it.” They’d already chosen the names. Cameron for a boy and Colleen for a girl. She could clearly see their child, could feel the baby in her arms, and see the joy in her husband’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol held on to that dream, and the image of a baby in her arms helped her endure the most difficult aspects of the IVF process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time will you be home?” It had never concerned her before, but now she regulated her life by her husband’s comings and goings. His routine shaped her own, and his return from the office was the highlight of her day. Several times each afternoon she checked her watch, calculating how many hours and then minutes until Doug was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Usual time,” he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband of seven years worked as an insurance underwriter. Carol was the one who earned the big bucks in the family. It was her income that had enabled them to make a substantial down payment on the condo. When they got married, her wise and frugal husband had insisted they adjust their lifestyle to live on his income alone. He feared that otherwise they’d come to rely on her salary and defer having a family. They’d waited three years after marrying, not expecting problems, building up their savings. It was a good thing because even with insurance, the cost of infertility treatments was staggering. And now that she wasn’t working…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have I mentioned how dreadful daytime television is?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn off the TV and go for your walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” she replied in military fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug laughed. “I’m not that bad, am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It’s just that staying home isn’t anything like I thought.” Life at home wasn’t supposed to be endless hours of boredom, desperately searching for ways to amuse herself until Doug came home. She was used to frequent meetings, adrenaline-fuelled decisions, constant busyness. Being at home alone was a new experience and not one she enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me to check in with you later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’ll be fine. You’re right, I do need to get outside and it’s a lovely afternoon.” No place on earth was more beautiful than Seattle when the sun was shining. It was a perfect May day and she gazed out at the snow-topped Olympic Mountains in the distance, the blue-green waters of Puget Sound below her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you around five-thirty,” Doug said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be here.” Before Carol had left the brokerage firm, it was Doug who’d arrived home first. Doug who started dinner. Doug who had the local news blaring from the television. Carol didn’t have any trouble adjusting to this role reversal of a role reversal. Right now, it was one of the few interesting things in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe deposited her lunch in the refrigerator and grabbed an apple on her way out the door. They’d lived in the condo four years, and she still didn’t know her neighbors. They were upwardly mobile types just like her and Doug, with both husband and wife working long hours. Only a few had children and the little ones were rushed off to ultra-expensive day-care centers early in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol rode an empty elevator down to the condo foyer and headed out the double glass doors onto the downtown sidewalk. Munching on her apple as she walked swiftly toward the waterfront, she realized that one fear, at any rate, hadn’t come to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the women in the office had given her dire warnings when they learned she was leaving. The word was that stay-at-home wives and mothers battled constantly with their weight. Being in the kitchen and continually around food made it impossible to maintain a slim waistline, according to her former colleagues. That wasn’t a problem for Carol. Never in her life had she eaten more healthfully. Diet was all part of her new regime and she’d maintained her size 8 figure without difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cool breeze blew off the water as she strolled along her usual route. Then on a whim she headed east, climbing toward Pill Hill, where Virginia Mason Hospital and Swedish Hospital were situated. She was breathing hard as she made it up the steep incline and continued slowly for several blocks, looking around at the unfamiliar neighborhood, until she came to Blossom Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA number of buildings were being renovated. The street was blocked off, but the sidewalk was accessible. The work on one side of the street seemed to be completed, with freshly painted storefronts and a green-and-white awning over the florist’s shop. Tulips and lilies were arranged in buckets outside the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the clang and racket of construction, Carol ventured down the street. A video store and a depressing brick apartment building sat at the far end of the block and a restaurant called Annie’s Café was across the street. The contrast between the old and the new was striking. The unrenovated portion of the street resembled a quaint small town with friendly merchants straight out of a 1960s television series. Granted, some of the buildings were a bit shabby, but they seemed welcoming nonetheless. It was hard to tell that Blossom Street was less than a mile from the heart of downtown Seattle with its high-rises and congested streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to the florist was another surprise: a yarn store. The shop was new, judging by the computer-lettered “Grand Opening” sign. A woman, probably close to her own age, sat in a rocking chair inside, her hands busy with a pair of needles. A large ball of lime-green yarn rested on her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she had nothing better to do, Carol walked through the door, setting off a pleasant chime. “Hello,” she said, doing her best to sound cheerful and interested. She wasn’t sure what drew her into the shop, since she didn’t knit and had never been particularly keen on crafts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe petite woman greeted her with a shy smile. “Hello and welcome to A Good Yarn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re new here, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe proprietor nodded. “I opened yesterday, and you’re my first customer this afternoon.” She laughed softly. “First customer today,” she corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you knitting?” Carol asked, feeling slightly guilty because she wasn’t a customer at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A sweater for my niece.” She reached for her project and held it up for Carol to examine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colors, lime-green, orange and turquoise, immediately brought a smile to Carol’s face. “That’s so cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you knit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was inevitable. “No, but I’d like to learn someday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you’ve come to the right place. I have a beginners’ class starting next Friday. If you register for the class you get a twenty-percent discount on your yarn purchases.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. I don’t think I’d be any good at knitting.” Carol felt genuinely regretful, but she wasn’t the sort of woman who was comfortable doing things with her hands. Calculating compound interest and figuring annuities, investments and mutual funds—that was where her skills lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t know if you don’t try. I’m Lydia, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carol.” She offered her hand, and Lydia put down her knitting to clasp it warmly. Lydia was petite and small-boned, her dark hair worn short. Her brown eyes shone with intelligence, and Carol liked her right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starting the class with a simple project,” Lydia continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would have to be really simple if I were to take up knitting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I’d have everyone work on a baby blanket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol froze and tears sprang instantly to her eyes. She turned away before Lydia noticed. Under normal circumstances she wasn’t a volatile person, but with the hormone shots, her emotions seemed out of control. This was too weird, though, too much of a coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I will sign up for the class, after all,” she said, fingering a ball of bright yellow yarn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be wonderful.” Lydia walked over to the counter and brought out a clipboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, Carol looked everywhere for signs and portents, and she had frequent conversations with God. Without a doubt she knew she’d been sent to this shop. It was His way of letting her know He was about to answer her prayers. When she went in for the fertilization process this third and final time, she would be successful. In the not-too-distant future she was going to need a baby blanket for her child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALIX TOWNSEND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lix Townsend smashed her cigarette butt into the cracked concrete sidewalk with the toe of her knee-high black combat boots. The manager of Blossom Street Video frowned on employees smoking in the break room and rather than put up with his snide comments, she chose to smoke outside. The man was a prick, anyway, constantly complaining about the staff, the economy and life in general. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-4.html","bookId":1933,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM"}
