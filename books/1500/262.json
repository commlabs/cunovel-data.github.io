She always had endless things to talk about, and Helen was always the best listener.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the underground private hospital, the central laboratory’s thick automatic doors silently opened, revealing Helen who was currently sitting in front of the computer system, lost in her thoughts. She frowned slightly, somewhat surprised as she looked at the doors. Apart from herself, only Persephone had the authority to open these automatic doors. However, this leading female lead who had just given all of Dragon City quite the fright should not be here right now at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone’s face seemed to be covered in a faint layer of light. Her gray pupils that had bits of green inside of them were extremely clear. She walked towards the central laboratory with large steps and sat in front of Helen. She then grabbed the intelligence system out of Helen’s hands, and after sweeping her eyes over it, she noticed that an endless stream of data and information was pouring down the screen. The speed of this stream of data still couldn’t defeat Persephone, she could easily remember the information that refreshed a hundred times each second. If she carefully analyzed it, then she could still still reach the speed of around thirty refreshes per second. The problem laid in the fact that she didn’t really understand the meaning behind this data, nor did she ever like dry and tedious data analysis. As such, she said, “Dear, why are you always looking at such boring stuff?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Hand it over.” Helen’s face was completely expressionless.

Moreover, when Helen was being serious, it was best not to joke around. That was why she obediently handed the intelligence system back into Helen’s hands.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the intelligence system back in her hands, Helen’s eyes immediately shifted from Persephone back to the screen.

What she was scared of hearing the most was this, and as a result, she immediately changed into an extremely brilliant smile and said, “This matter… Right, that, that was a difficult matter to begin with!

Not only did she not get angry, she instead laughed mischievously while sticking to Helen. “Everyone has things they aren’t good at or aren’t interested in! For example, Helen, you don’t have any interest in men, right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen raised her head and indifferently said, “That is just because I don’t have time to waste on those useless men, and there has never been anyone suitable for me. Oh, that’s not correct, now, there is one that barely meets the standards, and that is Su. What? If you aren’t going to take action, why don’t I compete with you, let you see my skill in dealing with men?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she saw Helen’s electronic like eyes that didn’t contain a trace of emotion, Persephone suddenly felt a wave of alarm.

With a somewhat meaningful voice, she said, “Dear, let me remind you one last time. This is the best chance, and it might be the last chance.

The ripples in her eyes seemed to almost spill out.

She shook her head, and then she suddenly sighed. In a rather lonely manner, she said, “Do you know… the greater his potential, the more uneasy I feel.
