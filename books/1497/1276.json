Are you ready?” Xiao Yan took out the four-star Dou Zun skeleton of Feng zun-zhe and placed it gently on the stone platform. After which, his gaze turned towards Yao Lao by the side and spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Yao Lao nodded in a solemn manner. Despite his state of mind, a ripple had involuntarily appeared in his heart at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old Feng, the body refinement, and the merging process this time around might require a period of time. Do not allow anyone to enter the stone tower during this period of time…” Xiao Yan turned his gaze, looked at Feng zun-zhe by the side again and spoke in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can rest assured that the Falling Star Pavilion will enter into a cautious state once you begin. The experts that have gone out will also be summoned back.” Feng zun-zhe’s face was grave as he nodded. Should Yao Lao recover his peak strength, the Falling Star Pavilion would be able to strengthen rapidly. At that time, it would be able to possess some ability to resist the vengeance by the Hall of Soul. Hence, nothing must be allowed to go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan nodded slightly. He gradually calmed his mind. A moment later, he inhaled a deep breath of air. He flicked his finger. The jade bottle that contained the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill slowly drifted towards Yao Lao. Yao Lao was naturally extremely familiar with these steps. He did not hesitate even a little as he extended his hand and received the jade bottle. After which, a thought passed through his heart. A wisp of spirit flew out and lingered beside Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng zun-zhe and Little Fairy Doctor’s group exchanged gazes when they saw that Xiao Yana and Yao Chen had begun. They quietly left the stone tower without even emitting the slightest unusual sound that could interrupt those two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone withdrew without causing Xiao Yan’s attention to be split. The latter’s expression was solemn. He grabbed the wisps of soul beside him before slamming his palm on the skeleton lying on the stone platform, forcefully slamming the soul into the skeleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher, I will first refine the body. Once I succeed, you will be able to enter it and complete the merger step!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan cried out in a low voice. He clenched his hand and a jade bottle appeared within his hand. Green red blood slowly flowed within the jade bottle. A frightening energy fluctuation also spread from within it, causing this entire space to continue vibrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time around, Xiao Yan had prepared top quality items in order to refine a body for Yao Lao. Hence, the difficulty of the refinement would far exceed that from when he had helped Tian Huo zun-zhe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan beckoned with his finger. The green red blood within the jade bottle shot out. Finally, it scattered on the grayish-white bones. Immediately, waves of white smoke erupted. A hissing sound continued to appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zi zi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green red color swiftly scattered when the green red blood touched the grayish white skeleton. Within the blink of an eye, the color of the skeleton had turned from gray to white, transforming into a beautiful green-red color. Moreover, the skeleton also emitted a rich energy ripple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan raised his hand upon seeing this. The green red skeleton suspended in the air by itself. He waved his sleeve and the purple-brown flame surged out immediately, wrapping around the skeleton. The essence blood of the Heaven Demon Phoenix was extremely overbearing. Moreover, it also had difficulty merging. Hence, he must use the Heavenly FLame to grill this energy deep into every bone of this skeleton. Only then would the skeleton be allowed to absorb all of these shocking energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this fierce grilling from the flame, a slight green red light also appeared on the green red bone. Even though this was the case, the high temperature that had seeped in still caused the surface of the skeleton to form a slight bubble. Occasionally, the bubble would burst and a rich energy would spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of tempering and grilling was a process that exhausted a great amount of time. Hence, it continued for nearly an entire day before Xiao Yan finally slowly opened his tightly shut eyes. At this moment, the green-redness on the skeleton had undoubtedly become much dimmer. It no longer possesses the bright color from before. Xiao Yan clearly understood that this was because that energy had gradually seeped deep into the skeleton under the high temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan let out a long breath. He glanced at Yao Lao beside him and the latter nodded with a slight smile. Xiao Yan’s current flame control had undoubtedly advanced very greatly when compared to back then. It could likely even be comparable to his level. This caused Yao Lao to feel pleased. Although he also valued Xiao Yan’s strength, he was after all an alchemist. The pill refinement ability of his disciple was something that he paid most attention to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan also smiled when he saw that pleased expression of Yao Lao. He had just kept the flame when he suddenly thought of something. After hesitating for a moment, he slowly walked towards the stone platform. After which, he violently broke the right arm of the skeleton in front of Yao Lao’s uncertain eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao was startled when he saw Xiao Yan’s action. He did not understand the reason for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try this…” Xiao Yan smiled. He took out the Dou Sheng right arm, which he had obtained from the ancient remains, from his Storage Ring. After which, it was joint onto the right shoulder of the skeleton. Although the size was not very suitable, the two quickly merged completely together after the trimming from Xiao Yan’s flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dou Sheng arm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao’s eyes were outstanding. He saw the jade white bone arm and his expression changed. A shocked expression surged up his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I have obtained it from the ancient remains.” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He said, “Regardless of whether this thing is of any use, its hardness is completely up to standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hardness of the Dou Sheng skeleton was something that Xiao Yan had personally witnessed. This thing definitely possessed its extraordinary point. However, he did not wish to leave it for his own use. Moreover, he was unable to use it even if he wanted to. It was impossible for him to cut his own arm for this thing before joining it to him. He was also uncertain if any sequelae would occur because of it. If it really did exist, he would end up losing more than he has gained. The current Yao Lao did not possess this kind of worry. He did not possess a body. This new body would gradually perfectly merge with him once he entered it. The arm would also truly belong to him in the future…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao nodded slightly. Placing a Dou Sheng arm during this body refinement step was also something that he had never heard before. However, since it was something belonging to a Dou Sheng, it should be quite useful. It might even become an opportunity for him to break through to a Dou Sheng in the future…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter directly connecting the arm onto the skeleton, Xiao Yan once again used the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame to refine it for a while. He finally nodded after the bone hand and the skeleton was perfectly connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long period of refinement, that grayish-white skeleton had also undergone a drastic change in appearance. Its entire body was green and red. Although his right hand still possessed a jade white color, the end of the arm also had some green-red color adhering onto it. The two had completely merged together under the grilling from the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s expression also became serious when he saw this scene. He cried out in a deep voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao nodded. With his old sharp eyes, he was naturally aware that now was the best opportunity. Immediately, he swiftly took out that Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill from the jade bottle and swallowed it. His body swiftly turned illusory, transforming into a ray of light that rushed into the skeleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skeleton trembled violently when Yao Lao’s soul merged into the skeleton. Those empty eye sockets gradually possessed a glow. At the same time, a frightening mysterious energy spread out from the interior of the skeleton. Under this energy, some mysterious flesh had actually begun to appear on the skeleton… the flesh was grown on the white bones. This miracle was naturally brought by the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher, endure on!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s face had become grave as he saw the swiftly wiggling flesh being formed on the skeleton. He let out a low cry and the purple-flame that wrapped around the skeleton immediately burned fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the burning of this flame, the blood and flesh that had just been formed were actually being incinerated into ashes. However, when the ash scattered, a frightening mysterious energy once again spread out. The rate at which the flesh grew became increasingly quick. At the end, it was possible to see the rapid wiggling of the flesh granulation. A blood blurry human outline was swiftly taking shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis burning and growth continued for nearly ten hours. The skin structure of the flesh was completely formed under the grilling of the flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the birth of flesh, the skeleton on the stone platform had also completely turned into a human form. Subsequently, all that remained was to wait for Yao Lao to completely merge with this body. After which… that Yao zun-zhe, who had stunned the continent back then, would be truly able to…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevive from the bath of flames!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, an enormous black large hall crept like a fierce beast from the ancient times within the deep mountains in the western region of the Central Plains. A frightening energy ripple that could chill one’s heart spread vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Puff!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack fog suddenly surged out from all directions within the large hall. A moment later, the black fog gathered. It transformed into many black figures that stood in the empty air. Powerful dark chilling aura swept over this entire place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome ninth Tianzun!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany black figures appeared. Immediately, they knelt down in the sky. Their respectful voice immediately resounded over this entire place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the time that these black shadows were kneeling, the entire space also slowly became distorted. A moment later, a blue figure slowly appeared. A faint voice also sounded along with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do all of you still remember the mission this time around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Destroy the Falling Star Pavilion, capture Xiao Yan and Yao Chen!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly a hundred orderly loud cry simultaneously sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes… let’s get moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue figure nodded slightly. Immediately, his feet gently stepped on the ground. His body moved and slowly disappeared…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen this blue figure disappeared, an elder, who was leading the black clothed people also raised his head. Surprisingly, it was old ghost Zhai Xing. At this moment, his eyes turned towards the northern sky. A ferocious expression surfaced on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, the old me will see just who will rescue you this time around!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1275\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1277\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1276","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
