I whip my head around and find Avi sitting there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aaaahhhhhh!\" I scream at the top of my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi just had a very big peep show starring yours truly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately my scream only alerts SD and Uncle Chime, who come barging into the room. SD\u0027s eyes dart back and forth between Avi and the half-dressed me with the BITCH shorts on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on in here?\" SD barks, accusing me with his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi actually saw me undressed ...my butt, my boobs, my cellulite thighs. My tongue is in shock, just like the rest of me. Even if I could talk, I wouldn\u0027t even know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept I smell a rat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Snotty, who has this very subtle self-satisfied smirk on her face. She\u0027s the rat, no question about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Chime is eyeing Ron accusingly. I know I didn\u0027t do anything, but I feel like a ho nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye I notice Avi standing up. He says something in Hebrew to SD I can\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon says something angrily back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnotty starts arguing with Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Chime stands as straight as a soldier, blocking the door, his hands on his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m just standing here, half naked. I push past Uncle Chime and run to the bathroom. After I put on my tank, I still hear loud arguing coming from Snotty\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the edge of the bathtub until the arguing stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this is my initiation to Israel, I\u0027m scared to find out what the next three months here are going to be like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can attract bees with honey, but why would you want to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jet lag excuse works like a dream on the Sperm Donor my second day in Israel, with the added benefit that I\u0027ve been able to sleep most of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now it\u0027s the late afternoon and I\u0027m fully rested. After grabbing a bite to eat, I put on my jogging outfit, grab my iPod, and head outside. As I venture down the street, I spot Sofia sitting outside on a lounge chair on the edge of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she notices me, she waves me over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jog down the dirt road and stand next to her. Peering down the mountain, at the lake far below, and at the other mountains in the distance takes my breath away. \"Chicago is as flat as ...\" I\u0027m about to say \"Snotty,\" but I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I say, \"We don\u0027t have any mountains where I live. I guess that\u0027s why they make skyscrapers, they\u0027re like Chicago\u0027s mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been to Chicago,\" Safta says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027ll have to come visit me. I can take you to the Sears Tower. You can see, like, four states from the top floor. It\u0027s totally cool. And we have Lake Michigan. It\u0027s so wide you can\u0027t even see across it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get excited thinking about taking her around Chicago when she comes to visit me. She will love Millennium Park, where she can watch people and have lunch on the grass smack dab in the middle of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I bet she\u0027ll love the Art Institute of Chicago and Museum of Science and Industry. The museum has awesome exhibits. My favorite is the dead baby exhibit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s really called the Neonatal exhibit, but I say just tell it like it is. It\u0027s a bunch of real, dead babies of every stage, all encased in formaldehyde or some other liquid. They have about thirty embryos and fetuses that are one week old on up to a full term baby. They even show identical twin embryos. It\u0027s the coolest thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it would be neat to have Safia come visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, getting caught up in the moment. \"I feel like I could scan the whole country from up here.\" Then I think about the malls, miles and miles from here. \"But it\u0027s so far from everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a city girl, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through and through. Give me a Kate Spade purse and a pair of Lucky jeans and I\u0027m a happy girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, the soft, warm sound filling the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it here. Away from the noise, away from crowds. It\u0027s the perfect place on earth for an old woman like me. Besides, at my age I don\u0027t need a Kate Spade purse or Lucky jeans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you were one hot mama when you were a teenager,\" I say, then want to take those words right back. Talking to her like she\u0027s one of my friends is a stupid thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I married your grandfather when I was eighteen years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it love at first sight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I couldn\u0027t stand the sight of him. Until one day he bought me flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers? That\u0027s the oldest trick in the book. \"So he brought you some roses and you fell in love?\" It\u0027s a cute story, if a little boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafta pats my hand. \"No, motek. He bought me the whole flower shop. And the poor man was allergic to pollen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\" I\u0027d be sold if a guy bought me my own Abercrombie and Fitch store. Now, that would be true love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafta starts to get up, and I grab her elbow to help her. Even though she told me she\u0027s fine, I have a feeling I\u0027m not getting the whole story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to lie down,\" she says once she stands. \"Go explore the moshav, your father should be back with dinner soon.\" I watch as she walks back down the dirt path toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I head toward the entrance to the moshav. The winding road will be a great place for me to take a jog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I reach the security booth, a guy sticks his head out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going for a run,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods his head and opens the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I start to jog, the fresh air in my lungs energizes me. The mountainous view is like out of a movie, and the music in my ears reminds me of home. I\u0027m in heaven as my stride matches the rhythm of the song I\u0027m listening to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only Mitch could see me now, jogging down a mountain. He\u0027s a nature nut. My best friend Jessica is, too. She\u0027d probably be jealous of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I\u0027m thinking of Mitch and Jess, I whiz past some white boxes. Only after I pass them do I realize what they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeehives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell are beehives doing on the side of the road?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027m safe, until I see one of the stinging suckers has followed me. \"Go away,\" I say, running faster. The bee flies faster, and he\u0027s doing circles around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop and stand as still as those guards in London who stand at the palace, hoping that will make him go away. But it doesn\u0027t, it only attracts another bee. And another. And another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like time has stopped, except my iPod is still playing music in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help!\" I scream, and take off again. I\u0027m waving my arms around like a madwoman, trying to get the bees off of me. Gross, I think one just got caught in my hair!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd waving my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd shaking my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I spot a car coming up the road, I\u0027m hopeful it\u0027s Ron. But I\u0027m shaking my head around so hard that I don\u0027t see who it is. The car passes me, but then I hear tires screech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run toward the car, until I realize who\u0027s getting out of the driver\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last possible person in the world I want to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in,\" he says, opening up the passenger side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have two options: get in the car with a jerk who saw me buck naked or get stung by seven bees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall me crazy, call me stupid. But I choose option number two. \"Go to hell,\" I say, and keep running down the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout three-quarters of the way down, the bees finally leave me alone. By some miracle, I\u0027ve managed to avoid getting stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I\u0027m stuck at the bottom of the mountain. And I don\u0027t want to go back up and pass the beehives again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a brilliant idea. I\u0027ll wait for the Sperm Donor. Softa said he\u0027ll be coming back soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I wait. And wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-five minutes later, I\u0027m still waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear, this vacation is a total disaster. If I were home, I\u0027d be playing tennis and hanging out with friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour goes by before I spot a car coming up the road. I recognize Doo-Doo. I wave my arms in the air like an air traffic control guy to make him stop. There\u0027s a girl in the car with him. The girl sticks her head out the window. \"Do you need a ride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoo-Doo introduces me to the girl as I hop in the back seat. Her name is Ofra, and she also lives on the moshav. I lean back and enjoy the air conditioning blasting in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O\u0027dead says you\u0027re going to come to the beach with us tonight.\" Ofra turns around and faces me from the front seat. \"It\u0027s a special occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your birthday?\" I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Moron is going to the army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s something to celebrate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfra looks excited when she says, \"You have to bring something of yours to give him, then offer a piece of advice. It\u0027s the moshav ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitual?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027m allergic to rituals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you speak up, make sure you know what you\u0027re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beach we go to is sandy, and borders a huge lake they tell me is called the Kineret. It\u0027s all seven of us tonight: me, Ofra, Snotty, Avi, Moron, Doo-Doo, and O\u0027dead. The guys have made a huge bonfire, and we\u0027re sitting around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi leads Moron to a chair he\u0027s placed in the sand. Then he pulls out a shirt from a bag with Hebrew letters ironed on it. When he holds it up, everyone laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept me, of course, because I have no clue what\u0027s written on the shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\" I ask Ofra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the bathroom?\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I say. \"I guess you\u0027re going to have to wait or pee in the sand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all laugh harder. And I realize they\u0027re laughing at me. \"What?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfra pats my back. \"I wasn\u0027t asking you where the bathroom is, I was telling you that\u0027s what the shirt says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi, speak in English so Amy can understand,\" Ofra says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands there, totally intimidating. \"Beseder,\" he says begrudgingly. \"My friend Moron here has gotten us lost on many occasions. His sense of direction is legendary, to say the least. So with this shirt, he might not be able to find his way home, but he\u0027ll be able to find his way to the nearest sheruteem.\" Then he looks at me and says, \"That means bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else chuckles and claps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my piece of advice is ...don\u0027t flirt with any of the female instructors. They all have access to weapons bigger than yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis amuses everyone. I assume Moron has a reputation for flirting with girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Avi sits down, Ofra and Snotty go up to Moron and give him a wrapped present. He opens it and holds a pair of boxer shorts up to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front is just plain white, but ironed to the back is a map of Israel. \"This way,\" Snotty says, \"when you get lost you can always find your way back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but he\u0027s got to get naked to see the map,\" Doo-Doo says, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, too. Imagining Moron stuck in the middle of the desert, lost, wearing a shirt that says Where\u0027s the bathroom while he\u0027s naked from the waist down as he examines the map on his boxers, is pretty hysterical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfra sits on one of Moron\u0027s legs, and Snotty sits on the other. \"Our piece of advice is ...let us shave your head instead of the army hairdresser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as Ofra pulls a cordless razor out of a bag. Moron gives a nervous smile to the rest of us. To be honest, he has a great head of hair. It\u0027s sandy brown, almost reaches his shoulders, and is really thick. Is he gonna let them shave it off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfra turns on the razor, then she and Snotty stand up and go behind him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-7.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:49 PM"}
