No one is available to take your call, but if you leave your name and number as well as a brief outline of your problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re my problem, Nelson,\" Celluci growled as he dropped the receiver back into the cradle. He glared at the clock on the kitchen wall. Ten twenty-five. Even at this hour of the morning, theoretically well past rush hour, driving from Downsview to the center of town was going to take just about all of that thirty-five minutes. He couldn\u0027t afford to wait any longer; Cantree had an understandable objection to his detectives wandering in to work when it suited them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there was another number he could call. Fits Roy himself would have long ago crawled back into his coffin for the day, but Vicki might still be at his apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci snorted. \"No, at his condominium.\" God, that was such a yuppie word. People who lived in condominiums ate raw fish, drank lite beer, and collected baseball cards for their investment potential. Granted Fitzroy did none of those things, but he still played at the lifestyle. And romance novels? Bad enough for a man to write the asinine things but for a? a? for what Fitzroy was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. He wasn\u0027t calling Fitzroy\u0027s place. It was a big city, Vicki could be anywhere. Very likely she was taking young Tony home and tucking him in. The thought of Vicki in such a maternal role brought a sardonic smile and the thought that followed lifted his eyebrows almost to his hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucking Tony in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Celluci shook his head emphatically. Thinking about Fitzroy was driving his mind right into the gutter. He shrugged into his jacket, grabbed his keys up off the kitchen table, and headed for the door. Vicki no doubt had a good reason for not calling. He trusted her. Maybe Tony\u0027s fears hadn\u0027t been completely unfounded-Fitzroy had been hurt facing the mummy, and she\u0027d taken him wherever one took a hurt? romance writer. He trusted her innate good sense not to have used the information Fitzroy may have brought back and gone out after the mummy herself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And if there isn\u0027t a message waiting for me at the office, I\u0027m going to take her innate good sense and beat her to death with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Great timing, Vicki, I was just on my way out the door. And where the hell have you been anyway? I told you to call me first thing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Celluci, shut up for a minute and listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci blinked. \"Dave?\" His partner didn\u0027t sound like a happy man. \"What\u0027s wrong. It\u0027s not the baby, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, no, she\u0027s fine.\" On the other end of the line, Dave Graham took a deep breath. \"Look, Mike, you\u0027re going to have to lay low for a while. Cantree wants you picked up and brought in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Say what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s got a warrant for your arrest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027On what charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There doesn\u0027t appear to be one. It\u0027s a special?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a fucking setup.\" Celluci grinned, suddenly relieved. \"You didn\u0027t actually believe it, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yeah. I believed it. And you\u0027d better, too.\" Something in Dave\u0027s voice wiped the grin off his face. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on around here today, but they\u0027ve shuffled a couple of departments around, no warning, and that warrant\u0027ll stand. I\u0027ve never seen Cantree so serious about anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shit.\" It was more of an observation than an expletive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You can say that again, buddy-boy. I\u0027m not sure I should ask, but just what have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I found out something I shouldn\u0027t have.\" Celluci considered what Vicki had told him about the Solicitor General\u0027s Halloween party. Cantree. God damn it! The son of a bitch has subverted one of the few honest cops in the city. He had to assume that Fitzroy had been an accurate witness, but the thought of Cantree, of all people, blindly dancing to another man\u0027s tune made him feel physically ill. And he\u0027s dancing right over me. The next time I think there\u0027s a mummy on the rampage in Toronto, I\u0027ll keep my fucking mouth shut. \"Are you calling from headquarters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do I look like an idiot?\" Dave\u0027s voice was dry. \"I\u0027m at the Taco Bell around on Yonge Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good. Look, Dave, this is bigger than just me. Watch your back and, for the next little while, keep a very, very low profile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hey, you don\u0027t need to tell me. There\u0027s something majorly weird going down around here and I\u0027ve never been keen on being strip searched. How do I stay in touch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Uh? good question.\" He could access messages off his machine by remote and as long as the messages were short enough there wouldn\u0027t be time to trace the line back; but they\u0027d be monitoring and that would put Dave right in the toilet with him. Odds were good they\u0027d also be monitoring Vicki\u0027s line. Cantree was well aware how close the two of them had been and how close they\u0027d stayed. Best to keep away from Vicki\u0027s place completely and that included keeping Dave away from Vicki\u0027s answering machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You could call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. Even if they don\u0027t suspect you warned me, they\u0027ll be monitoring your lines. You\u0027re the logical person for me to call. Damn it all to hell anyway!\" He slapped his palm against the table and stared at the scrap of pink memo paper that fluttered down to the floor. Fitzroy? Why not. \"I\u0027ve got a number you can leave a message at. I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll get it until after dark, but it should be safe. Memorize it, don\u0027t write it down, and use?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A public phone line. Mike, I know the drill.\" Dave repeated the number three times to be sure he had it, then warned, \"You better get out of there. Cantree might not have wanted to wait until you came in. He may have sent a car up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m gone. And Dave? Thanks.\" Partners who could be depended on when the chips were down-or sideways-had saved the lives of more cops than a thousand fancy pieces of equipment. \"I owe you one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027One? You still owe me for a half a dozen meals, not to mention getting that asswipe from accounting off your back. Anyway, be careful.\" He hung up before Celluci could reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe careful. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccompanied by a fine libretto of Italian swearing, Celluci threw a few clothes, some papers, and a box of ammunition in a cheap Blue Jays\u0027 gym bag. He had no time to change out of his suit, but the moment he could he\u0027d ditch it for the uniform of the city-jeans and a black leather jacket worked better around Toronto than a cloak of invisibility. Not counting a pocket load of change, he had twenty-seven bucks in his wallet and another hundred in emergency money taped under the seat of the car. He\u0027d take the money; he\u0027d have to leave the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his way out the door, he stopped and glanced back at the phone. Should he leave a message on Fitzroy\u0027s machine for Vicki? A second thought decided him against it. Cantree was likely to have a check run on all the numbers he\u0027d called in the last couple of days and if Fitzroy\u0027s number showed up on the list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good thing I didn\u0027t call it earlier.\" It appeared his ego was looking out for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped the chain on, pulled the door closed, and heard the deadbolt click. His security system had been designed by one of the best break and enter boys in the city. Cantree would probably have the door smashed-the police were often less subtle than those they arrested-but it ought to slow the bastards down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery faintly, through the steel-reinforced oak, he heard the phone ring. It might be Vicki. He couldn\u0027t afford the time it would take to go back and answer it. If it was Vicki? well, Vicki had always been able to take care of herself and besides, she was safe enough for now; Cantree wanted him, not her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holding cell smelled of vomit and urine and cheap booze sweated out through polyester layered over years of too many desperate people and far too little money. A half dozen tired looking whores, waiting for their morning trip to court, huddled in one corner and watched Vicki forced down on the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s she in for?\" asked a tall brunette, adjusting what was either a very wide belt or a very short skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027None of your damned business,\" grunted Mallard struggling with the cuffs, his shoulder pressing Vicki hard against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hooker rolled her eyes. The other nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What was that?\" Gowan asked. His position outside the cage had allowed him to see the expression Mallard had missed. \"You got a problem with the officer\u0027s answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No.\" Her voice dropped just to one side of servile. \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowan smiled. \"Glad to hear it, ladies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression supplicating, she gave him the finger, the gesture carefully hidden behind one of her companions. Working girls learned fast that cops came in two basic varieties. Almost all of them were just regular guys doing a job, but a nasty few would like nothing more than an excuse to pull out their sticks and apply a personal judgment. If fate threw them the latter, maintaining the merchandise dictated ass-kissing as hard and as fast as necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing softly, Mallard yanked the cuffs around on Vicki\u0027s wrists to give him a better angle with the key. \"Goddamned things are stuck a? there.\" They dropped into his hands and he straightened. Without his support, Vicki sagged away from the wall and toppled sideways off the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough voluntary motor functions seemed to be under someone else\u0027s control and all the crevices of her brain had been filled with mashed potatoes, she was completely aware of everything that was going on. This was the Metro East Detention Center on Disco Road. Mallard and Gowan had tossed her bag at the Duty Sergeant and dragged her past saying, \"Wait until you hear the story on this one?\" They were now, obviously, going to leave her in the holding cell. Locked up. They said they had a warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to focus on Mallard\u0027s face. The son of a bitch was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Such a pity when a cop goes bad,\" he said clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCop? God damn it, don\u0027t say I\u0027m a cop. Not here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down and pinched her cheek, hard enough for her to feel it through the drug, and gently resettled her glasses on her nose. \"Wouldn\u0027t want you to miss any of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t leave me here! You can\u0027t just leave me here, you bastard! The thought slammed around inside her head but all that made it out was a kind of stuttering moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll always remember you like this.\" His smile broadened, then he turned and moved back out of her line of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t turn her head fast enough to watch him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeels rang against the concrete floor and Vicki struggled to focus on the young woman now standing over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Christ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Fucking cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe toes of her boots were dangerously pointed. Fortunately, she didn\u0027t know where use them to their best advantage. Nothing broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki made an effort to remember the face behind the garish makeup before pain squeezed her eyes shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Leave her alone, Marian. She\u0027s too stoned to feel it anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel snot running over her upper lip. She could feel something damp soaking through her jeans where her hip pressed against the floor. She\u0027d never felt so desperately helpless in her entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes glowed red and Akhekh fed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How long do you figure the drug will last?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowan shrugged. \"I dunno, a few hours. It\u0027s the same stuff the animal control people use to bring down bears. Doesn\u0027t really matter how long it lasts. After the story we spun, they\u0027re not going to believe a word she says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But what if she gets a lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not where she\u0027s going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Chill out, Mallard.\" Gowan pulled carefully out of the parking spot and waved at the driver of a wagon just coming in. \"Cantree said he needed a couple of days to get the evidence to nail the bitch and we\u0027ve given it to him. It\u0027s his problem now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And hers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaff Sergeant Gowan nodded. \"And hers,\" he repeated in pleased agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whores had been taken away. Vicki didn\u0027t know when. Time moved so slowly she might have been in the holding cell for days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInch by inch, she crawled one arm up the wall far enough for her hand to grab the edge of the bench. It took four tries for her grip to finally hold and another three before she could remember how to bend her elbow. Finally she was sitting, still on the floor but a definite improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive physical effort needed to get this far had held panic at bay but now she could see-thank God, they hadn\u0027t taken her glasses-it rolled over her in turgid red waves that crashed against the backs of her eyes, receded and crashed down again. The only coherent word in the surging tide was NO! so she clutched at it and used it to keep from being pulled under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO! I will not surrender!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp slap on her right cheek gave her a new focus and she managed to drag herself partially free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hey? I said, can you walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki blinked. A guard. The panic receded further and relief flooded in to take its place. They\u0027d realized what had happened and come to get her. She tried to smile and nod at the same time, couldn\u0027t do both so achieved neither, and threw everything she had into a struggle to get to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Atta girl, upsa daisy. Christ,\" the guard grunted as she ended up lifting most of Vicki\u0027s weight. \"Why are the stoners always so fucking big?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second guard, standing at the door of the cage, shrugged. \"At least this one doesn\u0027t stink. I\u0027ll take a head over a drunk any day. Drugs don\u0027t make you puke on your shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Or my shoes,\" the first guard agreed. \"Okay, you\u0027re up. Now then, left foot, right foot. None of us will enjoy it if we have to carry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more of a threat than an encouragement, but Vicki didn\u0027t notice. She could walk. It was shuffling, unsure, and slow, but it was forward locomotion and while both guards seemed merely satisfied, Vicki was overjoyed. She could walk. The drug must be wearing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer relief grew when they took her straight to the Duty Sergeant and pushed her down onto a wooden chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m on my way out of here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So,\" he said when the door closed and they were alone, \"the two officers who brought you in suggested I book you myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBook me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted the warrant with his fingertips. \"They\u0027ve left me a number to call for the official explanation. I can\u0027t wait. Cops who take advantage of their position to molest little kids don\u0027t go down very well with my people, or the inmates either for that matter. The officers seemed to think it would be better if no one else knew what you\u0027d done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t done anything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now they had no idea what drug you\u0027d taken and I can\u0027t wait for it to wear off-if it\u0027s going to wear off-so we\u0027ll just enter your information off the warrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Don\u0027t panic. My name goes into the system, someone\u0027ll recognize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Terri Hanover?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027? age, thirty-two? five-foot ten? one hundred and forty-seven pounds?\" He clicked his tongue. \"Shaved a few pounds off there, did we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s me, but it\u0027s not my name. Detectives were issued fake ID all the time and her specs were probably still on file. What the hell is going on ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his fingers against the keyboard began to sound like nails pounding into a cage being built around her. She couldn\u0027t just sit there and let it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not who they say I am!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept her mouth refused to form the words. Nothing came out except guttural noises and a trickle of saliva that ran off her chin to drip slowly into the hollow of her collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now then,\" he set the keyboard to one side and reached for the phone, \"let\u0027s see what headquarters has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Solicitor General\u0027s office. One moment please, he\u0027s expecting your call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone on Zottie\u0027s desk buzzed but the Solicitor General just stared at it, a puzzled smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Pick it up,\" Tawfik commanded softly. The man would not last much longer. Fortunately, he wouldn\u0027t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Zottie here. Ah, yes, Sergeant Baldwin. Well, actually, it\u0027s not me you should be talking to. Hold on?\" He passed the receiver to Tawfik, then lapsed back into semi-awareness as Tawfik began to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Solicitor General? Oh, God, then that means?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his initial enthusiastic greeting, the Duty Sergeant said little. Finally, even the monosyllables faded into a blank stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the panic came with words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mummy put me here. Not Mallard and Gowan. The mummy. Christ. I should have remembered Cantree is under its control. But why? How? It doesn\u0027t know about me. Henry. Henry talked to it. Did Henry betray me? Without meaning to? Meaning to? Henry? Or Mike. It found out about Celluci. He was there. At the museum. It got Celluci. Took what it needed to know. I\u0027m just another loose end. Mike? Are you dead? Are you dead? Are you dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t breathe. It hurt to breathe. She couldn\u0027t remember how to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe? mummy? has? to? be? stopped. And if Mike Celluci was dead? His death must be avenged. A? venged. She breathed in the first syllable and breathed out the second. A? venged. A? venged. Avenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstand what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It will be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes wide, unable to look away, Vicki watched him hang up the phone, pick up the warrant, her warrant, and walk over to the shredder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been entered into the system and as far as the system was concerned she now belonged here until they pulled her for a court appearance. Court appearances were booked by warrant. Without a warrant, she would rot here forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could jump the sergeant. Hold him hostage. Call the newspapers! Call? call someone. I can\u0027t just disappear! But her body still refused to obey. She felt muscles tense, and then go slack, and then she began to tremble, unable to stop it or control it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Baldwin looked down at the shredder, frowned, and brushed one hand over the gray fringe of his hair. \"Dickson!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sarge?\" The guard who had lifted Vicki to her feet back in the holding cell, opened the door and stuck her head into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I want you to search Ms. Hanover and then take her down to Special Needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To the nut bars?\" Dickson\u0027s brows rose. \"You sure she shouldn\u0027t go to the hospital? She doesn\u0027t look so good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sergeant snorted. \"Neither did the kid when she got through seeing to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki heard the guard\u0027s voice pick up an edge; skinbeefs against children were universally despised. Strong fingers closed around her upper arm and heaved her up and out of the chair. Shoved toward the door, she struggled to remember how to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, and Dickson? I want it to be a thorough search.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Aw, come on, Sarge!\" The guard\u0027s grip loosened a little as she turned to protest the order. \"I had to do the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And you get to do this one, too. Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki heard Dickson grunt as she caught something heavy and managed to get her head turned enough to see that it was her black leather shoulder bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard looked down at the huge, bulging bag in disbelief. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It came with her. When you\u0027ve got her put away, you can enter the contents in her file.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027ll take days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All the more reason to get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why me?\" Dickson muttered, throwing the bag over her shoulder and dragging Vicki out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grip on her arm had not been retightened. While going through the crowded doorway, Vicki attempted to twist free, reaching for her bag. If she could get her hands on it, it would make a decent weapon. She shouldn\u0027t be here. Anything to attract attention?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t do that,\" Dickson sighed, effortlessly bouncing her off the wall and then propelling her forward. \"I\u0027m not having a very good day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strip search was worse than Vicki could have imagined although, as she\u0027d regained some gross motor control on the walk down the hall, it wasn\u0027t as bad as it could have been. Trapped inside her own head, there wasn\u0027t anything she could do but endure. She didn\u0027t blame Dickson, the guard was just doing her job, but when she got out of there Gowan and Mallard were going to be having their balls for breakfast. The image helped sustain her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDickson peeled off the rubber glove and tossed it into the trash. \"These things only come in two sizes,\" she said, replacing the clothing Vicki had removed with jail issue. \"Too big and too small. Can you dress yourself, Hanover?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yuh?\" My God, that was almost a word! She tried it again, humiliation wiped out in that one small victory over her body. \"Yuh, yuh, yuh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay, okay, I get the picture. Jesus, you\u0027re drooling again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every article of clothing a small measure of control returned. Her movements were still jerky and unsure, but somehow she struggled into the jail blues, oblivious to the bored stare of the guard, oblivious to anything but the battle she fought with her body. Hands worked. Fingers didn\u0027t. Her sense of balance was still skewed and large movements nearly tipped her over but she leaned against the wall and got into the underwear, the jeans, and the shoes. The T-shirt nearly defeated her. She couldn\u0027t find the opening for her head and began to panic. Outside hands yanked it down, nearly taking her nose with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, Hanover. I haven\u0027t got all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cotton overshirt with its wide v-neck was a little easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drug\u0027s wearing off. Thank God. As soon as I can talk, someone\u0027s going to get one hell of an earful. As carefully as if she were threading a needle, Vicki reached for her glasses. Dickson reached them first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Forget that. You\u0027ll just have to squint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had never occurred to her that they wouldn\u0027t let her keep her glasses. Of course they wouldn\u0027t. Not in Special Needs. Glasses could be used as weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can\u0027t see without my glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the composure she\u0027d managed to gain with the control over her muscles fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was what she\u0027d been terrified of since the retinitis pigmentosa had been diagnosed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nuh!\" Using her arm like a club, she knocked the other woman\u0027s hand away and attempted to snatch her glasses up off the pile of discarded clothing. But her fingers wouldn\u0027t close fast enough and a sharp shove from the guard sent her lurching back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Here, none of that! You show fight and you wear the restraints. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t understand. My glasses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething of Vicki\u0027s fear must have shown on her face. Dickson frowned and said brusquely, \"Look, Hanover, you convince the shrink you don\u0027t belong in Special Needs and we\u0027ll give you your glasses back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope. The psychiatrist would listen to her. Probably even recognize the drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now come on, I haven\u0027t got all day. Christ, it\u0027ll probably take me the rest of the shift just to list what you\u0027ve got in that bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world had condensed into a fuzzy tunnel. Vicki shuffled along it, heart leaping as doors and furniture and people loomed up without warning. She cracked her knee on the edge of something and slammed her shoulder into a corner she couldn\u0027t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDickson sighed as she steered her charge through the first of the locked doors and onto the range. \"Maybe you\u0027d do better if you just closed your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise was overwhelming; the clatter of a busy cafeteria with the volume control gone and so many women\u0027s voices that all individual sound was lost. The smell of food overpowered the smell of prison. Vicki suddenly realized that she hadn\u0027t eaten since about nine o\u0027clock the evening before. Her mouth flooded with saliva and her stomach growled audibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Great timing, Dickson,\" called a new voice. \"We\u0027re just counting the spoons. You\u0027ll have to keep her out here until we finish and lock \u0027em in for cleanup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, joy, oh, bliss,\" Dickson muttered. Vicki tensed as the guard pushed her back until her shoulder blades pressed against the concrete wall. \"Stay there. Don\u0027t move. You\u0027ve missed lunch, but considering the food in here, that might be a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki could feel people staring. The bars were a hazy grid at the edge of her vision and beyond that she could make out only a shifting sea of blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hair on the back of her neck rose. You\u0027re only in there until you talk to the shrink. You don\u0027t need to see anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her right, she could hear the clatter of spoons against a plastic tray and then the new guard\u0027s voice rising above the noise. \"So, what\u0027ve you got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Skinbeef. Brain-fried, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Violent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Barely mobile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can she piss in the pot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, thank God for small mercies. I\u0027ve already got four that have to be hosed down. Where the fuck am I supposed to put her though, that\u0027s the question. I\u0027m three down in fifteen out of eighteen cells now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Put her in with Lambert and Wills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the long pause that followed, Vicki realized the two guards were talking about her. As though she wasn\u0027t there. As though she didn\u0027t matter. Because she didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Skinbeef, eh?\" The second pause had a more ominous sound. \"How old was the kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, I think Lambert and Wills will make her feel real welcome.\" She raised her voice. \"All right, you lot, get inside, you know the drill. Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake, Naylor, take Chin with you. You know she gets lost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually the sea of blue receded, turned into separate shapes, then disappeared. Vicki heard the sound of steel doors closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shu? shu? shu??\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What the hell are you muttering about?\" Dickson\u0027s face swam into focus as she grabbed Vicki\u0027s arm above the elbow and tugged her toward the set of double doors that led into the cell block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, the shrink. Hey, Cowan, the shrink been in yet today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yeah. Came and left before lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You heard her. Looks like you\u0027re in here until Wednesday at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday. Monday\u0027s half over. Then Tuesday. Then Wednesday. But the shrink came in the morning. So really only two days. Half of Monday, Tuesday, and half of Wednesday. I can do two days. I can make it. Even without my glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped in front of one of the cells and Vicki was willing to take any odds that the two women inside were watching her suspiciously from their bunks. The cells were built for two, a third meant the beginning of crowding that often went as high as five. She intended to move quietly into the cell, but her legs froze at the threshold and the panic started to rise again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, Hanover, move it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shove in the small of her back catapulted her forward and after three wild steps she crashed to her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s okay. It\u0027s only two days. Once the drug is gone, I\u0027ll be fine. These people are crazy. I\u0027m not. Slowly, carefully, she got to her feet. Behind her, she heard the cell door locked and Dickson moving away. Even if the mummy got to Henry, or Celluci-and dealing with that possibility would have to wait-it can\u0027t have gotten to the psychiatrist. Two days. I\u0027ll be out of here in two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bunk to her right squealed a protest as the woman reclining on it swung to her feet. Hands held out from her sides, Vicki turned to face her cell mate. Remember, she\u0027s crazy. Probably confused. Lost. You\u0027re not. Two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCropped gray hair and a tiny, whippet-thin frame. Large dark eyes in a face that seemed all points. Something familiar? but Vicki couldn\u0027t see well enough to determine what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, well, well. Will wonders never cease.\" The voice sound low and clear and frighteningly sane. \"Isn\u0027t it amazing the people you meet in these places, Natalie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grunt from the other bunk could\u0027ve meant anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki felt a dry palm and fingers wrap around her right hand. Her knuckles began to rub painfully. She tried to return the pressure without much effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s so nice to see you again, Detective Nelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLambert. Angel Lambert. What the hell is she doing in Special Needs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027? you can\u0027t imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, I can?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nelson Investigations. No one is available to take your call, but?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Damn it, Vicki, where the fuck are you?\" Celluci slammed down the receiver and slammed out of the phone booth. Vicki never used her answering machine when she was home. So she wasn\u0027t home. So where was she? He\u0027d left a message on Fitzroy\u0027s machine and called Vicki\u0027s apartment half a dozen times from half a dozen different areas in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was probably out working; tracking the mummy, gathering information; maybe even doing her laundry or the grocery shopping. He had no reason to believe she might be in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCantree\u0027s looking for me. Dave would\u0027ve mentioned it if she\u0027d been pulled into this as well. Trouble was, Cantree, not to mention a good part of the force, knew about their relationship. And if Fitzroy had found something out about the mummy that Vicki thought she could use, and then she had, Cantree and the Metro Police could be the least of her worries. She was a good cop. One of the best. You don\u0027t get to be one of the best without learning not to throw yourself at a superior force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that takes care of Cantree and the mummy, Celluci told himself. Vicki\u0027s fine. There\u0027s no reason to believe she\u0027s in any danger just because she didn\u0027t call you when she said she was going to. You\u0027re the one up shit creek without the paddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lit a cigarette, shoved his hands back into his pockets, and slouched down the street, trying not to inhale-a haze of cigarette smoke made an almost impenetrable camouflage when people thought they were looking for a non-smoker. It had been one of Vicki\u0027s tricks for going undercover and he suddenly realized how much he\u0027d been counting on her help. Sure, she rushes right over when Fitzroy needs her, but when my balls are in the fire where is she? ? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-lines-vicki-nelson-3/page-13.html","bookId":2466,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:30 PM"}
