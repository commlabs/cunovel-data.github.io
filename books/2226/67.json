The prime difference between the elements... the difference between... we need a number... \"Wait!\" she said. \"The word \u0027difference\u0027 has multiple meanings. We need a number-so we\u0027re talking math. It\u0027s another of Tankado\u0027s word games-\u0027difference\u0027 means subtraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Becker agreed from the screen overhead. \"Maybe the elements have different numbers of protons or something? If you subtract-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right!\" Jabba said, turning to Soshi. \"Are there any numbers on that chart? Proton counts? Half-lives?

What\u0027s the supercritical mass of uranium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoshi searched. \"Um... 110 pounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One hundred ten?\" Jabba looked suddenly hopeful. \"What\u0027s 35.2 from 110?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventy-four point eight,\" Susan snapped. \"But I don\u0027t think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of my way,\" Jabba commanded, plowing toward the keyboard. \"That\u0027s got to be the kill-code! The difference between their critical masses! Seventy-four point eight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Susan said, peering over Soshi\u0027s shoulder. \"There\u0027s more here. Atomic weights. Neutron counts. Extraction techniques.\" She skimmed the chart. \"Uranium splits into barium and krypton; plutonium does something else. Uranium has 92 protons and 146 neutrons, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need the most obvious difference,\" Midge chimed in. \"The clue reads \u0027the primary difference between the elements.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ!\" Jabba swore. \"How do we know what Tankado considered the primary difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid interrupted. \"Actually, the clue reads prime, not primary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word hit Susan right between the eyes. \"Prime!\" she exclaimed. \"Prime!\" She spun to Jabba. \"The kill-code is a prime number! Think about it! It makes perfect sense!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba instantly knew Susan was right. Ensei Tankado had built his career on prime numbers. Primes were the fundamental building blocks of all encryption algorithms-unique values that had no factors other than one and themselves. Primes worked well in code writing because they were impossible for computers to guess using typical number-tree factoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoshi jumped in. \"Yes! It\u0027s perfect! Primes are essential to Japanese culture! Haiku uses primes. Three lines and syllable counts of five, seven, five. All primes. The temples of Kyoto all have-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Jabba said. \"Even if the kill-code is a prime, so what! There are endless possibilities!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan knew Jabba was right. Because the number line was infinite, one could always look a little farther and find another prime number. Between zero and a million, there were over 70,000 choices. It all depended on how large a prime Tankado decided to use. The bigger it was, the harder it was to guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be huge.\" Jabba groaned. \"Whatever prime Tankado chose is sure to be a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA call went up from the rear of the room. \"Two-minute warning!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba gazed up at the VR in defeat. The final shield was starting to crumble. Technicians were rushing everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in Susan told her they were close. \"We can do this!\" she declared, taking control. \"Of all the differences between uranium and plutonium, I bet only one can be represented as a prime number! That\u0027s our final clue. The number we\u0027re looking for is prime!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba eyed the uranium/plutonium chart on the monitor and threw up his arms. \"There must be a hundred entries here! There\u0027s no way we can subtract them all and check for primes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of the entries are nonnumeric,\" Susan encouraged. \"We can ignore them. Uranium\u0027s natural, plutonium\u0027s man-made. Uranium uses a gun barrel detonator, plutonium uses implosion. They\u0027re not numbers, so they\u0027re irrelevant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" Fontaine ordered. On the VR, the final wall was eggshell thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabba mopped his brow. \"All right, here goes nothing. Start subtracting. I\u0027ll take the top quarter. Susan, you\u0027ve got the middle. Everybody else split up the rest. We\u0027re looking for a prime difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds, it was clear they\u0027d never make it. The numbers were enormous, and in many cases the units didn\u0027t match up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s apples and goddamn oranges,\" Jabba said. \"We\u0027ve got gamma rays against electromagnetic pulse. Fissionable against unfissionable. Some is pure. Some is percentage. It\u0027s a mess!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s got to be here,\" Susan said firmly. \"We\u0027ve got to think.

She\u0027d created a second document window and was perusing the rest of the Outlaw Labs document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Fontaine demanded. \"Find something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, sort of.\" She sounded uneasy. \"You know how I told you the Nagasaki bomb was a plutonium bomb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" they all replied in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Soshi took a deep breath. \"Looks like I made a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" Jabba choked. \"We\u0027ve been looking for the wrong thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoshi pointed to the screen. They huddled around and read the text: ...the common misconception that the Nagasaki bomb was a plutonium bomb. In fact, the device employed uranium, like its sister bomb in Hiroshima.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\" Susan gasped. \"If both elements were uranium, how are we supposed to find the difference between the two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Tankado made a mistake,\" Fontaine ventured. \"Maybe he didn\u0027t know the bombs were the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Susan sighed. \"He was a cripple because of those bombs.

Soshi frantically scrolled backward and found the spot. \"Yes!
