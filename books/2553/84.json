Zero leaned forward as Patrick piloted them toward the freeway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow the signs toward the Goethals Bridge,\" he told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Romy, huddled against the passenger door at the far end of the front seat, staring dead ahead without blinking, looking as if she were in a trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve really done it now, Zero thought. I\u0027ve lost her. She\u0027ll never trust me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeerm whimpered at his side. She was curled next to him on the rear seat. He laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. Tome and Kek hunched behind them in the open rear section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goethals,\" Patrick said. \"Got it. But I think...I think we...\" He seemed to run out of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you deserve an explanation,\" Zero said. \"Of course you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean,\" Patrick said, \"I feel as if the world just tipped ninety degrees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero glanced again at Romy who still hadn\u0027t moved. She\u0027d known him so much longer than Patrick. Her world must feel even further out of kilter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not human?\" Patrick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you tell Meerm that you\u0027re a sim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how come you don\u0027t...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...look like the average sim? I\u0027m one of the earliest, so early that you\u0027ll find no UPC tattoo on the nape of my neck. Plus I\u0027m a mutant - bigger and paler than my brother sims - too big and too human- looking for the workforce. So they kept me separate. I was raised in SimGen\u0027s basic research facility and after a while I became a mascot of sorts. My only contacts growing up were the Sinclair brothers and their most trusted techs. Later, when Harry Carstairs arrived to take over sim training, he took a special interest in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry...how he\u0027d loved Harry Carstairs. The man\u0027s daily visits had been the high point of his adolescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was impressed by my linguistic skills so he tested my intelligence; when he found it to be not only far above sim average but above human average as well, he and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut himself off. Better not mention Ellis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got permission to see how far they could take me. I learned to read, and built up my own library; I was never allowed out of basic research, but television gave me a window onto the rest of the world. Harry and I...I guess you might say we bonded. He taught me to play chess and we spent hours hovering over the board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe missed Harry, especially their chess games. Every so often Zero would give in to a compulsion to see the man. He\u0027d sneak by Harry\u0027s house at night and watch him as he sat and played chess against his computer; he\u0027d longed to knock on the window and challenge him to a game. But Harry believed him dead, and had to go on believing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick said, \"But how did you graduate from SimGen mascot to Zero, SimGen nemesis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always been called Zero. I imagine it\u0027s derived from part of my serial number when I was an embryo. As for my \u0027graduation\u0027...I believe I became inconvenient. Here I was, this man-size sim who was an evolutionary and commercial dead end. Somewhere along the line, a corporate decision was made to terminate me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Patrick whispered. \"Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were they going to do - shoot you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An injection. They drew blood from me at regular intervals. This time they were going to put something in instead of take something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero saw Romy glance quickly over her shoulder, then return to her thousand mile stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scumbags,\" Patrick muttered, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one, Zero thought. Mercer Sinclair had made the unilateral decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at Meerm who\u0027d closed her eyes and seemed to be dozing. Termination would have been her fate if Portero had found her first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick asked, \"How\u0027d you manage to escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found I had a highly placed ally in the company who arranged to fake my death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis again. He\u0027d told his brother that he didn\u0027t want a stranger terminating Zero, that he\u0027d do it himself. But he injected Zero with a sedative instead of poison, cremated another dead sim in his place, and spirited him out of SimGen. He told Zero everything, and set him up with a steady flow of cash and data aimed toward one purpose: to stop SimGen and free his brother sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This ally is the source of all your inside information, I take it,\" Patrick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick shook his head again. \"A high-up inside SimGen working against it. Is he nuts or does he have a personal beef with the Sinclairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both, I think. But it\u0027s also a moral issue with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll true. But Zero had always sensed something else driving Ellis Sinclair, almost as if he felt he had to atone for something. Something \"unspeakable,\" perhaps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick laughed. \"Put a sim in charge of bringing down the makers of sims. I\u0027ve got to say, it has a nice symmetry to it. And now that we\u0027ve got Meerm, it looks like your job is just about over. Congratulations, Zero. They chose the right man. I mean sim. I mean - hell, I don\u0027t know what I mean. All I can say is I never had an inkling you weren\u0027t human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now we come to the crucial junction, Zero thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it bother you that I\u0027m not?\" He directed the question at Patrick but he was watching Romy. He thought he saw her flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. You\u0027re not like Tome or any other sim I\u0027ve met. In fact, you\u0027re more human than some humans I know. Smarter too. What a world! But you haven\u0027t steered me wrong yet. So I guess the answer is no. To tell the truth, every day I\u0027m getting less and less sure about what exactly \u0027human\u0027 means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBless you, Patrick, he thought, then looked at Romy. He couldn\u0027t bear her silence any longer. This had to be dragged out in the open now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Romy?\" he said. \"You haven\u0027t said a word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few seconds, she didn\u0027t move, then she twisted swiftly in her seat and faced him. Angry tears streaked her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never told you I was human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You pretended to be!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never pretended to be anything other than who I am. I didn\u0027t even change my name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hid yourself - that was a lie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I had to. Would you have joined me if you\u0027d known I was a sim? A mutant sim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer angry expression faltered, then she turned away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think, Romy. When was I ever untrue to you? Were the goals of our activities against SimGen ever other than what I said they were? Have I ever misled you into doing something that you didn\u0027t want to do, or worked you toward an end that wasn\u0027t your own as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replied in a tiny voice. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then can I ask you why you\u0027re so angry at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says I\u0027m angry at you?\" she said in that same small voice. \"Maybe I\u0027m angry at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaffled, he replied, \"I don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up a hand. \"Can we just leave it be? I\u0027ve got some adjusting to do and I need some time. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand, but I need to know: Are you still with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded without speaking, without looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero leaned back and closed his eyes to hold back the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while Patrick said, \"Goethals Bridge dead ahead. Why do we want that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s the quickest route out of Jersey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Cannon\u0027s.\" He took one of Meerm\u0027s hands in his. \"We\u0027re bringing her the most important patient of her career.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-84.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
