His hands, still clad in Howard Cottrell\u0027s blue mittens, seized the top strap and pulled it free as the hedge lion roared behind him-a sound that seemed to be more in his head than outside of it. A hard, brambly slap to his left leg, making the knee sing with pain as it was driven in a way the joint had never been expected to bend. A groan escaped Hallorann\u0027s clenched teeth. It would come for the kill any time now, tired of playing with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fumbled for the second strap. Sticky blood ran in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Roar! Slap!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one raked across his buttocks, almost tumbling him over and away from the snowmobile again. He held on-no exaggeration-for dear life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he had freed the second strap. He clutched the gascan to him as the lion struck again, rolling him over on his back. He saw it again, only a shadow in the darkness and falling snow, as nightmarish as a moving gargoyle. Hallorann twisted at the can\u0027s cap as the moving shadow stalked him, kicking up snowpuffs. As it moved in again the cap spun free, releasing the pungent smell of the gasoline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann gained his knees and as it came at him, lowslung and incredibly quick, he splashed it with the gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a hissing, spitting sound and it drew back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gas!\" Hallorann cried, his voice shrill and breaking. \"Gonna burn you, baby! Dig on it awhile!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lion came at him again, still spitting angrily. Hallorann splashed it again but this time the lion didn\u0027t give. It charged ahead. Hallorann sensed rather than saw its head angling at his face and he threw himself backward, partially avoiding it. Yet the lion still hit his upper rib cage a glancing blow, and a flare of pain struck there. Gas gurgled out of the can, which he still held, and doused his right hand and arm, cold as death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he lay on his back in a snow angel, to the right of the snowmobile by about ten paces. The hissing lion was a bulking presence to his left, closing in again. Hallorann thought he could see its tail twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yanked Cottrell\u0027s mitten off his right hand, tasting sodden wool and gasoline. He ripped up the hem of the parka and jammed his hand into his pants pocket. Down in there, along with his keys and his change, was a very battered old Zippo lighter. He had bought it in Germany in 1954. Once the hinge had broken and he had returned it to the Zippo factory and they had repaired it without charge, just as advertised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nightmare flood of thoughts flooding through his mind in a split second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Dear Zippo my lighter was swallowed by a crocodile dropped front an airplane lost in the Pacific trench saved me from a Kraut bullet in the Battle of the Bulge dear Zippo if this fucker doesn\u0027t go that lion is going to rip my head off)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lighter was out. He clicked the hood back. The lion, rushing at him, a growl like ripping cloth, his finger flicking the striker wheel, spark, flame,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(my hand)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis gasoline-soaked hand suddenly ablaze, the flames running up the sleeve of the parka, no pain, no pain yet, the lion shying from the torch suddenly blazing in front of it, a hideous flickering hedge sculpture with eyes and a mouth, shying away, too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWincing at the pain, Hallorann drove his blazing arm into its stiff and scratchy side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant the whole creature was in flames, a prancing, writhing pyre on the snow. It bellowed in rage and pain, seeming to chase its flaming tail as it zigzagged away from Hallorann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrust his own arm deep into the snow, killing the flames, unable to take his eyes from the hedge lion\u0027s death agonies for a moment. Then, gasping, he got to his feet. The arm of Durkin\u0027s parka was sooty but unburned, and that also described his hand. Thirty yards downhill from where he stood, the hedge lion had turned into a fireball. Sparks flew at the sky and were viciously snatched away by the wind. For a moment its ribs and skull were etched in orange flame and then it seemed to collapse, disintegrate, and fall into separate burning piles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Never mind it. Get moving.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the gascan and struggled over to the snowmobile. His consciousness seemed to be flickering in and out, offering him cuttings and snippets of home movies but never the whole picture. In one of these he was aware of yanking the snowmobile back onto its tread and then sitting on it, out of breath and incapable of moving for a few moments. In another, he was reattaching the gascan, which was still half-full. His bead was thumping horribly from the gasfumes (and in reaction to his battle with the hedge lion, he supposed), and he saw by the steaming hole in the snow beside him that he had vomited, but he was unable to remember when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowmobile, the engine still warm, fired immediately. He twisted the throttle unevenly and started forward with a series of neck-snapping jerks that made his head ache even more fiercely. At first the snowmobile wove drunkenly from side to side, but by half-standing to get his face above the windscreen and into the sharp, needling blast of the wind, he drove some of the stupor out of himself. He opened the throttle wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Where are the rest of the hedge animals?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know, but at least he wouldn\u0027t be caught unaware again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Overlook loomed in front of him, the lighted first-floor windows throwing long yellow rectangles onto the snow. The gate at the foot of the drive was locked and he dismounted after a wary look around, praying he hadn\u0027t lost his keys when he pulled his lighter out of his pocket... no, they were there. He picked through them in the bright light thrown by the snowmobile headlamp. He found the right one and unsnapped the padlock, letting it drop into the snow. At first he didn\u0027t think he was going to be able to move the gate anyway; he pawed frantically at the snow surrounding it, disregarding the throbbing agony in his head and the fear that one of the other lions might be creeping up behind him. He managed to pull it a foot and a half away from the gatepost, squeezed into the gap, and pushed. He got it to move another two feet, enough room for the snowmobile, and threaded it through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe became aware of movement ahead of him in the dark. The hedge animals, all of them, were clustered at the base of the Overlook\u0027s steps, guarding the way in, the way out. The lions prowled. The dog stood with its front paws on the first step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann opened the throttle wide and the snowmobile leaped forward, puffing snow up behind it. In the caretaker\u0027s apartment, Jack Torrance\u0027s head jerked around at the high, wasplike buzz of the approaching engine, and suddenly began to move laboriously toward the hallway again. The bitch wasn\u0027t important now. The bitch could wait. Now it was this dirty nigger\u0027s turn. This dirty, interfering nigger with his nose in where it didn\u0027t belong. First him and then his son. He would show them. He would show them that... that he... that he was of managerial timber!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the snowmobile rocketed along faster and faster. The hotel seemed to surge toward it. Snow flew in Hallorann\u0027s face. The headlamp\u0027s oncoming glare spotlighted the hedge shepherd\u0027s face, its blank and socketless eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it shrank away, leaving an opening. Hallorann yanked at the snowmobile\u0027s steering gear with all his remaining strength, and it kicked around in a sharp semicircle, throwing up clouds of snow, threatening to tip over. The rear end struck the foot of the porch steps and rebounded. Hallorann was off in a flash and running up the steps. He stumbled, fell, picked himself up. The dog was growling-again in his head-close behind him. Something ripped at the shoulder of the parka and then he was on the porch, standing in the narrow corridor Jack had shoveled through the snow, and safe. They were too big to fit in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the big double doors which gave on the lobby and dug for his keys again. While he was getting them he tried the knob and it turned freely. He pushed his way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny!\" he cried hoarsely. \"Danny, where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes traveled across the lobby to the foot of the wide stairs and a harsh gasp escaped him. The rug was splashed and matted with blood. There was a scrap of pink terrycloth robe. The trail of blood led up the stairs. The banister was also splashed with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Jesus,\" he muttered, and raised his voice again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny! DANNY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel\u0027s silence seemed to mock him with echoes which were almost there, sly and oblique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Danny? Who\u0027s Danny? Anybody here know a Danny? Danny, Danny, who\u0027s got the Danny? Anybody for a game of spin the Danny? Pin the tail on the Danny? Get out of here, black boy. No one here knows Danny from Adam.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, had he come through everything just to be too late? Had it been done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran up the stairs two at a time and stood at the top of the first floor. The blood led down toward the caretaker\u0027s apartment. Horror crept softly into his veins and into his brain as he began to walk toward the short hall. The hedge animals had been bad, but this was worse. In his heart he was already sure of what he was going to find when he got down there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in no hurry to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had been hiding in the elevator when Hallorann came up the stairs. Now he crept up behind the figure in the snowcoated parka, a bloodand gore-streaked phantom with a smile upon its face. The roque mallet was lifted as high as the ugly, ripping pain in his back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(?? did the bitch stick me can\u0027t remember??)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black boy,\" he whispered. \"I\u0027ll teach you to go sticking your nose in other people\u0027s business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann heard the whisper and began to turn, to duck, and the roque mallet whistled down. The hood of the parka matted the blow, but not enough. A rocket exploded in his head, leaving a contrail of stars... and then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe staggered against the silk wallpaper and Jack hit him again, the roque mallet slicing sideways this time, shattering Hallorann\u0027s cheekbone and most of the teeth on the left side of his jaw. He went down limply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Jack whispered. \"Now, by Christ\" Where was Danny? He had business with his trespassing son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree minutes later the elevator door banged open on the shadowed third floor. Jack Torrance was in it alone. The car had stopped only halfway into the doorway and he had to boost himself up onto the hall floor, wriggling painfully like a crippled thing. He dragged the splintered roque mallet after him. Outside the eaves, the wind howled and roared. Jack\u0027s eyes rolled wildly in their sockets. There was blood and confetti in his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis son was up here, up here somewhere. He could feel it. Left to his own devices, he might do anything: scribble on the expensive silk wallpaper with his crayons, deface the furnishings, break the windows. He was a liar and a cheat and he would have to be chastised... harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Torrance struggled to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny?\" he called. \"Danny, come here a minute, will you? You\u0027ve done something wrong and I want you to come f and take your medicine like a man. Danny? Danny!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-51.html","bookId":2574,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM"}
