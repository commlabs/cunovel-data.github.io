Once past a check point, the body and mind relaxed, and hidden thoughts strayed to surface. If she was guilty of anything, her relief at having made it this far would be apparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to appear normal. Most people would be slightly nervous before a job interview and Claire all owed herself some mild anxiety. Nothing out of the ordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator door slid open. Claire stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed and the aerodynamic cabin accelerated upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaped like an elongated flower bud, the Guardian Building contained an inner core of offices and working spaces, up the side of which the elevator now climbed. This inner core sat within an outer shel of twisting steel beams forming a diagonal grid, the outer surface of the bud. Solar glass panels sheathed the diagonal spaces between the twisting beams, flooding the inside of the building with a warm golden light that set the polished granite floor of the enormous lobby aglow. The diagrid must\u0027ve been enormously heavy, but bathed in the sunlight, it seemed ethereal, almost weightless. It was so beautiful, it felt magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer memory served up the recol ection of her home world, spare boxes of skyscrapers, canyon streets, her grey apartment, the steel and worn plastic of the spartan spaceship she\u0027d boarded two weeks ago... She couldn\u0027t decide if those memories were a nightmare or if this airy building with its bright colors and smiling people in vivid clothes was a lovely delusional dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep inside, beneath her shields, anxiety churned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking it to this planet had been a miracle. If her shields failed, she faced immediate deportation. She couldn\u0027t go back. Not after seeing this. Besides, if she was deported back to Uley, she\u0027d never make it out of spaceport. There would be a death squad waiting for her at the spacecraft\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow her people moved through the lobby. The men wore formfitting black and grey, the women chose flowing dresses and bright colors. What must it be like to come to work here every day? Did they ever become immune to this beauty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator stopped. Claire sighed, loathe to leave the view behind, turned and exited into a narrow hal way, its indigo, almost black, wal s reflective like a dark mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove her, long ribbons of dark blue luminescent plastic, set on their edge, ran paral el to each other, curving and twisting like three-dimensional current of a river. The transparent floor reflected it, and as she walked down the hal way, Claire had an absurd feeling she was swimming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hal way opened into a wide chamber, the transparent floor replaced by grey marble. Pale blue and grey couches lined the wal s. Two men and three women sat on the couch cushions. Her shield didn\u0027t permit her to actively scan their minds, but it didn\u0027t prevent her from listening to their psychic emissions. She was open to any signal, like a satel ite dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman on the right, with purple streaks in her black hair, had a loud mind, powerful, but untrained. all her thoughts floated around her like noise above a spaceport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn easy target. The woman on the left was more restrained, but weak. Of the three men, two were trained psychers, but both were mediocre. She had more training by the time she was fifteen. The final man showed no psychic activity at all , his mind practical y invisible. On Uley, he would be a dud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere the term was drone, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tal middle-aged woman in an artful y draped, deep red dress stepped through the arched doorway at the end of the room. She was carrying a tablet. The woman looked her over, her gaze precise like the beam of a bio scanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire Shannon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman stared at her with brown eyes. Her mind sliced through Claire\u0027s surface thoughts with a laser precision and fell short of the shel . That was the beauty of mirroring surface thoughts over the shel - nobody realized the shields were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take this,\" the woman said, handing her the tablet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are three tests loaded on the tablet. Sit down and complete them. You will be cal ed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInwardly Claire exhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rokero Grenali,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older of the men rose and approached her. They disappeared through the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire sat. The polished wal presented her with her own reflection: a severe grey skirt that clasped her narrow waist, a conservative pale blouse, dul brownish hair pul ed away from her face. Of the three changes of clothes she was permitted to bring, this was the best, most feminine outfit she owned. She could count on her fingers occasions when she had worn civilian clothes in the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two women were looking at her. One wore a slick silvery business suit, the other a vivid red and orange dress. Their minds betrayed their reactions: pity tinged with superiority. They felt prettier. They were bright dahlia blossoms, and she was a drab mouse. They dismissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt. It hurt and stung her pride. The emotions boiled inside and bounced off her inner shields. Her face, reflected in the polished wal , was calm. The outer surface of her mind was col ected. Nothing showed except for the mild anxiety, typical to any job applicant. She had too much discipline to let any emotion seep through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shouldn\u0027t have been this unsettled. First the anxiety from the landing, then tests, the echoes of PPP stil humming through her skul , and now the realization that she stood out after a lifetime of being told to how important it was to perfectly fit in. She attracted too much attention. all those factors shredded her normal poise to tatters. It\u0027s the sensory overload, she told herself. It will be fine. She had over eight hundred combat missions behind her. This was just one more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire slid a stylus from its holder on the side of the tablet and scanned the tests. A written and mathematical proficiency, a psychological questionnaire, and a card test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe virtual deck contained fifty-two cards in two sets, one red, one black. Each card bore a single symbol: a circle, a triangle, a diamond, or a long narrow rectangle. The program dealt cards face down and the user had to indicate color and shape. It was the simplest of psychic tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to make sure she failed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shannon,\" the woman cal ed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire stood up and crossed the now empty hal to the woman in red. She was the last applicant of the day. Her chances of being hired had shrunk to miniscule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Lienne,\" the woman informed her. \"Fol ow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crossed through another dark hal . Claire braced herself. Whoever waited for her would scour her mind. Her shields had to hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered a large room. To the left, a floor to ceiling window showed the view of the diagrid envelope, the light streaming through the solar panels now the deep honey of late afternoon. Three plush crescent-shaped couches formed a ring in the middle of the room with a cream-colored coffee table made of reflective plasti-glass in the center. Further, a crescent desk of the same material curved from the wal , on which a large screen hung, streaming some sort of data. A tal blond man stood with his back to her. He turned at their approach and Claire almost stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a strong, masculine face, with a square clean-shaven jaw. On Uley, blond people had a washed out, sickly look, their skin too white, their hair verging on transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was flawless bronze, his hair a pale, almost white gold. His broad shoulders strained the fabric of his tailored light-grey summer doublet, the outline of muscle on his chest and arms plainly visible under the thin fabric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything about him, from the way he turned, graceful and perfectly balanced, to the way he held himself now, communicated health, strength, and power. He was sun-kissed, golden, overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark green eyes focused on her, reflecting a sharp, perceptive intel ect. The eyes of a man who could be either very generous or completely ruthless. The man smiled, at once charming and reassuring, and she felt the power of his mind. It was like a typhoon held back, enclosed in a self-imposed cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too much. Every coping mechanism that let her make it this far col apsed. She stared with no idea how to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was larger than life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLienne cleared her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound shattered her trance. Claire closed her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Claire,\" the man said, his voice resonant, communicating strength as much as his body did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" she answered, reeling from the shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Venturo Escana,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Escana kinsman family, a distant part of her mind informed her. They owned Guardian, Inc., and Venturo Escana led the family. She was facing the god of this beautiful building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my aunt Lienne Escana; she is my second in command. Please sit down,\" he invited her to the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat on autopilot, smoothing her skirt over her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt so out of place here, in this office. Venturo sat across from her. Lienne sat on the same couch as he, leaving several feet between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a refugee,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t sit there, mute, and simply stare. Claire forced herself to formulate words. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I understand, our planet made an arrangement with your home world. We agreed to accept a certain number of refugees in return for the use of Uley\u0027s interstel ar bases as refuel points. I understand your home world made these arrangements with a number of other planets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct,\" she said. He was keeping his mind firmly away from hers. It was an exquisitely polite gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had expected him to batter her the moment she entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must\u0027ve been very difficult to leave your world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea. \"I\u0027ve been very fortunate to arrive here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it here?\" he asked with genuine interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very beautiful,\" she said. \"Very bright.\" Too bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo vivid. Too many smiles. Men that were... that were...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We try to live life to its ful est,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t intend anything sexual by it, but inside her shields, his words triggered an image of him naked. It flashed before her, stunning in its shamelessness. She wanted to touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m losing my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose we have to begin the interview now,\" he said, almost apologetic. \"It\u0027s important that you answer with complete honesty. Lienne and I are monitoring your thoughts. We will be able to detect a lie.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/silver-shark-kinsmen-2/page-4.html","bookId":1587,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:19:44 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:19:44 AM"}
