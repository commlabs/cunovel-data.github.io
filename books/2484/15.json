The Sheriff had the keys and he was the first one down when those…those…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zombies,\" Eric offered helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean looked at him and Eric could see the disbelief in his eyes at the sound of the word despite all he had seen. Slowly, he nodded. \"Yeah, zombies. The soldiers from the crash and some of the rescue guys were mauled by one of the…we thought he was just crazed from his injuries…one of the survivors of the crash. They were being treated in the main room of the community center and the Sheriff was questioning the pilot when suddenly one of the soldiers just got up off his bunk and bit into the Sheriff’s face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey grimaced at the memory and checked the wound. It was still bleeding. \"It went bad fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real fast,\" Sean agreed. \"About half those wounded guys started getting up and attacking people and those people started attacking people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we were trying to get out but the doors were chained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So my Dad and another guy started herding everyone toward the doors to the office area. It was a mad crush and…\" Stacey faltered. She shrugged and continued to press down hard on her flinching brother\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many got into the office area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-three,\" Sean answered softly. His dark eyes glittered with tears. \"Two died of wounds and…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got up. Coop bashed their brains in with a fire extinguisher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your dad?\" Eric swallowed hard thinking of the strong older man who had sacrificed himself at the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Everyone, even us, called him Coop. He\u0027s the town football hero and the coach of the Blazing Riders high school football team,\" Stacey answered. \"Or…he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He gave his life for us to get away,\" Sean said to his sister and laid his hand over hers. \"He held them off on the stairs so I could get up to the fire slide. He was brave until the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Stacey blinked and tears fell down her dirty cheeks. \"I know. But I\u0027d rather have him here than gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean nodded and was unashamed of his own tears. “He just wanted us to live.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked down at Pepe who was sniffing around the edge of the trailer. \"I…lost someone, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, we lost the whole damn town we grew up in,\" Stacey answered him pointedly and gave him a hard look. \"The whole damn town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother reached out to calm her and she sniffled loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric felt sickened by his own selfishness and sat down on the edge of the trailer. \"I\u0027m sorry. I am.” He looked at her apologetically. “I know seeing so many die is horrible and…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey shook her head. “I’m sorry. I have no right to snap at you. We’ve all lost so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric let out a slow breath. “I didn\u0027t know anyone was alive in the community center. If I had known, I would have tried to rescue you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you know we were there?\" Sean shook his head. \"Don\u0027t feel guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did it all go wrong?\" Eric stared at his dirty fingers and tried not to think too hard about Brandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first night we were in there, believe it or not. The Sheriff rounded up everyone that had not left town into the community center,\" Stacey answered. \"But the wounded got up and started eating us up like we were a buffet. And like Sean said, we barricaded ourselves into the offices, lived off the vending machine and the lunches the staff had brought and put in the refrigerator in the lunch room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coop…our dad…kept trying to get us out, but the Sheriff had us locked in real good. All these heavy damn storm doors chained shut. Super thick windows… We started on one of the windows and it took forever to chip through that stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Built during the cold war. I think they thought it was A-bomb proof.\" Stacey rolled her eyes. She peeked at Sean\u0027s arm and looked satisfied. Reaching out for the First Aid kit, she gave Eric a slight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt she was trying to apologize for earlier and he smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were almost through when those things finally broke through our barricade. We locked ourselves in the office where we were busting out the window and it was a race to get the glass broken out in time. Once the opening was big enough, we started evacuating. The plan had been to go to the high school and get into a school bus, but it was just a crazed scramble at the end.\" Sean winced and made a terrible face as his sister began to dress his wounded arm. The deeper wound was no longer trickling blood and the smaller wounds seemed to be closing. \"The football players tried to hold the door shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric flashed back on the mad pursuit up the hill. The fastest of the undead had seemed very fresh and looked like football players. \"Oh. Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We evacuated the old people, the women and the kids first. But those things got in and were already…\" Sean lowered his head and rubbed his eyes. \"They were…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coop realized what was happening and shoved me out the window. Sean was trying to help and our dad told him to get out just as a bunch of them busted in through the damn wall! Some add on modern wall made of cheap materials. Their weight must have done it in.\" Stacey\u0027s hands were a shaking as she slowly wrapped her brother\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad and I were the last ones out. Some of them grabbed for me and I did this crazy dive out the window and fucked up my arm.\" Sean shook his head. \"We got outside and Coop was trying to get everyone rallied together when those fast ones started coming out the window after us. Coop shouted for everyone to run. And those still alive…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ran,\" Stacey said in a tremulous voice. \"We ran. But they ran us down. The fast ones. The new ones. The ran down the old folks, the kids…the…the…\" Stacey let out a strangled sob and turned away from Eric and Sean. Her shoulders trembled and she sniffled loudly as she tried to regain her composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean reached out to stroke her back gently. \"It just…we tried…there was really nothing to use as a weapon. I tried to shove a few of them off this one…kid.\" He shook his head as more tears flowed. \"Coop always made me and Stacey run with him every night. We used to do sprints for fun. He got us into marathon running. Hell, Stacey was a college track star. That\u0027s the only reason we were able to keep ahead,\" Sean looked at Eric with a tormented look on his face. \"But we couldn\u0027t do anything for the rest. We just ran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coop told us to run to Mrs. Waskom\u0027s place. So we did. Then we saw you,\" Stacey began to run her hands lightly down her brother\u0027s leg he had hurt leaping from the window. \"And you pretty much know the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about Coop,\" Eric said in a low voice. \"He seemed so strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was,\" Stacey said in a steadier voice. \"He was the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean winced and let out a small cry as his sister\u0027s hands examined his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m guessing a couple of fractures. Which you probably fucked up more by that crazy sprint,\" Stacey lightly chided Sean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but I’m here, ain’t I?\" Sean grinned then grimaced again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Pepe\u0027s head shot up and his ears perked. He let out a tentative \"woof\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think its time to go,\" Eric said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey nodded and shoved the First Aid kit back under the tarp. \"Sean, you hold on tight,\" Stacey ordered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn bossy twin sister,\" Sean grumbled. \"Just cause you were born first by two minutes…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric could tell it was an old argument, said in love, and Stacey seemed to relax a little at her brother\u0027s teasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA human howl of hunger sounded down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re following,\" Eric said and swept his growling dog into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit,\" Stacey cursed and climbed onto the ATV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric quickly got on and felt her arms come around his waist as he shoved Pepe back into his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys! Hurry it up!\" Sean shouted as down below several of the faster things broke into view. \"Seriously, let’s go. Those things bite hard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric shifted gears and the ATV roared louder and sped down the other side of the hill toward the county road in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" Stacey\u0027s voice was close to his ear and he could feel her body pressing against his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A construction site in Ashley Oaks is being built into a fort. They said they planned a safe way to approach it and I\u0027m gonna try and find it.\" Eric looked into the rearview mirror and saw the bloodied dead following them down the hill. \"Dammit. Those guys do not give up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey looked back over her shoulder and her arms tightened around him. \"Just keep going. At the rate their going they\u0027re going to blow their joints at some point. That\u0027ll slow them down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me,\" Eric said in a resolute tone. \"I\u0027m not stopping until we\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or out of gas,\" Stacey added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got spare gasoline in the trailer,\" Eric assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was silent for a few minutes and he felt her head rest on his shoulder again. Finally, her voice said, \"Coop liked to be well-prepared. He would have liked you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/as-the-world-dies-untold-tales-volume-1/page-15.html","bookId":2484,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:14 PM"}
