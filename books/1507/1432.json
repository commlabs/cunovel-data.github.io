If there were someone capable of seeing everything beneath the surface of that first land mass, they would see that within the long tunnel, there were four stone chambers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was currently heading upward through the tunnel toward the surface of the lands, and at the same time, he was rapidly approaching the fourth stone chamber, which was also the final chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were bloodshot, and he moved at incredible speed. Countless thoughts and ideas ran through his head, and they grew increasingly disorderly. He was getting even more anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome days later, the fourth stone chamber appeared up ahead of him. He slowed down, coming to a stop just outside the chamber. He stood there quietly for a long moment, taking the time to calm his mind and heart. Then, he stepped into the chamber, eyes glittering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe absolutely had to see what the frescoes in this fourth chamber depicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he stepped into the chamber and looked at the frescoes, his vision swam. When things became clear, he was looking at pitch blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was completely and utterly black, without even a glimmer of light. It didn’t feel like an infinite blackness that stretched out endlessly. Rather, it was like an obstacle, blocking the way ahead, almost like... the end of the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin that darkness, he saw four pillars that seemed to prop up the world. Emanating out from the pillars to spread out in all directions were shocking fluctuations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw the pillars, he suddenly realized something, and began to pant. He spun, and was shocked to find that behind him was... an enormous maelstrom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maelstrom was so gargantuan that at first glance it looked like a huge sphere. However, closer examination revealed that the maelstrom was actually made up of endless clouds and mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he looked at the spherical maelstrom, he even noticed some places which looked familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m outside... the Vast Expanse....” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a desire rose up within him. He focused on one particular area of the maelstrom, and his vision zoomed in, passing through layers upon layers of mist before coming to rest on an area within the Vast Expanse that was rife with an aura of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vortex could be seen there, spinning slowly. As Meng Hao looked at it, he saw... an area that was tattered and torn, filled with corpses, ruin, wreckage, and ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Mountain and Sea Realm....” he thought, heart stabbing with pain. It was the former location of the Mountain and Sea Realm. But everything that had happened there was nothing more than the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment passed, Meng Hao looked away. Following the tuggings of his heart, his gaze passed in another direction, to a location where a powerful sealing magic was located. A monkey sat cross-legged outside of it, completely oblivious to Meng Hao’s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the monkey were... numerous land masses, thirty-three in total. They were the 33 Heavens, like thirty-three walls, beneath which was a vortex. Inside the vortex was a green coffin, upon which rested a butterfly, whose wings floated gently up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he laid eyes on the butterfly, his heart thumped. He could just barely make out his father and mother there, nestled in each other\u0027s arms. His vision zoomed in again, and next he saw a world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many familiar faces in that world. His sister, Sun Hai, and Fatty....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one particular mountain, he saw a thin woman who was Xu Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to see more, but inwardly, exhaustion was taking root. His vision swam, and then zoomed back out, as if he were being expelled from the starry sky of the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last moments before his vision completely faded away, he suddenly looked over at the Vast Expanse School. There, outside of Planet Vast Expanse, was an area where the starry sky was damaged and in ruins. There was no Vast Expanse mist there, only a rift. After looking into that rift, he saw nine land masses that formed into a necropolis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was unable to see himself in the stone chamber in the first land mass, but he was able to see a scattered group of people. There was the Sect Leader, the golden-robed young man, the sand-wreathed figure, the Sixth and Eighth Paragons, and all the others....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see that in the very center of the first land mass, where the Sect Leader was currently located, was an altar which emanated a unique aura that resembled Transcendence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was left reeling as his consciousness and sight returned to their original location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath as he looked at the spherical maelstrom again. Then, mind spinning, he turned once more to look at the four astonishing pillars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew exactly what those four pillars were. He had seen them in the vision from the second set of frescoes. They were the four fingers left behind by Allheaven after his death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the vision from the third set of frescoes, he had seen one of those fingers destroy a thriving world and kill all of the lives within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I am outside the Vast Expanse, and this spherical maelstrom is the Vast Expanse, within which I exist.” Panting, Meng Hao suddenly thought about something he knew which apparently conflicted with what he was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Vast Expanse School is a branch of the Vast Expanse Society, which exists on the outside. The Ninth Paragon even came from there. But if I am outside the Vast Expanse right now, then where is the Vast Expanse Society...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I\u0027m in a different time...? But then why would I be able to see the Mountain and Sea Butterfly, and everything else in the Vast Expanse?” Meng Hao frowned. He wanted to get closer to the four pillars, to study them, but when he tried to move, everything turned blurry. After things got clear again, he wasn’t near the four pillars, but back in the fourth stone chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, the bronze lamp inside of him quieted down. The sense of being called faded away, as if what had been reaching out to the bronze lamp was none other than this fourth set of frescoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he had laid eyes on it, the bronze lamp became calm once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you really are Patriarch Vast Expanse, then the message you wished to pass on to me by leaving these frescoes... has been received.” After a moment, Meng Hao clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he had experienced the visions within the frescoes, he was filled with a deep skepticism regarding the Immortal Gods, the Devil Realm, the Vast Expanse, and the destruction of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a name he would not be forgetting. Allheaven!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was that saying, ‘Allheaven fears the Immortal!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao took a deep breath and rose to his feet. After closing his eyes, he calmed himself, then took the skepticism, the doubts and the misgivings, and tucked them away deep inside his heart. When he opened his eyes, they seemed just like they had been before he had experienced the visions. With that, he left the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProceeding along, he soon reached the end of the tunnel, where a staircase led up to ground level. As he emerged, he looked around to find ruins stretching out around him in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on the outer edge of the first land mass, an area filled with broken buildings and ruined structures. Everything was quiet, except for a whispering breeze which occasionally picked up the dust and carried it off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore experiencing the visions, Meng Hao’s third eye had enabled him to see the Ghost City as it was in the present. But now, after having seen it when it was flourishing and alive, looking around at what remained of it caused him to sigh. Subconsciously, he looked up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That finger descended from above. One finger... wiped out all life here.” As Meng Hao stood there quietly, he realized how insignificant he was, and at the same time, was as focused and determined as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another moment passed, Meng Hao turned, transforming into a beam of light that shot at high speed across the surface of the land mass. This location was no longer unfamiliar to him; after seeing this world in his vision, he had come to know it well, as well as where the others were located within it. In fact, after looking at the ruins and the mountains around him, he quickly determined his exact location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Sect Leader and the others are at the altar in the center of the land mass. Apparently... that is their target destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The aura of Transcendence....” As he flew along, his eyes glittered coldly, and he turned to look toward the east. “I remember that the Sixth Paragon was in that area. He shouldn\u0027t be very far off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnorting coldly, he changed directions to head toward the location of the Sixth Paragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was not the type of person who enjoyed living for hatred and revenge. However, the Sixth Paragon had provoked him three times, and the last time had been with killing intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, Meng Hao would kill him, along with the Eighth Paragon and... the golden-robed young man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a decision he made without the slightest hesitation or misgiving. After experiencing the visions he just had, he seemed calm on the inside, but was actually deeply anxious. That anxiety in turn unleashed a deep skepticism within him, something that stemmed from his guilt over the destruction of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat skepticism and that anxiety filled him with the desire to kill!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, the Sixth Paragon was one of the targets on his list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao shot through the air like lightning, doing nothing to mask his aura. His cultivation base surged with power, becoming a raging tempest that formed into a face. It was a ferocious semblance of his own by about seventy percent. However, this face had a horn protruding from its forehead, and appeared to be as cold as ice. It was brutal, and shockingly Demonic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, the Sixth Paragon was traveling through the ruins with his sole surviving subordinate, an 8-Essences Paragon. He was heading toward the central altar, but was simultaneously searching for other good fortune. Suddenly, his face fell, and he looked up to see the shocking face that resembled Meng Hao’s speeding toward him, bursting with a murderous aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, you’re actually not dead!!” His face fell as he sensed the killing intent coming from Meng Hao. His scalp tingled as he thought of the madness with which Meng Hao fought. Gasping, and without the slightest hesitation, he pulled out a jade slip to contact the golden-robed young man and the Eighth Paragon. Then he turned, leaving behind afterimages as he went all-out in an attempt to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the Sixth Paragon fled, Meng Hao\u0027s voice echoed out like thunder behind him, “You brought this upon yourself, old man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1428\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1430\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1429","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
