He was terribly mortified to have it known that he had been forced into such a business. If Tom had nothing worse to be ashamed of he need not have blushed, but he was suffering from false shame. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When did you come to the city?” he stammered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Only this morning.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you are surprised to see me in this business,” said Tom, awkwardly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There is nothing to be ashamed of,” said Grant. “It is an honest business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s an awful come down for me,” said Tom, uncomfortably. “The fact is, I\u0027ve had hard luck.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sorry to hear that,” said Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I expected a place in Wall Street, but I came just too late, and things are awful dull anyway. Then I was robbed of my money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much?” asked Grant, curiously, for he didn\u0027t believe a word of it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Eight dollars and thirty-three cents,” replied Tom, glibly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought you were too smart to be robbed,” said Grant, slyly. “If it had been a green boy from the country like me, now, it wouldn\u0027t have been surprising.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I was asleep when I was robbed,” explained Tom, hurriedly. “A fellow got into my room in the night, and picked my pocket. I couldn\u0027t help that, now, could I?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose not.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I had to get something to do, or go back to Colebrook. I say, Grant—-”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t you tell any of the fellers at home what business I\u0027m in, that\u0027s a good fellow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I won\u0027t if you don\u0027t want me to,” said Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You see, it\u0027s only a few days till I can get something else to do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s a great deal better blacking boots than being idle, in my opinion,” said Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s the way I look at it. But you didn\u0027t tell me what you came to the city for?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m coming here for good,” announced Grant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You haven\u0027t got a place, have you?” ejaculated Tom, in surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I am to enter the office of Mr. Reynolds, a stock broker. There is his sign.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t say so I. Why, that\u0027s just the sort of place I wanted. How did you get the chance?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I got acquainted with Mr. Reynolds on board the cars that day we came to New York together.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you asked him for the place?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I asked him this morning.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You might have given me the chance,” grumbled Tom, enviously. “You knew it was the sort of place I was after.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t think I was called upon to do that,” said Grant, smiling. “Besides, he wouldn\u0027t have accepted you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why not? Ain\u0027t I as smart as you, I\u0027d like to know?” retorted Tom Calder, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He heard us talking in the cars, and didn\u0027t like what you said.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What did I say?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He doesn\u0027t approve of boys smoking cigarettes and going to bucket shops. You spoke of both.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How did he hear?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He was sitting just behind us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was it that old chap that was sittin\u0027 with you when I came back from the smoking car?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just my luck,” said Tom, ruefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When are you goin\u0027 to work?” asked Tom, after a pause.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Next Monday.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where are you going to board? We might take a room together, you know. It would be kind of social, as we both come from the same place.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It did not occur to Grant that the arrangement would suit him at all, but he did not think it necessary to say so. He only said: “I am going to Mr. Reynolds\u0027 house, just at first.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t say so! Why, he\u0027s taken a regular fancy to you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If he has, I hope he won\u0027t get over it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose he lives in a handsome brownstone house uptown.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very likely; I\u0027ve never seen the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, some folks has luck, but I ain\u0027t one of \u0027em,” grumbled Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your luck is coming, I hope, Tom.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish it would come pretty soon, then; I say, suppose your folks won\u0027t let you take the place?” he asked, suddenly, brightening up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They won\u0027t oppose it.” “I thought they wanted you to go to college.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can\u0027t afford it. It would take too long before I could earn anything, and I ought to be helping the family.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m goin\u0027 to look out for number one,” said Tom, shrugging his shoulders. “That\u0027s all I can do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tom\u0027s mother was a hard-working woman, and had taken in washing for years. But for her the family would often have lacked for food. His father was a lazy, intemperate man, who had no pride of manhood, and cared only for himself. In this respect Tom was like him, though the son had not as yet become intemperate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t think there is any chance of my giving up the place,” answered Grant. “If I do, I will mention your name.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s a good fellow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant did not volunteer to recommend Tom, for he could not have done so with a clear conscience. This omission, however, Tom did not notice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Tom, I must be going. Good-by, and good luck.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant went home with a cheerful face, and announced his good luck to his mother.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am glad you are going to your employer\u0027s house,” she said. “I wish you could remain there permanently.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So do I, mother; but I hope at any rate to get a comfortable boarding place. Tom Calder wants to room with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope you won\u0027t think of it,” said Mrs. Thornton, alarmed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not for a moment. I wish Tom well, but I shouldn\u0027t like to be too intimate with him. And now, mother, I think I ought to write to Uncle Godfrey, and tell him what I have decided upon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That will be proper, Grant.” Grant wrote the following letter, and mailed it at once:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “DEAR UNCLE GODFREY:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am afraid you won\u0027t like what I have to tell you, but I think it is my duty to the family to give up the college course you so kindly offered me, in view of father\u0027s small salary and narrow means. I have been offered a place in the office of a stock broker in New York, and have accepted it. I enter upon my duties next Monday morning. I hope to come near paying my own way, and before very long to help father. I know you will be disappointed, Uncle Godfrey, and I hope you won\u0027t think I don\u0027t appreciate your kind offer, but I think it would be selfish in me to accept it. Please do forgive me, and believe me to be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Your affectionate nephew, GRANT THORNTON.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In twenty-four hours an answer came to this letter. It ran thus:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “NEPHEW GRANT:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I would not have believed you would act so foolishly and ungratefully. It is not often that such an offer as mine is made to a boy. I did think you were sensible enough to understand the advantages of a professional education. I hoped you would do credit to the name of Thornton, and keep up the family reputation as a man of learning and a gentleman. But you have a foolish fancy for going into a broker\u0027s office, and I suppose you must be gratified. But you needn\u0027t think I will renew my offer. I wash my hands of you from this time forth, and leave you to your own foolish course. The time will come when you will see your folly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n GODFREY THORNTON.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grant sighed as he finished reading this missive. He felt that his uncle had done him injustice. It was no foolish fancy, but a conscientious sense of duty, which had led him to sacrifice his educational prospects.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On Monday morning he took the earliest train for New York.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82008.html","bookId":347,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:13:44 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:13:44 AM"}
