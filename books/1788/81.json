You traveled all night. It may take a long tune to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No it won\u0027t.\" His eyes glinted with irony. \"Your brother is hardly one to cover his tracks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately six hours after his search for Leo had begun, Cam knocked at the front door of a prosperous manor farm. A piece of tavern gossip had led to someone who had seen Ramsay with someone else, and they had gone to another place, where their plans had been overheard, and so forth, until finally the trait had led to this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large Tudor house, with the date 1620 inscribed over the door, was located almost ten miles from Stony Cross Park. From the information Cam had gathered, the farm had once belonged to a noble Hampshire family, but had been sold out of necessity to a London merchant. It served as a retreat for the merchant\u0027s dissipated sons and their playmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly a surprise that Leo had been drawn to such company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was opened, and a trout-faced butler appeared. His lips twisted disdainfully as he saw Cam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your kind isn\u0027t welcome here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fortunate, since I don\u0027t intend to stay long. I\u0027ve come to collect Lord Ramsay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no Ramsay here.\" The butler began to close the door, but Cam braced a hand on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tall. Light eyes. Ruddy-complexioned. Probably reeking of spirits?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen no one of that description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me speak to your master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is not al home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Cam said irritably, \"I\u0027m here on behalf of Lord Ramsay\u0027s family. They want him back. God knows why. Give him to me, and I\u0027ll leave you in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they want him,\" the butler said frostily, \"let them send a proper servant. Not a filthy Gypsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam rubbed the corners of his eyes with his free hand and sighed. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Frankly, I\u0027d rather not go through unnecessary exertion. All I ask is that you allow me five minutes to find the bastard and take him off your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Begone with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another foiled attempt to close the door, the butler reached for a silver bell on the hall table. A few seconds later, two burly footmen appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show this vermin out at once,\" the butler commanded. Cam removed his coat and tossed it onto one of the built-in benches lining the entrance hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first footman charged him. In a few practiced movements, Cam landed a right cross on his jaw, flipped him, and sent him to a groaning heap on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second footman approached Cam with considerably more caution than the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is your dominant arm?\" Cam asked. The footman looked startled. \"Why do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d prefer to break the one you don\u0027t use as often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footman\u0027s eyes bulged, and he retreated, giving the butler a pleading glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler glared at Cam. \"You have five minutes. Retrieve your master and go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ramsay isn\u0027t my master,\" Cam muttered. \"He\u0027s a pain in my arse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027ve been in the same room for days,\" the footman, whose name was George, told Cam as they ascended a flight of carpeted stairs. \"Food sent in, whores coming and going, empty wine bottles everywhere... and the stench of opium smoke all through the entire upper floor. You\u0027ll want to cover your eyes when you enter the room, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the smoke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, and?well, the goings-on would make the devil blush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m from London,\" Cam said. \"I don\u0027t blush.\" Even if George hadn\u0027t been willing to lead Cam to the room of iniquity, he could have easily found it from the smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was ajar. Cam nudged it open and stepped into the hazy atmosphere. There were four men and two women, all young, all in various stages of undress. Although only one opium pipe was in evidence, it could have been argued that the entire room served as a huge pipe, so thick was the sweet smoke. Cam\u0027s arrival was greeted with remarkable unconcern, the men listlessly draped across upholstered furniture, one coiled on cushions in the corner. Their complexions were cadaverous, their eyes filmy with narcotic dullness. A side table was littered with spoons and pins and a dish filled with what looked like black treacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the women, who was entirely naked, paused in the act of lifting a pipe to a man\u0027s slack mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" she said to the other woman, \"here\u0027s a new one.\" A drowsy giggle. \"Good, we need him. They\u0027re all at half-mast. The only stiff thing left is the pipe.\" She twisted to look at Cam. \"Gor, what a pretty man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, let me have him first,\" the other one said. She petted herself invitingly. \"C\u0027mere, love, I\u0027ll give you a?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\" Cam was beginning to feel slightly dizzy from the smoke. He went to the nearest window, opened it, and let a cold breeze into the room. A few curses and protests greeted his actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdentifying the one in the corner as Leo, Cam went to the quiescent figure, lifted the head by the hair, and stared into his future brother-in-law\u0027s puffy face. \"Haven\u0027t you inhaled enough smoke lately?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo scowled. \"Sod off\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like Merripen,\" Cam said. \"Who, in case you\u0027re interested, may be dead by the time we return to Stony Cross Manor.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-81.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
