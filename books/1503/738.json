Such a massive gathering of power, even if they were to take on the Terror Sea Dragon head-on, though they would never be able to win, they would be able to hold it off for some time.

In that instant, its entire body seemed to become transparent, somehow turning into a bluish crystalline state. This was its method of pushing its cultivation to the maximum. With its Heavenly God state of power, even without the aid of the ocean, its power was not to be underestimated.

With the Terror Sea Dragon going berserk and going all out in a desperate fight, even though the Tenebrous Sealing Formation giving the two of them an absolute advantage, both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon could not possibly kill it in such a short period of time. Naturally, with this advantage, given enough time they could easily drag it to death. Without replenishment from atmospheric energies, its berserk fighting style would never be able to last for a long period of time. Alas, since it had chosen this method of fighting, it definitely had no fear and was likely emboldened by its incoming companion! No matter Dreamwake, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, or the other Xuantian powerhouses, they couldn’t help but feel a vague sense of unease.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe power fluctuations in the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was extremely violent, and each exchange of blows caused a strong shockwave that resulted in the twelve pillars of black light also shuddering.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the end, it was Zhou Weiqing who was entirely outside of the formation that was now the most comfortable.

When he looked closer, Zhou Weiqing realised that was not any shoreline, but an immense wave that seemed to reach the skies! Outside of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, his senses were once again heightened to the max, and he could clearly feel a terrifying pressure appear once more. Although it was slightly weaker as compared to the first appearance of the Terror Sea Dragon, since there also wasn’t the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s aura to help counter it, Zhou Weiqing felt as if the new, powerful aura was pressuring so hard that he could barely breathe.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf it were any other time, even if it was today before he witnessed the fight, perhaps Zhou Weiqing’s judgement would be slightly inaccurate.

Without the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, the trapped one would even recover its full power; even though it was already injured, both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had expended a lot of energy to deal those injuries.
