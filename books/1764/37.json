But it’s no use. Maybe the prince and princess have never had a hostage before, but they tie knots with precision, and the more we struggle, the tighter the restraints become. Pen finally gives up when I begin to bleed, and instead she helps me draw my knees to my chest, making me small enough to loop my arms under me until my hands are in my lap. For the first time I see the damage to my skin, swollen and red and oozing. Probably infected. Basil would be angry to see what they’ve done to me. Angry like when he found out about Ms. Harlan prodding into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s so careful with me, always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I return to him, he’ll pull me into his arms. Sweep me up. I’ll close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his chest against mine. Feel his breath on my neck. My skin swells with little bumps. And then the memory of him is gone. I said that I wouldn’t kill them, but I know that I would. To return to him, I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the seventh chime in the evening, Pen and I make the difficult decision to blow out the candle. We’ll hide on opposite sides of the door and we’ll use the darkness to ambush the prince and princess when they bring us a new candle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen stands by the flickering light, staring into the flame before smiling at me. “One last look before it’s lights-out,” she says. “If this goes wrong, we’ll never get a good look at each other again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my eyes. “You always know what to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m standing by the door, arms out to help guide her back to me in the blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really are a beautiful girl,” she tells me. “I never tell you that. I’m always fussing about your hair and things. But you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the blush burning across my cheeks. “You too,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a deep breath, exhales, and we’re in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe settle on opposite sides of the door, and I press my back to the wall. My heart is pounding and I feel myself shuddering with it. This isn’t real darkness. This is unnatural, devoid of clean air and stars. The moon wouldn’t be able to find us here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t talk for the longest time, listening, waiting, knowing it could be hours before it’s time to strike. The clock strikes eight. Then later, nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a strange rustling sound, like stone grinding against stone. It startles me before I realize the sound is coming from Pen, not the stairwell. “What are you doing?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I heard—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh!” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a noise from the other side of the door. Whispers. A little laugh. Faint gold threads of light appear through the wooden door. I hear the locks being unlatched, and just as Pen and I planned, I scoot away from the door so that I’ll still be in the shadows when the prince and princess step inside. The plan is to startle them and try to knock them down, then rush outside and lock them in. I’ve gone over and over it for what has surely been hours, hoping it will be as easy as it seems in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door creaks open, and Princess Celeste and Prince Azure cease their whispering when they realize we aren’t on the floor where they left us. The prince holds the candle up, and he doesn’t see that Pen is behind him. The princess does, though, and she draws a breath to speak, and I know it’s time. I spring forward and hook my arms around her, pin her against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggles wildly, but the twine that binds my wrists is keeping her in place. “No.” Her voice is desperate. “Please, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not going to hurt her. I’m just about to tell her that, when I realize she isn’t paying me any mind—the words are for Pen, whose eyes are dangerous in the candlelight. She’s got something in her hands and she’s raising it above the prince’s head, and now I understand what that noise was. She discovered that a rather large stone had come loose in the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t!” Princess Celeste and I cry out at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re silenced by the sound of the stone colliding with Prince Azure’s skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crumples, and the candle flies from his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sister explodes into a scream, and both of our bodies shake with it. Panicked, I let her go and she drops to his side. “Azure!” she’s saying. “Az!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next instant her lacy sleeves are red with his blood. He doesn’t move. She lowers her ear to his chest, and her long, long hair wraps over her brother’s still form like a shield. Her braided crown holds firm, as if to insist that she is something great, even on the floor, even like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe candle rolls along the stones, and just as Pen is reaching for it, it goes out, leaving us in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime was our very first king. We all live our lives to the aggressive ticking of the clock. We don’t question that our lives are a grid of seconds; even our pulses oblige. No succeeding king can hope to hold this kind of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—“Intangible Gods,” Daphne Leander, Year Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEN PUSHES ME THROUGH THE DOOR. I CAN’T see a thing, and I rush to keep up with her. We pick a direction that I think will take us toward the water room, and we run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe princess is screaming and screaming. The stairwell is alive with footsteps. We stop and spin around to see the candlelight coming toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe crouch behind a crumbling slab of wall, likely the remains of an old prison cell, and force ourselves to quiet our gasping. My lungs burn. My heart is racing. I’m furious. As Pen presses herself against me, I’m remembering what she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make no promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where we’re perched, I can see the patrolmen rushing to the prince’s aide. I think it’s too late for him. The princess is sobbing that he needs a medic. Moments before she opened the door, she and her brother had been giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the patrolmen leads her to the doorway and grabs her shoulders, trying to get something coherent out of her. “Who did this?” he asks several times before she seems to hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arms are folded and she’s staring at Prince Azure when she swallows and says, “Men. They—they stole us from our beds and dragged us down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men? What did they look like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter; they’ve gone.” She pushes his hands from her shoulders. “The heir to the throne is going to bleed to death if you don’t help him. Do you want that to happen on your watch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurmurs and footsteps. Some of the patrolmen rush upstairs; there are too many of them to count, and my stomach is sick when I realize that Pen planned it this way. A scream from Princess Celeste would summon every patrolman on duty. All we need to do is wait them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedics hurry down from upstairs, carrying a cushioned board for the prince’s body. And there’s someone else, too. King Furlow himself, his thin white hair disheveled, his white robe open, revealing his doughy stomach. To see him in such a state is to see Internment for the soil. He is as ordinary as the rest of us. No greatness to him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know Judas was right—I wouldn’t have been able to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the man who had my parents murdered. But I take no satisfaction from the pain on his face when he sees his son, sees the blood all over his daughter’s white clothes as she chews her lip and trembles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Papa,” she croaks. “Make them help him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are, love, they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows move in the candlelight. Medics are carrying the prince up the stairs on the cushioned board. I can’t tell whether he’s breathing. All I see is that much of the cushion has gone red with blood, drops of it falling out of reach from the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen is trembling beside me. “Morgan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wrists are burning from where the princess’s struggle dug the twine into my wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems the entire tower has gathered here. Except for the queen. There have been rumors that she has taken ill; looking back it does seem strange that she wasn’t in any of the broadcasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the king poisoned her too, I think bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he puts his arm around his daughter to console her, and it’s an echo of my father comforting me when we stood over Lex’s hospital bed, not knowing if he’d pull through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Furlow and Princess Celeste follow the medics up the stairs. Patrolmen escort them on all sides. As they go, they take the candlelight with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clock strikes ten, drowning out the sounds they make. But I can still hear Princess Celeste’s sobs; I suspect I’ll hear them for a very long time in my dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen and I stay huddled in the dark after the last chime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We won’t have long,” I whisper when I’m sure it’s safe. “Let’s try to find a way out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We shouldn’t take the stairs,” Pen says. I can tell by her voice that she’s fighting for calm. I don’t know how long she was planning to attack the prince, but she’s seen it played out and she’s seen the damage she caused, and it’s ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m the first to stand and begin walking. She clings to my shirt hem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morgan?” she whispers. “You understand that I had to, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just hope he isn’t dead,” is all I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t tell on us. She could have. Why didn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” My arms are out in front of me, and I’m feeling along the grimy bricks, hoping for an out. My eyes are trying to adjust to the darkness, but there’s nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, suddenly, there is. A glimmer of moonlight breaking through a wooden door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fumble for the doorknob, and it turns, but the door doesn’t budge. Pen helps me undo the series of locks. It’s taking so long, I feel we’re in a dream where air has been replaced by sweetgold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull the knob again, and the door opens with a creak that I’m sure will summon the patrolmen. But no, they don’t come. They’ll be busy with all that blood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-ruin-the-internment-chronicles-1/page-37.html","bookId":1764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:38 AM"}
