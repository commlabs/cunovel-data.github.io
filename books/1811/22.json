Her wet mouth, the stroke of her soft tongue, the way her cheeks hollowed out when she sucked me dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my memory runs wild, I just barely contain the pu**y-whipped urge to call Delores and implore her to come over. I succeed, but only because we already made plans for her to hang out here Wednesday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as I’m concerned, Wednesday can’t come soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday afternoon, I meet Alexandra downtown for lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weather is mild, so we sit at a sidewalk table outside. I take a bite of my burger while Alexandra crunches a salad with grilled shrimp. Then I tell her, “So . . . I’ve met someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing up with Drew, I always regarded Lexi as my older sister, but the fact that we didn’t share the same genes, or actually have to live together, made our relationship much less contentious than the one she has with her brother. She looks out for me, but she doesn’t “mother” me the way she does with Drew. She gets annoyed by my screwups, but she doesn’t feel responsible for them. For me, it’s the best of both worlds—all the benefits of a big sister without the pain in the ass headaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From what I hear, you and my brother ‘meet’ lots of women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin. “This one I like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. “Once again, you and Drew ‘like’ a whole bunch of poor, unsuspecting ladies. Why is this one worth mentioning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like her, like her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra’s blue eyes widen. “Wow. A Wonder Years reference. This must be serious. Do tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes abashedly drop to my burger. “Her name is Delores.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s kind of random.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s . . . different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi tries to pull more details out of me. “Like . . . she has three br**sts kind of different?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “No. But, for the record, it wouldn’t be a strike against her if she did. She’s . . . cool. I have a good time talking with her, you know? She says she’s not into relationships, but I think I’m hoping I can change her mind. I haven’t felt like this since . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra puts up her palm. “Don’t. Do not even say the foul beast’s name. I’m trying to eat here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, I’m not sure if it’s going anywhere, but I . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t get the opportunity to finish my sentence. Because a wave of icy, red liquid splashes in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTastes like cherry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lying motherfucker!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swipe my face, clearing the fluid off my eyelashes. When my vision clears, I see Delores standing on the sidewalk—with a now-empty Slurpee cup clenched in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich she proceeds to throw at my f**king head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All that talk about not hooking up with other people! Exclusive f**k buddies, you said! I would’ve liked you if you had just been straight with me! I knew it—I knew you were just another false-faced bastard who doesn’t like to share his sex toys but has no problem playing with a different one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, Alexandra and I are both on our feet. And I have no idea what’s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try, “Delores . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she cuts me off. “Four days! You tell me four days ago that you’re not interested in screwing anyone else, and here I find you with . . . with . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi holds out her hand for a shake. “Alexandra Reinhart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee’s incendiary glare turns to Lexi. But her tirade stops as she wonders. “Reinhart. How do I know that name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lets me answer. Finally. “She’s Mackenzie’s mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you look closely, you can almost see our previous conversation replaying in Delores’s eyes. “Mackenzie . . . the pseudo niece?” Her head turns more fully to me. “That means she’s . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The girl I grew up with—yes. Drew’s sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra takes over for me. “Drew’s sister, Steven’s wife, daughter of John and Anne. I have many designations. One, in particular, is about to be put to good use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s times like this I suspect Alexandra knows about her nickname. And it scares me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra’s eyes stay on Dee, but she says to me, “I see what you meant about different.” Then to Delores, “You must be Delores. Matthew was just telling me about you. I’d say it’s a pleasure to meet you, but I’ve reached my bullshit quota for the week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra circles her slowly—like a shark checking out a wounded seal. “You know, Delores, my mother used to tell me that even though a man wasn’t supposed to ever strike a woman, I should never take advantage of that. That I should never act without expecting an equal and deserving reaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee folds her arms across her chest and stands stubbornly tall under the weight of Lexi’s disapproving gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matthew’s explained our relationship to you. He’s like a second brother to me. And of the two of them? He’s the nicer one. You should keep that in mind before you think about tossing Icees at his head again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee gives just a little. She looks down at the sidewalk and mutters defensively, “It was a Slurpee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra snaps her fingers at me. “Give me your shirt and jacket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter taking off my tie, I hand the items to her and stand on the sidewalk in a plain white undershirt and gray slacks. Dee reaches for the stained clothes in Lexi’s hands. “I’ll pay to have them dry-cleaned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra rolls her eyes. “The dry cleaners won’t be able to get this out. Luckily, I have a homemade paste that should save the day.” She says to me, “You can pick it up Saturday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hands on my shoulders and kisses my cheek while wiping some remaining red slush off my ear with a napkin. “I have to get going. Good luck—you’re going to need it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Alexandra leaves, Dee offers, “I hope the next time we meet, it’ll be under better circumstances.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Alexandra responds, “I seriously doubt we’ll be meeting again. Matthew’s sweet, not stupid.” Then she grabs her purse and walks down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee and I watch her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost to herself Dee says, “Is she always that much of a bitch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. “It’s what she does.” Then I run a hand through my sticky, stiff hair. “What the f**k, Dee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arm folding is back, and she babbles, “I’m not apologizing. It was a natural mistake. I told you I’m not good at this. Apparently, I even screw up f**k buddies. I was walking around on my lunch break, and I couldn’t believe it when I saw you. What else was I supposed to think? If you want to blow me off, that’s your decision to make, but I’m not sorry.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tamed-tangled-3/page-22.html","bookId":1811,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:10 PM"}
