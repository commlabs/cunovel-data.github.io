{"id":96116,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eWhat do I wear to meet parents?\" I asked Becky in my bedroom later that day. \"I don\u0027t have a thing! It\u0027s way different than trying to impress a guy. It has to be something striking yet appropriate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello! You have a whole wardrobe that screamsmansionwear !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?You say the kindest things!\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky was stretched out on my bed reading one of her teenmags while I mixed and matched several outfits and modeled them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all look good to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have to look great! This one is too sexy,\" I said, holding a black bodice. \"And this one is too casual,\" I said, holding up a HIM T-shirt. \"How am I going to pull it off? This could make or break my relationship with Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thismag is full of great styles.\" Becky opened to a spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For me?Are the girls modeling tattoos and tongue piercings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. But that doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t help inspire you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander would drop dead if I showed up in a polka-dotted dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give it your spin. If they\u0027re showing stripedKeds sneakers-then choose skull and crossbones Vans \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was great to have a best friend who understood me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the models were beautiful and glowing in their candy-colored outfits. I guess I couldn\u0027t hide my slight jealousy of their perfect bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, everyone can be gorgeous with airbrushing,\" Becky remarked. \"And we are fabulous without it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really expect me to put my hair in a ponytail with plaid ribbon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027d wear pigtails with an uneven part and black lace bows. Or better yet, Wednesday Addams braids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are onto something. Maybe we could start our own magazine.Something where the models dress like me.Gothicgirl!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d buy it, I\u0027d totally not wear anything in it, but I\u0027d buy it,\" Becky assured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be the editor, and we could have articles about music and fashion and we\u0027d interviewCriss Angel,\" I said excitedly. \"And in every issue I could be on the cover-like Oprah, but wearing all black.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Alexander, too,\" Becky added. \"I bet every girl across the country would buy a copy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he couldn\u0027t be on the cover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...\" I almost blurted out the true reason, but I caught myself.\"Because it\u0027s my magazine. Not his. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,He\u0027ll have to get his own.How aboutGQ.Gothic Quarterly\" I said, covering my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awesome! Now that we\u0027ve decided on your career, we need to pick your outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe matched a few outfits together and voted on them until only one was left.A black mini lace dress, black tights with knee-high boots, and a lace bodice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A marriage made in heaven-or in my case, hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you think?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop- dead gorgeous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time I had a dinner date with Alexander I was nervous. Would he like me? Would he ask me out again? Would it end in a passionate kiss?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis dinner would be different. I brushed my hair a thousand times and reapplied my makeup. Was I too pale or not pale enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this date I\u0027d be judged by Alexander\u0027s parents. Would theSterlings think I was a good fit for their son? I knew they had approved of Luna-but I wasn\u0027t Luna. I didn\u0027t come fromRomania or have vampire blood or a vampire family. My whole relationship was riding on this one meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting ready when my mom poked her head into my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, are you excited about your big night?\" my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to downplay its importance and hide the panic attack I was having. \"Sure, it\u0027s no big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is. You are going to meet your boyfriend\u0027s parents!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are supposed to make me feel better-not worse!\" I whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant. I meant it is exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt tears welling. Any minute my eyeliner was going to bleed down to my shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No- it\u0027s a make-it-or-break-it night. I\u0027m not like them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you have to be like them? You are you.\" My mom smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TheSterlings have royal blood. Alexander\u0027s grandmother was a baroness. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve dined with kings, queens, and noblemen. They live in mansions! They are fromRomania . I\u0027m from Dullsville.\" I plopped down on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I relax? You have no idea what it\u0027s like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I do?\" she asked, sitting down next to me. \"Your father and I were both hippies, remember? Our parents were ultraconservative. When I first met Grandma Madison, I was in a tank top and cutoffs. I\u0027m surprised she ever let me in her house again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s normal to be nervous. Think of how Alexander feels. He wants you to like them, too,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he\u0027s anxious, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he is. He probably thinks his parents will embarrass him, just like you think we will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt relieved knowing that I wasn\u0027t carrying the entire burden of our meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure as soon as theSterlings meet you,\" my mom continued, \"they\u0027lllove you like I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to love me; you\u0027re my mother,\" I rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see what you chose to wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? Becky and I already decided on it. I can\u0027t go back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you chose something appropriate. I\u0027ll go downstairs until you\u0027re ready,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI retouched,rebrushed , and fussed until my EdwardScissorhands clock flashed, \"You\u0027re late!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flew down the stairs to find my family hanging out in front of the TV. I modeled my outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t you wear somethingmore.,.conservative ?\" my mother asked. \"How about a pretty knit sweater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored my mother\u0027s remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look wonderful,\" my dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she looks awesome,\" I heard Henry say to Billy Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to hurl,\" my brother retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged my parents exceptionally hard. I was going to be dining with adult vampires. Who knows-I might lever come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later our doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too nervous to answer, so Billy Boy opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment,\" he said in his politest voice. \"Raven- it\u0027s for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and started for the door. Jameson stood before me, complete in his butler\u0027s uniform and gloves. \"Miss Raven, your car awaits you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom winked and my dad gave me a thumbs-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jameson and I walked down the driveway, I glanced back. Billy Boy and Henry were spying through the front window. Then two more heads popped into view-former hippies Paul and Sarah Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson led me to the parked Mercedes and kindly opened the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents were impressed with my chauffeur and gothic limo service, even if the chauffeur was unusually creepy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-11.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
