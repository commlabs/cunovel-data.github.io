He had seen her in the small neighborhood park located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac every night for the past week, felt himself drawn to her without knowing why. Perhaps it was the golden color of her hair, or simply the knowledge that she looked as lost and alone as he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, she was crying. Silent tears washed down her cheeks as she stared at the swings silhouetted in the darkness. He noticed she made no move to wipe the tears away, only sat there in the dark, looking forlorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he quite realized what he was doing, he found himself walking toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, startled, as he sat down beside her. He saw the sudden panic that flared in the depths of her dark brown eyes as she started to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed a restraining hand on her arm. \"Don\u0027t go,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, her heart pounding wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered at the sound of his voice. It was deep and sexy and inexplicably sad. \"Who are you?\" She stared at his hand, alarmed by the strength of his grip. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean you no harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her a moment longer, then released his hold on her arm. \"Stay a while,\" he urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She glanced around, reassured by the presence of other people nearby. \"What do you want from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing. I saw you crying, and... you reminded me of someone I knew a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a soft sound of disdain. \"That\u0027s the oldest line in the book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it is,\" he agreed with a wry grin. \"It was old even when I was young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sniffed, wiping the tears from her eyes so she could see him more clearly. \"You don\u0027t look so old to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m older than you think,\" he replied ruefully. \"Tell me, why do you weep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weep?\" She laughed softly. In all her 23 years, she\u0027d never heard anyone use that word except in books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crying,\" he said persistently. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you care? You don\u0027t even know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, bewildered by his attraction to this strange woman. And yet there was something about her that drew him, some indefinable essence that reminded him of Sara Jayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen you sitting here every night for the past week,\" he said with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I like to walk through the park in the evening,\" he said, his gaze lingering on the pulse throbbing in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know it\u0027s not safe to wander around after dark in L.A.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I\u0027m hoping some pervert will come along and do me in,\" she retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you in?\" He frowned at her as he sought to comprehend her meaning. Language, too, had changed drastically in the last half-century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill me,\" she said bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Maybe I am. Maybe I\u0027m tired of living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so young,\" he muttered. \"How could you possibly be tired of living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe because I\u0027ve got nothing to live for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the concrete path beneath her feet, wishing she had never been born. Everyone she had ever loved was dead. Why hadn\u0027t she died, too? What was there to live for now? A rainy night, a drunk driver, and she had lost her parents, her husband, her baby daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" he asked. But he knew, knew what it would be even before she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah. What\u0027s yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment. \"Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Gabriel, it was nice to meet you, but I think I\u0027ll be going now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be here tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her walk away, felt the pain and the despair that engulfed her, the all-encompassing sense of loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah, wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an impatient sigh, she turned around, waiting for him to catch up with her. He was a tall man, with long black hair and dark gray eyes. He had the look of a foreigner, she thought, though she had detected no accent in his voice. Spanish, or maybe Italian, she decided, but she didn\u0027t really care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want now?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me walk you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Gabriel, I guess you\u0027re trying to be nice, but I\u0027m really not in the mood for company, so why don\u0027t you just go away and leave me alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Gabriel said. Taking her hand, he bowed over it. \"I\u0027m sorry to have troubled you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah stared after him as he walked away, bewildered by his old-world courtliness. She took a few steps, then turned back, intending to apologize for her rudeness, but it was too late. He was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around, wondering how he had disappeared so quickly, and then, with a sigh, she walked home, back to the quiet four-bedroom house that had once symbolized everything she held dear; a house that was empty now, as empty as her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, she sat in the front room, sitting in the dark as she had every night since she got home from the hospital. She couldn\u0027t make herself sleep in the king-size bed she had shared with David, couldn\u0027t make herself go into the nursery. She didn\u0027t answer the phone, didn\u0027t open the mail, didn\u0027t turn on the television. She slept during the day so she wouldn\u0027t have to remember how full her life had once been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the accident, each new day had been brimming with promise. On weekday mornings, she had spent a quiet half-hour with David before he went to work, packing his lunch, eating breakfast, kissing him good-bye. Shortly thereafter, Natalie would wake up, eager to be held. She\u0027d been such a happy, contented baby, always smiling, her chubby fingers reaching out to grasp at life, eager to explore...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah shook her head, willing the images away, not wanting to remember, unable to forget. She closed her eyes and the memory of a tiny white coffin resting amid three larger ones rose up to haunt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears came then, and she huddled in a corner of the sofa, steeped in misery, wishing the stranger she\u0027d met in the park had been the depraved killer she had read about in the paper a few days before the accident. The woman in the story had claimed that a monster with red eyes had attacked her in an alley and bitten her in the neck. \"Just like Dracula,\" she had claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah frowned. Perhaps, subconsciously, she\u0027d been hoping to run into the blood-sucker when she started walking in the park at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before sleep claimed her, she found herself thinking of the strange man in the park. There had been a world of sadness in the depths of his dark gray eyes, but she had been too caught up in her own misery to spare a thought for his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, on the brink of sleep, she wondered if he, too, had lost a loved one. If he, too, had been wandering in the dark, searching for oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreamed of him that night, odd, fragmented dreams that made no sense upon awaking, but then, dreams never made sense in the cold light of day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a little while, she stared up at the ceiling, trying to remember what the dreams had been about, but all she could remember was the sound of his voice, lost and alone, whispering her name, and the sadness in his eyes, a sorrow that went beyond grief, beyond pain. An endless eternity of sadness, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah glanced at the window, saw that it was almost dawn, and drew the covers up over her head, shutting out the light, turning her back on the memories that crowded in on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to the park that night. Sitting on the hard stone bench, she stared at the swings, wondering why she did this to herself. On one level, she told herself she didn\u0027t want to remember, yet she came here every night and stared at the swing, remembering the sound of Natalie\u0027s laughter as her grandmother pushed her in the swing, higher and higher...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he was there even before he appeared beside the bench. Looking up at him, she refused to admit that she had come to the park that night hoping to see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening,\" Gabriel said. He gestured at the bench. \"May I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It\u0027s a free country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing black again. Black T-shirt, black jeans, black cowboy boots. Somehow, she couldn\u0027t imagine him in any other color. He was dark and mysterious, like the night, she thought fancifully, and black suited him very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you this evening, Sarah?\" he asked, and his voice was warm and thick, like sun-baked honey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel shook his head. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know anything about me,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re grieving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can feel your pain, Sarah, your sorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? You\u0027ve lost loved ones who were very dear to you. A husband, a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, her dark brown eyes mirroring her confusion, her anxiety. \"How can you possibly know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled faintly. \"I have a talent for reading minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe in that kind of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lost your parents, too, and you feel guilty because they died and you didn\u0027t. You come here in the evening because your house is empty, and the nighttime hours are too long and too lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had frightened her now. He could see it in the sudden tensing of her shoulders, in the way she held herself, rigid and poised for flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you know that?\" she demanded, her anger overriding her fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I have the ability to divine your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I thinking now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wishing a policeman would come by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah laughed softly. \"Not likely at this time of night. They\u0027re all at Winchell\u0027s having donuts and coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed with her, the first time he had laughed in years, and it felt good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile transformed his face, and for the first time Sarah realized that he was quite a handsome man. Feeling as though she were being disloyal to David, she quickly put the thought from her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better go,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean you no harm, Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but... I\u0027m not... I can\u0027t...\" She stood up, her arms crossed over her breasts. \"Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her walk away, and then he dissolved into a dark mist and followed her home. He stood in the shadows outside her house until he was sure she was safely inside. Only then did he turn away, hoping desperately that he would see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the park the next night, and the next, and the next, not knowing what it was about this strange man that drew her back to him night after night. She only knew that he seemed familiar somehow, that his very presence soothed her in some indefinable way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir relationship was a strange one. They sat side by side, rarely speaking, yet each drawing comfort from the other\u0027s presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two weeks, Gabriel had decided their nightly encounters were destined to go on that way indefinitely, with the two of them meeting and not speaking; more than strangers, less than friends. And yet, for him, for now, it was enough. Meeting Sarah each evening gave purpose to his life, gave him something to look forward to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she showed up late one night, her face whiter than new-fallen snow, her eyes shadowed and red, her whole demeanor one of abject despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel rose to his feet as she walked toward him, alarmed by her appearance. \"Sarah, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him, her arms hanging limply at her sides. \"It\u0027s July first,\" she said, her voice ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded, not comprehending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have been our fourth anniversary.\" Tears welled in her eyes and cascaded down her cheeks. \"Natalie would have been two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She screamed the word at him. \"Why did it happen?\" Sobs shook her body as she pummeled his chest with her fists. \"Why didn\u0027t we stay home that night? Why didn\u0027t I die, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit him again and again, needing to vent her anger, to unleash the rage she had kept carefully bottled up for the past six months. And all the while she asked the same question over and over again: Why, why, why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no answer, only stood there while her tightly clenched fists pounded against his chest and tears streamed down her cheeks, until she collapsed against him, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurmuring her name, he swept her into his arms and cradled her against his chest, holding her effortlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still the tears came, with no sign of letting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel glanced around. There weren\u0027t many people wandering through the park at this time of night - a couple of kids pawing each other in the shadows, a vagrant snoring beneath a tree - yet Gabriel felt the need to get her inside, away from prying eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSettling her more firmly in his arms, he started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took several minutes for Sarah to realize they were leaving the park. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I can\u0027t go back there.\" She couldn\u0027t face that dark, empty house, couldn\u0027t face the memories that were waiting to engulf her. She shuddered, as though overcome with a chill. \"Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went limp in his arms, trusting him without knowing why, or maybe simply too emotionally wrung out to care what happened to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, her cheek resting against his chest. Cool air feathered over her face as he walked along, his footsteps light and even, as if he were floating instead of walking. She seemed to hear his voice inside her mind, urging her to relax, to rest, assuring her that everything would be all right. And she believed him. It felt good to have someone taking care of her again, even if that someone was a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d gone only a few blocks when he felt the tension drain out of her and knew she\u0027d fallen asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long walk to the mansion, but he carried her easily, using the power of his mind to cloak their presence as a police car drove by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door of the mansion opened at his bidding, then closed behind him. He carried her up the long, winding staircase and down the hall to the bedroom at the end of the spacious corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred as he bent over the bed to draw back the covers, her eyelids fluttering open, her brown eyes wide and bewildered as she looked up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t want to go to your house, so I brought you to mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew a moment of gut-wrenching fear. For some reason, it had been easy to trust him out in the open, but here, in this unfamiliar room, she felt trapped, defenseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, her voice too high, \"I can\u0027t stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark gaze held hers. \"Go to sleep, Sarah,\" he said quietly. \"You\u0027ve nothing to fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd once again, she believed him without knowing why. She felt suddenly weightless, limp. Her eyelids fluttered down. She sighed once, and then she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel stood at the foot of the bed, watching her for a long while. He seemed to have a habit of picking up orphans and strays, he thought ruefully, but there was something about this girl that called to him. Perhaps it was merely that her hair was the same color as Sara Jayne\u0027s had been. Or perhaps it was because this Sarah, too, was alone in the world. Whatever the reason, he felt an irresistible urge to comfort her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly before dawn, he drove to the all-night market and bought a variety of foodstuffs - an assortment of breakfast cereal, fruit, milk, instant coffee, tea, bread, butter, jelly, eggs, cheese. A jar of bubble bath that smelled like wildflowers, a bar of scented soap. A bottle of dark red wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFood had changed, too, he thought as he dumped a package of meat into the wobbly shopping cart. Bread came already sliced and neatly wrapped in plastic. Milk came in various-sized containers, though he couldn\u0027t remember seeing any cows in the vicinity. Not only that, but there were now all kinds of milk: low fat, no fat, whole, raw, homogenized. In his youth, there had been but one kind of milk, the kind that came straight out of the cow, unless one preferred the milk of goats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to remember what eating three meals a day had been like as he drove home; tried to remember the taste of bread, of butter, of eggs and cheese, as he carried the brown paper bags into the kitchen and began to put things away. But he had no recollection of tastes or textures, save for the vague memory of forcing himself to eat a meal Sara Jayne had prepared for him a century ago, and all he really remembered of that experience was going outside to vomit it back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned wryly as he opened the refrigerator. He had lived in this place for three months and this was the first time he had used the refrigerator to hold anything other than an occasional bottle of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was climbing over the horizon when he made his way down the short flight of stairs that led to what had once been a wine cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the door, he stepped inside, then bolted the door behind him, wondering if she would still be there when he woke that evening. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/embrace-the-night/page-31.html","bookId":2307,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM"}
