It was an odd setting for it, but he found himself blessed by this quiet moment, just the two of them, her opening up to him at last, trusting him. \"How did you get to Steve Pickard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In high school, I was doing early college coursework for a business degree. Did an internship with him. He learned about my situation, and instead of seeing me as a liability, he groomed me. He took more than a chance on me. He saved me, and my family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth of it was obvious from the emotion that crept in her voice. Lucas made a mental note to put Pickard Industries at the top of the list of those who could ask K\u0026amp;A for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCass was silent a moment, remembering when Steve had cornered her in a cubicle, a defensive seventeen-year-old, and told her he was going to pay for a part-time nanny to allow her to expand her studies, go to a local college for her degree. Before she\u0027d been able to reject it, he\u0027d told her flatly that she was an investment. \"You\u0027re a damn teenager, raising a bunch of kids as if they were your own. I\u0027ve heard you on this phone every other day, handling social workers, police, doctors, nurses, your own fucked-up parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve done all that, managed to keep your family together and worked this job, balanced it with school. Anyone who has those skills has the makings of the best negotiator I can buy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been a frequent visitor at her home ever since, particularly at holidays. He\u0027d become a grandfatherly figure to Nate, taking him out on trips, doing guy things. Otherwise the little boy would have been raised only by females, since she\u0027d obtained restraining orders against both his father and older brother, with George\u0027s help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve denied yourself relationships to protect them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she snapped, defensiveness surging forward again. \"That\u0027s what you do when you have kids. I have four sisters, Lucas, four very pretty sisters, not that that matters, from ages eight to sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching her chin, he forced her face up. \"You don\u0027t think I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No.\" She recalled herself enough to close her hand on his, realizing his comment had been an observation, not an accusation at her prolonged silence. \"I know you would never. But the news is full of women who let their personal needs interfere with their first responsibility, to their children. And these girls and Nate have dealt with so much. They require a stable influence in their life, one person who puts them first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. They do.\" He held her gaze. \"Part of teaching kids about life is letting them see a healthy, loving relationship between two people that includes them, doesn\u0027t leave them out. But it should also teach them they don\u0027t get to be number one in every situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is about give and take, sharing. Their big sister deserves a life, too, if she\u0027s busting her ass to give them everything they need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her forehead. \"Lucas, I\u0027m just not sure—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did the corset come into it?\" He glanced toward the garment, still folded on the seat, but then brought his attention back to her neckline. Because it was his shirt, he didn\u0027t need to slip a button to let his finger play along the curve of her breast in the opening, using a silken lock of her hair to tease the skin. Cassandra was mesmerized by it, the intent way he looked at her body. At her. She swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to distract me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it working?\" His eyes were even more silver in this light, she noticed, his brows a tarnished gold. No man should have a nose that straight, which now coaxed the trail of her fingertips, down to his lips, which pressed against them, a lingering kiss as she drew away, considered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were some really rough days,\" she relented. \"Fighting with social workers, my mother\u0027s doctors, the police, when Jeremy acted up. Trying to keep my dad out of our lives. One day, I just lost it at the family services office. When I was screaming and crying, some part of me stepped outside myself, took a hard look. Not just at me, but the people around me. I realized I looked just like everyone else there. Run down by life, my behavior and my appearance resulting in a complete lack of credibility. I started paying attention to people who commanded respect, how they handled themselves and spoke, and realized it had nothing to do with money. It had to do with confidence and self-respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the corsets?\" he persisted. \"How did that happen?\" She colored a little. \"If you laugh, I will smack you.\" He forced a smile. \"I won\u0027t laugh.\" In truth, Lucas didn\u0027t feel anything like laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The night after that happened, I couldn\u0027t sleep. I caught one of those black-and-white movies based on a Jane Austen novel. Looking at the women in corsets, I realized how constrained and elegant they had to be, and figured the outfit helped them maintain that composure. During that time period, everything had a required behavior, so they probably felt like screaming, too.\" Humor flickered over her soft mouth, then she glanced at the corset. \"The first time I bought one secondhand, I felt silly, but when I put it on, I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControlled by that garment, I was in control of myself. People don\u0027t challenge people who approach things calmly, prepared to answer hard questions without making it personal. But you\u0027re right.\" Her gaze moved to his face, his strong neck, the breadth of his shoulders, feeling the controlling power of his arms around her. \"It can become about something else.\" She trembled a little in his arms when his expression heated at her words. \"So here I am. Me and the part-time nanny, Mrs. Pitt, raised the kids. I got my degree, built my reputation in the firm, and now earn a salary that took us out of the corporate housing Steve made me accept, foiling my stubborn pride with concerns about the kids\u0027 safety, and into a seven-bedroom in the Lakeshore area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas whistled. \"Pretty amazing accomplishment. Lakeshore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas saw fire flicker in her again with the words. While he wanted to be the one to absorb her tears, give her comfort, he was glad to see the spark return. Fanning the flame, he brought her hand to his lips to tease her knuckles with his mouth, liking the way she focused on it, her mouth going soft, giving him all sorts of ideas. But he had one more difficult question. \"Where is she now, your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She died, several years ago.\" When she tried to draw away, he tightened his grasp and she lifted her shadowed face to his. \"Got into her pills and OD\u0027d. I blamed myself for that. I kept her at home instead of a facility because I thought that was what she needed, but we couldn\u0027t watch her the way they could have. Anyhow, I had to let it go, because I just don\u0027t have time to think about it, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd can\u0027t afford where the emotions would take her, Lucas thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t save her, and to be honest, I don\u0027t know if she wanted to be saved.\" She drew an unsteady breath. \"So that\u0027s it. I come with five kids who command the lion\u0027s share of my attention, along with my work. A romantic dinner will get interrupted by a crisis involving Cheerios being superglued into someone\u0027s hair. Sex is something you book in advance or steal five minutes in a park like a pair of teenagers, because there\u0027s little privacy at home. And I won\u0027t bring a man into their lives unless he\u0027s wanting to be part of it, not just wanting to have me.\" On this her chin firmed, eyes resolute. \"I may not be able to say no to the sex you\u0027re offering, but I can\u0027t take it near my siblings. They latch on to an adult male far too quickly. I\u0027m not saying that if you walk through the door, you\u0027re agreeing to a life commitment, but you\u0027ve got to care and think it\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m more concerned as to whether you think it\u0027s possible.\" He touched her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I do. I am sorry, Cass. About all of it. Especially your brother. You feel like you\u0027ve failed because you can\u0027t save him yourself, but to me, it sounds like you already saved five other lives. I was right, what went through my mind that day, when I saw you in the Berkshires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she raised a curious brow, he drew her back to his mouth, pausing just before their lips touched. \"I told myself, \u0027Lucas, you\u0027ve just found the most amazing woman you\u0027ll ever meet. Don\u0027t let her get away.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCass\u0027s Lakeshore brick home had a welcoming style, with potted plants on the front porch, a circular driveway, and a wide lawn. It - was positioned in a quiet neighborhood laid out well for children playing, people walking pets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they went through the wrought iron gate, Cass nodding to the security guard, Lucas saw a teenager on the front stoop doing homework, while a little boy of about five years worked his way around the driveway on a bike with training wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the limo pulled to a halt, the teenager got up, a brown-eyed girl with Cass\u0027s blond hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty enough to already be attracting men\u0027s eyes, she could use an older brother looking out for her. That was his first thought. Of course, something about this girl\u0027s firm chin and direct gaze, so much like her sister\u0027s, suggested she wouldn\u0027t take kindly to that idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cass got out of the car, Lucas understood why she\u0027d wanted so much to go home after the ugliness with Jeremy. She\u0027d barely dropped to one knee before Nate had launched himself off the bike and at her, wrapping his arms around her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy!\" Lucas\u0027s surprise at the address was distracted by the child\u0027s grin, competition for the brightness of sunshine. He was a younger, far less haggard version of his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a brutal squeeze, he released her to gesture to the bike. \"I\u0027m riding. Marcie says I\u0027m doing good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. I saw, coming up the driveway. Nate, Marcie, this is my friend, Mr. Adler. He works for K\u0026amp;A,\" she added to Marcie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re one of the wunderkind!\u0027 Marcie gave him a shrewd assessment. \"The CFO.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sister\u0027s mentioned me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. She—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mentioned all of you.\" Cass shot Marcie a narrow glance. \"Marcie is already studying business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcie gave her an odd look, but then shifted her attention back to Lucas. \"I looked you up on the Internet. Really clever business model presentation to Harvard Business School, by the way. But where does Matt Kensington find you guys? Vegas strip shows?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/controlled-response-knights-of-the-board-room-2/page-25.html","bookId":1901,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM"}
