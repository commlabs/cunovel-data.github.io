Price leans against the door of our stall and stares at me in this hopeless way. He rubs a trembling hand over his still-crimson face and shuts his eyes tightly, lips white, slight residue of cocaine under one nostril - and then quietly he says, without opening his eyes, \"Okay. Let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the spirit,\" I say. We take turns digging our respective cards into the envelope until what we can\u0027t get with the cards we press our fingers into and snort or lick off the tips then rub into our gums. I\u0027m not anywhere near high but another J\u0026amp;B might give the body a false enough impression to kick in some kind of rush no matter how weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping out of the stall we wash our hands, inspecting our reflections in the mirror, and, once satisfied, head back to the Chandelier Room. I\u0027m beginning to wish I\u0027d checked my overcoat (Armani) but no matter what Price says I feel kind of high and minutes later as I wait at the bar trying to get this hardbody\u0027s attention it starts not to matter. I finally have to lay a twenty on the counter to get her attention, even though I have plenty of drink tickets left. It works. Taking advantage of the drink tickets, I order two double Stolis on the rocks. She pours the drinks in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m feeling good and I shout out to her, \"Hey, don\u0027t you go to NYU?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, unsmiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunter?\" I shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head again. Not Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Columbia?\" I shout - though that\u0027s a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continues to concentrate on the bottle of Stoli. I decide not to continue the conversation and just slap the drink tickets on the bar as she places the two glasses in front of me. But she shakes her head and shouts, \"It\u0027s after eleven. Those aren\u0027t good anymore. It\u0027s a cash bar. That\u0027ll be twenty-five dollars,\" and without complaining, playing it totally cool, I pull out my gazelleskin wallet and hand her a fifty which she eyes, I swear, contemptuously and, sighing, turns to the cash register and finds my change and I say, staring at her, quite clearly but muffed by \"Pump Up the Volume\" and the crowd, \"You are a f**king ugly bitch I want to stab to death and play around with your blood,\" but I\u0027m smiling. I leave the cunt no tip and find Price who is standing again, morosely, by the railings, his hands gripping the steel bars. Paul Owen, who is handling the Fisher account, is wearing a six-button double-breasted wool tuxedo and he stands next to Price screaming something like \"Ran five hundred iterations of discounted cash flow minus on an ICM PC took company cab to Smith and Wollensky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand the drink to Price, while nodding to Paul. Price says nothing, not even thanks. He just holds the drink and mournfully stares at the tracks and then he squints and bends his head down to the glass and when the strobe lights start flashing, he stands up straight and murmurs something to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you high?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you?\" Owen shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very happy,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music is one long, unending song that overlaps with other, separate songs connected only by a dull thumping beat and it obliterates all conversation which, while I\u0027m talking to a weasel like Owen, is perfectly okay with me. There seem to be more girls in the Chandelier Room now and I try to make eye contact with one of them - model type with big tits. Price nudges me and I lean in to ask if we should perhaps get another am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you wearing a tuxedo?\" Owen asks, behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving,\" Price shouts. \"I\u0027m getting out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leaving what?\" I shout back, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This,\" he shouts, referring to, I\u0027m not sure but I think, his double Stoli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027ll drink it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, Patrick,\" he screams. \"I\u0027m leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\" I really am confused. \"You want me to find Ricardo?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-25.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
