Not a single person realized that he was one of the five celestials of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun suddenly realized that keeping a low profiles was great, and in some ways, was better than doing things the normal way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder a lot of big shots like to secretly mingle with the common people. It\u0027s a really wonderful feeling.” It was truly nice to be in a situation like this in which he faced absolutely no danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the deva saw his seemingly pleased smile, and heard his words, he suddenly got a very strange feeling. However, he didn’t pay too much attention to that feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This shady character is trying to sneak into the capital city!” the deva announced. “Arrest him for further inspection. If he checks out, send him on his way, and if he resists, execute him on the spot!” The crowd began to back up even further. Some of them were looking at Bai Xiaochun sympathetically, but more had looks of open scorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this guy an idiot, or what? Who would dare to make a scene right here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would he do this? That’s Marquis Zi Lin! All he has to do is step to the side. It’s not like they asked him to cut his own arm off or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s finished. Nowadays, anybody who gets arrested like this ends up getting thrown in prison and never coming out again!” Cold gleams appeared in the eyes of the guards, all of whom, with the exception of the one who had already been stunned into immobility by Bai Xiaochun, hurried forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun actually hadn’t expected the deva to just immediately have him arrested. A strange expression appeared on his face as he sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the point of all this? I just wanted to get into the city…. And I was trying to keep a low profile.” Shaking his head, he waved his hand. He didn’t reveal his celestial cultivation base, he just used some nascent soul-level power, one level above these Core Formation guards. A windstorm sprang up, pushing the guards so hard that they were shoved back across the ground. One of them even coughed up some blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What gall!” the deva shouted. “Get on your knees immediately!” Blurring into motion, he shot forward, fueling his hand with a burst of deva power to slap Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the deva’s mind, this blow would probably not be deadly, but it would at least force this person onto his knees!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerision filled his heart. If this person had simply backed down, he would have just been punished a bit. But since he decided to resist, then it meant he was foolishly asking to be killed. Therefore, the deva’s actions were all in accord with the strict laws of the capital city!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even as the deva’s hand began to move, Bai Xiaochun sighed and sent his right hand flying toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about you kneel instead?” Even as the words left his mouth, a smacking sound filled the air. The deva’s vision swam as a massive, unavoidable force hit him. His mind went blank, and he was nearly deafened. Blood then sprayed out of his mouth as he was smacked out of the air to land hard on the ground, right in front of Bai Xiaochun, his knees shattered, and blood oozing out all over him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intense pain he felt prompted a hoarse scream. He wanted to stand up, but his broken knees wouldn’t permit it. Worse, his cultivation base was teetering on the point of collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the crowd was stunned, and many a gasp could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, you’re not a Nascent Soul cultivator!” the deva cried. “But even if you \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e a deva, you’re still dead!!” Trying to ignore the intense pain, he pulled out a jade slip, which he crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that jade slip acted like an alarm trigger, and instantly caused numerous beams of light to rise up from within the city and head toward the main gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was a bit at a loss as to what to do. He had just wanted to enter the city, but had already caused quite a scene. Shaking his head, he turned and prepared to pass through the shield and enter the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before he could move, Marquis Zi Lin, who had been standing off to the side completely silently up to this point, finally spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, his subordinates rushed forth with coldly gleaming eyes. Five devas and more than ten Nascent Soul cultivators all stepped forward, giving rise to shocking energy. For many of the onlookers, this was an incredible scene the likes of which they would rarely be able to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a pity you didn’t reveal your deva cultivation base earlier,” Marquis Zi Lin continued. “Clearly you’re trying to show off. Finished? My subordinates have all grown up on the battlefield. Each of them have killed more than 10,000 enemies!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs some in the crowd sighed about what was surely to come, Bai Xiaochun’s anger flared. After all, he hadn’t caused any trouble for this Marquis Zi Lin. Yet despite that, the man was clearly singling him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think you can bully me?” Bai Xiaochun said, glaring. He waved his right hand, allowing the power of the great circle of the Deva Realm to sweep out across the incoming subordinates of Marquis Zi Lin. Immediately, their hearts filled with wild shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeafening rumbling sounds filled their ears, and their vision swam as a mountain-toppling, sea-draining force assailed them. There was literally nothing they could do to defend themselves. The five devas in the lead position coughed up mouthfuls of blood as they were forced to the ground in a kneeling position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the ten Nascent Soul cultivators, they were even less able to resist. As they slammed into the ground, bloodcurdling screams echoed out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all happened in the blink of an eye, much to the shock of the onlookers. It was almost unthinkable to see so many powerful cultivators kneeling, right there at the main gate to the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How amusing,” Marquis Zi Lin said, his eyes sparkling, and a slight smile of derision appearing on his face. He strode forward, moving so quickly that a massive wind kicked up. Arriving in front of Bai Xiaochun, he unleashed an energy far more terrifying than what Bai Xiaochun had just unleashed. This was not the early Demigod Realm; it was the power of the great circle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Bai Xiaochun’s expression remained the same as ever as he reached out with his right hand and casually waved his hand toward Marquis Zi Lin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You kneel too!” he said coolly. His hand became something like an all-destructive mountain that could crush everything. Marquis Zi Lin seemed like he had been moving quickly, but to Bai Xiaochun, it was nothing more than a snail’s pace. As for the wind he had kicked up, it felt like the breath of a child, and the massive force that caused the air to ripple was so weak he could dispel it with ease!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the difference between demigods and celestials, and showed how vastly superior a Daoseed was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as Bai Xiaochun’s palm hit, not the Marquis Zi Lin there in front of him, but something obscured behind him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air rippled and distorted as a second Marquis Zi Lin stumbled out. That was how Marquis Zi Lin operated. When he appeared in public, he would keep his true self hidden, and have a clone act openly. Of course, demigods in the Heavenspan Realm couldn’t normally create clones, and it was the same for demigods in the Eternal Immortal Domains, which made this strategy particularly effective, and also rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust now, he had sent his clone over to test Bai Xiaochun a bit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever could he have imagined that his test would be crushed as if by a mountain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buzz of conversation rose up as both Marquis Zi Lin and his clone had their cultivation bases nearly destroyed. The intense force he could now sense caused him to tremble, and his eyes to shine with disbelief. He wanted to ask this person who he was, but before he could, the energy slammed into him, forcing him down. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as well as his clone’s mouth as both of them were slammed into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThud!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust billowed out as the audience looked on, stunned. Marquis Zi Lin’s subordinates were in a daze, but even more shocked was the deva in charge of this gate. Waves of shock battered him as he realized that there was only one explanation for this, as unbelievable as it seemed. As soon as the idea entered his head, it nearly drove him mad!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ce… celestial….”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1100\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1102\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1101","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
