The sign said bar, and if it had more of a name than that they were keeping it a secret. It was a small room, its board floor liberally strewn with sawdust. There was a sandwich menu posted, and a pot of coffee made. I was glad to see that. It was a little early in the day for Coca-Cola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender was a beefy fellow with a flattop haircut and a brushy moustache. There were three men standing at the bar, two of them in butcher\u0027s aprons, both of the aprons richly bloodstained. There were half a dozen square tables of dark wood, all of them empty. Ballou got a glass of whiskey and a cup of black coffee from the bar and led me to the table that was farthest from the door. I sat down. He started to sit, then looked at his glass and saw that it didn\u0027t hold enough. He went back to the bar and returned with the bottle. It was Jameson, but not the premium stuff he drank at his own place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his big hand around his glass and raised it a few inches from the tabletop in a wordless toast. I raised my coffee mug in acknowledgment. He drank half the whiskey. It might have been water for all the effect it had on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"We have to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew the minute I looked at the girl. Didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took me on the blind side, it did. You came in talking about poor Eddie Dunphy. And then we talked about every damned thing, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought what a devious bastard you were, leading me round the barn and then dropping her picture on the table. But that wasn\u0027t it at all, was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t have anything to connect her to you or to Neil. I was just trying to find out what was on Eddie\u0027s mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I had no reason to have my guard up. I didn\u0027t know a fucking thing about Eddie or his mind or what he might have had on it.\" He drank the rest of the whiskey and put the glass on the table. \"Matt, I have to do this. Come into the men\u0027s room so I can be certain you\u0027re not wearing a wire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk around the point. I want to say whatever comes to mind and I can\u0027t do that unless I know you\u0027re clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lavatory was small and dank and foul. It wouldn\u0027t hold us both comfortably, so he stood outside and held the door open. I took off my jacket and shirt and tie and lowered my trousers while he apologized for the indignity of it all. Then he held my jacket while I got dressed. I took my time getting my tie knotted right, then took my jacket from him and put it on. We went back to the table and sat down, and he poured more whiskey into his glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The girl\u0027s dead,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething settled lower within me. I had known she was dead, had sensed it and reasoned it both, but evidently there had been a part of me that had gone on hoping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometime in July. I don\u0027t know the date.\" He gripped his glass but didn\u0027t lift it. \"Before Neil came to work for me he was behind the bar at a tourist place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Druid\u0027s Castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d know that, of course. He had a racket there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Credit cards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"He came to me with it, I put him in touch with someone. There\u0027s a lot of money in it, those little plastic cards, though it\u0027s not the kind of business I care for, not for myself. You can\u0027t get your hands into it, it\u0027s moving numbers around. But it was a good thing for all concerned, and then they caught on at the restaurant and they let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where he met Paula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"She was in it with him. She would run an impression of the cards on her own machine before she took the cards to the cashier. Or they\u0027d give her their carbons to tear up, only she wouldn\u0027t do it, she\u0027d pass them on to Neil. After he left she stayed on there, and he had her bringing slips and carbons to him, he had girls at a couple of places doing that. But then she quit, she didn\u0027t care to wait on tables anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the glass and took a drink. \"She moved in with him. She kept her room so that her parents wouldn\u0027t know what she was doing. Sometimes she came to the bar when he was working, but more often she\u0027d wait and come by for him when his shift was over. He didn\u0027t just tend bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He still had his credit card scam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That didn\u0027t last. But hanging around, you know, he found things to do. You could tell him the make and model and he\u0027d steal you a car. He went along a couple of times when some boys took off a truck. There\u0027s good money in that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure there is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The details don\u0027t matter. He was all right, you know, for what he was. But it bothered me, having her around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she didn\u0027t fit. She was along for the ride but she didn\u0027t belong. What does her father do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sells Japanese cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And not stolen ones, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t think so, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe uncapped the bottle, raised it. He asked me if I wanted more coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should be drinking coffee myself. When I\u0027m up this long, though, the whiskey is like coffee to me, it fuels it and keeps it all rolling.\" He filled his glass. \"She was a nice Protestant girl from Indiana,\" he said. \"She\u0027d steal, but she stole for the thrill of it. You can\u0027t trust that, it\u0027s almost as bad as a man who kills for the thrill of it. A good thief doesn\u0027t steal for the thrill. He steals for the money. And the best thief of all steals because he\u0027s a thief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to Paula?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She heard something she shouldn\u0027t have heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to know. Ah, what\u0027s the difference? There were these dago bastards brought in a load of heroin and sold it, and someone shot the whole fucking lot of them and took their money. There was something in the papers. They got it all wrong, but maybe you remember it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had her out at the farm. There\u0027s a farm up in Ulster County, it has another man\u0027s name on the deed, but it\u0027s mine the way the car and Grogan\u0027s are mine.\" He took a drink. He said, \"I don\u0027t own a fucking thing, can you believe that? One fellow lets me drive his car, another lets me live in an apartment even if his name\u0027s on the lease. And there\u0027s this couple, his people are from County Westmeath, he\u0027s always liked the country. He and his wife live there and the deed says they own it, and he milks the cows and slops the hogs and she feeds the chickens and collects the eggs, and I can go and stay up there anytime I want. And if some bastard from Internal Revenue ever wants to know where my money came from, why, what money? What do I own I ever had to buy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neil had Paula at the farm,\" I prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And everyone was relaxed, and talking freely, and she heard too damn much. And she wouldn\u0027t stand up, you know. If anyone was to ask her a question, she\u0027d be the white-bread Protestant girl from Indiana, you know, and she\u0027d tell them everything. So I told Neil he had to get rid of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ordered him to kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell I did!\" He slammed the glass on the table, and at first I thought his anger was for me, that the question itself enraged him. \"I never told him to kill her,\" he said. \"I said he should send her to hell and gone out of New York. She\u0027d be no danger if she wasn\u0027t around. She wouldn\u0027t have anybody asking her questions back in Indiana, not the cops nor the fucking guineas either. But if she was around, you know, there was always the chance she could turn out to be a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he mistook your orders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did not. Because he came back and told me it was all taken care of. She\u0027d got on a plane to Indianapolis and we\u0027d never be seeing her again. She was all checked out of her room, all on her way back home, and she was no loose end for anybody to be nervous about.\" He picked up his glass again, put it down, pushed it a few inches away from him. \"The other night,\" he said, \"when I turned over the card you gave me and saw her picture staring back at me, it gave me a turn. Because why would anyone come around looking for a girl who was back home with her mother and father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I asked him. \"What happened, Neil? If you\u0027ve sent the girl home, why have her parents hired a man to search for her?\u0027 She went home to Indiana, he said, but she didn\u0027t stay. She got right on a plane to Los Angeles to make her fortune in Hollywood. And never so much as called her parents? Well, he said, perhaps something happened to her out there. Perhaps she took to drugs, or fell in with a bad lot. After all, she\u0027d got into the fast life here, so she might have gone looking for it out there. I knew he was lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I let it go for then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called me,\" I said. \"It must have been Saturday morning, early. Probably just a few hours after he closed up at Grogan\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked with him that night. We locked the door and turned down the lights and drank whiskey and he told me how she\u0027d gone to Hollywood to be a movie star. And then he called you? What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I should stop looking for her. That I was wasting my time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid lad. Stupid call to make. Just let you know you were getting on to something, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Gave it all away myself, didn\u0027t I? But I never knew I had anything to give away. Thought for all the world she was home in Indiana. What\u0027s the name of the town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muncie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muncie, that\u0027s it.\" He looked at his whiskey, then drank some of it. I never drank Irish much but I got a sudden sense-memory of it now, not as smoky as scotch or as oily as bourbon. I drank the rest of my coffee, gulping it as if it were an antidote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I knew he was lying. I gave him a little time to let his nerves get the better of him, and then last night I took him for a long ride upstate and got it all out of him. We went up to Ellenville. That\u0027s where the farm is. That\u0027s where he took her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever it was. July. He took her there for a last weekend, he said, a treat before she went back home where she came from. And he gave her a little cocaine, he said, and her heart failed. She didn\u0027t take that much, he said, but you can\u0027t predict with cocaine, it will get the better of you now and then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s how she died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Because the bastard was lying. I got the story out of him. He took her up to the farm and told her how she had to go home. And she refused, and she got drunk and angry and started threatening to go to the police. And she was making a lot of noise, and he was afraid she\u0027d rouse the couple who take care of the place. And, trying to quiet her, he hit her too hard and she died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that wasn\u0027t it either,\" I said. \"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Because why would he drive her a hundred miles to tell her she had to get on an airplane? Christ, what a liar he was!\" He flashed a shark\u0027s grin. \"But, you know, I didn\u0027t have to read him his rights. He didn\u0027t have the right to remain silent. He didn\u0027t have the right to an attorney.\" Unconsciously his hand moved to touch one of the darker stains on the front of his apron. \"He talked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He took her up there to kill her, of course. He claimed she never would have agreed to go home, that he\u0027d sounded her out on it, that all she did was swear she could be counted on to keep her mouth shut. He took her up to the farm and gave her a lot to drink and then took her outside and made love to her in the grass. Had all her clothes off, laid with her in the moonlight. And then while she was lying there afterward he took out a knife and let her see it. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 she said. \u0027What are you going to do?\u0027 And he stabbed her.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-29.html","bookId":2325,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM"}
