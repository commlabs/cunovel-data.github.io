What part of the beast you ate matters not. What does matter is your age at the time you slew it. Legend puts you at everything from four to fourteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" Royce mocked drily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought the story was true,\" Jenny said, eyeing him quizzically. \"I mean the part about you slaying a wolf as a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce\u0027s lips twitched. \"Henry dubbed me the Wolf at Bosworth Field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you killed one there!\" Gawin decreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" Royce corrected, \"there was too much fighting and too little food to keep flesh on my bones. At the end of the battle, Henry looked at my lean frame and my dark hair and said I reminded him of a hungry wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think—\" Gawin decreed, but Royce cut him off with a quelling look that clearly said he\u0027d had enough of Gawin\u0027s antics for the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny, who\u0027d been carefully concealing the recurring pains assailing her, glanced at Aunt Elinor and nodded imperceptibly. Leaning close to Royce, she said softly, \"I think I\u0027ll rest for a little while. Don\u0027t get up.\" He squeezed her hand and nodded agreeably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jenny arose, so did Aunt Elinor, but she paused beside Arik, her hand on the back of his chair. \"You have not opened your present, dear boy,\" she told him. Everyone else had exchanged gifts today, but Arik had been absent until supper time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArik hesitated, his big hand atop the small, silk-wrapped item beside his trencher. Looking sublimely uncomfortable to be the focus of so much attention, he awkwardly unwrapped it, glanced at the heavy silver chain with a small, round object dangling from it, then covered it with his hand. A curt, uneasy nod expressed his \"profound gratitude,\" but Aunt Elinor was not put off. As he started to arise from the table she smiled at him and said, \"There\u0027s dried grapevine blossom within it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heavy brows drew together, and even though he spoke in his lowest tone, his voice boomed. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning close to his ear, she whispered authoritatively, \"Because serpents loathe grapevine blossom. \u0027Tis a fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had turned to accompany Jenny, and so she did not see the odd thing that happened to Arik\u0027s face, but nearly everyone else at the table noticed, and they gaped in fascination. For a moment, Arik\u0027s face seemed to stretch tight, and then it began to crack. Crevices formed beside his eyes and pouches developed beneath them. The straight line of his stern lips wavered, first at one corner, then the other, then white teeth appeared…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God\u0027s teeth!\" Godfrey burst out, nudging Lionel and even Brenna in his enthusiasm. \"He\u0027s going to smile! Stefan look at that! Our Arik is—\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodfrey broke off as Royce, who\u0027d been watching Jennifer, thinking she\u0027d intended to sit by the fire, suddenly lurched out of his chair, still holding his tankard of ale, and strode swiftly to the foot of the stairs leading up to the gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jennifer,\" he said, his voice sharp with dawning alarm, \"where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Aunt Elinor looked down from the gallery above and cheerfully replied, \"She is going to have your baby, your grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe serfs in the hall turned to exchange smiling glances, and one of them dashed off to spread the news to the scullions in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not,\" Aunt Elinor warned in direst tones when Royce started up the stairs, \"come up here. I am not inexperienced in these matters, and you will only be in the way. And do not worry,\" she added breezily, noting Royce\u0027s draining color. \"The fact that Jenny\u0027s mother died in childbirth is nothing to be concerned about.\" Royce\u0027s tankard crashed to the stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later, the serfs, villeins, vassals, and knights who were kneeling in the bailey were no longer smiling in anticipation of the arrival of the heir to Claymore. They were keeping a vigil, their heads bent in prayer. The baby had not come, and the news filtering down from the frantic serfs within the hall had been increasingly bad. Nor was ft regarded as a good sign that the duke—who rarely set foot in the chapel—had gone in there four hours ago looking tormented and terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces lifted in hope as the doors to the hall were flung open, then they froze in alarm as Lady Elinor went racing into the chapel. A moment later, the duke burst past the doors, running, and though no one could tell from his haggard face what news there was, it was not regarded as a good omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny,\" Royce whispered, leaning over her, his hands braced on either side of her pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blue eyes opened, smiling sleepily at him as she whispered, \"You have a son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce swallowed audibly, smoothing her tousled curls off her cheek. \"Thank you, darling,\" he said helplessly, his voice still raw from the two days of terror he\u0027d lived through. He leaned down and covered her mouth with his own, his tender-rough kiss eloquent of love and profound relief that she was well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen him?\" she asked when he finally lifted his lips from hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, Royce walked over to the wooden cradle where his sleeping infant son lay. Reaching down, he touched the tiny hand with his finger, then he glanced over at Jenny, his brow furrowed with alarm. \"He seems—small.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny chuckled, recalling the heavy broadsword with a ruby embedded in its hilt that Royce had ordered made as soon as she had told him she was with child. \"A little small at the moment,\" she teased, \"to wield his broadsword.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmusement lit his eyes. \"He may never be able to lift the one Arik is having made for him.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-111.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM"}
