It was a cold, grey morning outside and the house was silent but for the noise of Emma working in the kitchen. She didn\u0027t notice Michael had come into the room until he dragged a chair across the floor and away from the table and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hello,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027Sleep well?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded but didn\u0027t say anything. All things considered, he had slept well, but he was too tired to engage in conversation unless he absolutely had to. He knew he\u0027d feel more sociable when he\u0027d had a few minutes to properly wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve been up for ages,\u0027 Emma continued. \u0027There was a storm a couple of hours ago that woke me. I\u0027ve just been in here sorting through the stuff we got while we were out yesterday.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday afternoon\u0027s priority had been to get Carl safely on his way back to the city. Although that in itself hadn\u0027t taken too long to organise and arrange, there had subsequently been much associated thinking, questioning and soul searching which seemed to have prevented Emma and Michael from doing pretty much anything else. The supplies which they had collected from the village had been left in a pile of boxes and bags on the kitchen floor. Emma had worked hard since she\u0027d got up and had sorted most of it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael cleared his throat and rubbed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So how you feeling today?\u0027 he asked, his voice quiet, flat and subdued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped what she was doing and looked up and briefly smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 she replied, giving little away. \u0027What about you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m all right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently and independently they were both still preoccupied with thoughts of Carl, although neither wanted to talk about their missing colleague to the other. Emma found herself wondering what he had found in the city whilst, more pessimistically, Michael was wondering whether he\u0027d got there at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So what are we going to do today?\u0027 Emma asked unexpectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange question, Michael thought. What is there to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Why, what do you want to do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged her shoulders and returned to her work, wondering what had made her ask such a stupid question in the first place. Perhaps it had just been instinctive? Whatever the reason, the lack of any worthwhile answers was depressing. The complete and utter lack of any positive distraction and interest in their lives, coupled with the constant fear of everything beyond the farmhouse walls, was beginning to grind her down. The relentless boredom, fear and frustration hung over her head like a black storm cloud. And the fact that Carl had left only served to increase her negativity further still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maybe we should make something,\u0027 Michael suggested, picking up on Emma\u0027s sadness. Not much of a suggestion, granted, but it was all that he could come up with. \u0027You know, build something...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know. Bloody hell, there must be something we could do. Christ, we could spring clean or decorate a room or bake a fucking cake...I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maybe we could just sit here and watch the clock until we fall asleep. Then we could get up tomorrow and do the same again...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma\u0027s attitude hurt. Michael knew just how she was feeling, but the fact that they had been able to relax a little last night made her apparent anger and disinterest even more frustrating and harder to swallow. Perhaps it was for that very reason that she was like this? Was she now punishing herself for finally allowing herself to drop a few barriers and reveal her true feelings, thoughts and emotions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael wondered if this was how it was always going to be.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-39.html","bookId":2557,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM"}
