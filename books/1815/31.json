I told you they knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That shouldn’t change anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh … Why tell them, then? You wanted them to know, Gideon.” She stared at me when I didn’t say anything. “What did you think would happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never expected to get married, Eva, so forgive me if I didn’t think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” She held up both hands in a gesture of surrender. “I’m confused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I didn’t know how to make things clear. “I can’t … I’m not ready for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved an impatient hand toward the house. “For that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you be more specific?” she asked carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I miss something in there?” Her voice held a sharp note of anger. “What did they say, Gideon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to understand that she was rising to my defense. That only goaded me further. “I came here to be with you. It just so happens you’re spending time with your family—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re your family, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t ask for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as understanding sifted across her face. When pity followed, my fists clenched at my sides. “Don’t look at me like that, Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what to say. Tell me what you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled roughly. “More liquor.” Her mouth curved. “I’m sure you won’t be the first groom who feels the need to drink around his in-laws.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we not call them that, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faint smile faded. “What would that change? You can call them Mr. and Mrs. Stanton, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not the one who’s confused about where I fit here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips pursed. “I’m not sure I agree with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two days ago, they would’ve shaken my hand and called me Cross. Now, it’s hugs and ‘call me Mom’ and smiles that expect something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, she told you not to call her Mom, but I get it. You’re their son by marriage and it’s freaking you out. Still, is it so terrible that they’re happy about it? Would you prefer it if they were like my dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I knew how to deal with anger and disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva took a step back, her eyes dark and wide in the light of a waning moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I retracted, shoving a hand through my hair. I didn’t know how to deal with disappointing her. “Damn it. I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me for a long minute. I looked away, out over the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gideon …” She closed the gap she’d put between us. “Honestly, I get it. My mom’s been married three times. Every time it’s a new instant father figure that I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a stepfather,” I interrupted tersely. “It’s not the same thing. No one gives a shit whether a stepparent likes you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what this is about?” She walked into me and hugged me tight. “They already like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped her close. “They don’t fucking know me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will. And they’re going to love you. You’re every parent’s dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cut the bullshit, Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved away from me, her temper flaring. “You know what? If you didn’t want any in-laws, you should’ve married an orphan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched back toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get back here,” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flipped her middle finger at me over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught her in three strides, grabbing her arm and spinning her back around. “We’re not done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am.” Eva pushed up onto her tiptoes to get in my face, which still left her tilting her head back to glare at me. “You’re the one who wanted to get married. If you’re having cold feet, it’s all on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t make this my problem!” Fury sizzled through my blood, ratcheting up my frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry you didn’t realize the commitment involved more than a convenient piece of ass!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Conveniently unavailable,” I countered, feeling a muscle twitching in my jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was flat on her back in the sand before she knew what hit her. I pinned her down, pressing hard, my mouth on hers to shut her up. She arched, struggling, and I gripped her ponytail to hold her in place. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-31.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
