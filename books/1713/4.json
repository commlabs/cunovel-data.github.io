Majestically situated above the traffic on the 101 Freeway, the cube had been the idea of BioGen\u0027s president, Rick Diehl, who insisted on calling it a hexahedron. The cube looked impressive and high-tech while revealing absolutely nothing about what went on inside - which is exactly how Diehl wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, BioGen maintained forty thousand square feet of nondescript shed space in an industrial park two miles away. It was there that the animal storage facilities were located, along with the more dangerous labs. Josh Winkler, an up-and-coming young researcher, picked up rubber gloves and a surgical mask from a shelf by the door to the animal quarters. His assistant, Tom Weller, was reading a news clipping taped to the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go, Tom,\" Josh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diehl must be crapping in his pants,\" Weller said, pointing to the article. \"Have you read this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh turned to look. It was an article from theWall Street Journal :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENTISTS ISOLATE \"MASTER\" GENE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Genetic Basis for Controlling Other People?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOULOUSE, FRANCE - A team of French biologists have isolated the gene that drives certain people to attempt to control others. Geneticists at the Biochemical Institute of Toulouse University, headed by Dr. Michel Narcejac-Boileau, announced the discovery at a press conference today. \"The gene,\" Dr. Narcejac-Boileau said, \"is associated with social dominance and strong control over other people. We have isolated it in sports leaders, CEOs, and heads of state. We believe the gene is found in all dictators throughout history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Narcejac-Boileau explained that while the strong form of the gene produced dictators, the milder heterozygous form produced a \"moderate, quasi-totalitarian urge\" to tell other people how to run their lives, generally for their own good or for their own safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Significantly, on psychological testing, individuals with the mild form will express the view that other people need their insights, and are unable to manage their own lives without their guidance. This form of the gene exists among politicians, policy advocates, religious fundamentalists, and celebrities. The belief complex is manifested by a strong feeling of certainty, coupled with a powerful sense of entitlement - and a carefully nurtured sense of resentment toward those who don\u0027t listen to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, he urged caution in interpreting the results. \"Many people who are driven to control others merely want everybody to be the same as they are. They can\u0027t tolerate difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis explained the team\u0027s paradoxical finding that individuals with the mild form of the gene were also the most tolerant of authoritarian environments with strict and invasive social rules. \"Our study shows that the gene produces not only a bossy person, but also a person willing to be bossed. They have a distinct attraction to totalitarian states.\" He noted that these people are especially responsive to fashions of all kinds, and suppress opinions and preferences not shared by their group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh said, \"\u0027Especially responsive to fashions\u0027...Is this a joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re serious. It\u0027s marketing,\" Tom Weller said. \"Today everything is marketing. Read the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the French team stopped short of claiming that the mild form of the master gene represented a genetic disease - an \"addiction to belonging,\" as Narcejac-Boileau phrased it - they nevertheless suggested that evolutionary pressures were moving the human race toward ever-greater conformity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unbelievable,\" Josh said. \"These guys in Toulouse hold a press conference and the whole world runs their story about the \u0027master gene\u0027? Have they published in a journal anywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, they just held a press conference. No publication, and no mention of publication.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s next, the slave gene? Looks like crap to me,\" Josh said. He glanced at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, we hope it\u0027s crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s what I mean. We hope it\u0027s crap. Because it gets in the way of what BioGen\u0027s announcing, that\u0027s for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Diehl will delay the announcement?\" Tom Weller asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But Diehl doesn\u0027t like waiting. And he\u0027s been nervous ever since he got back from Vegas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh tugged on his rubber gloves, put on safety goggles and his paper face-mask, then picked up the six-inch-long compressed-air cylinder, and screwed on the vial of retrovirus. The whole apparatus was the size of a cigar tube. Next, he fitted a tiny plastic cone on top of that, pushing it in place with his thumb. \"Grab your PDA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they pushed through the swinging door, into the animal quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strong,slightly sweet odor of the rats was a familiar smell. There were five or six hundred rats here, all neatly labeled in cages stacked six feet high, on both sides of an aisle that ran down the center of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re we dosing today?\" Tom Weller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh read off a string of numbers. Tom checked his PDA listing of numerical locations. They walked down the aisle until they found the cages with that day\u0027s numbers. Five rats in five cages. The animals were white, plump, moving normally. \"They look okay. This is the second dose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, boys,\" Josh said. \"Let\u0027s be nice for Daddy.\" He opened the first cage, and quickly grabbed the rat inside. He held the animal by the body, forefingers expertly gripping the neck, and quickly fitted the small plastic cone over the rat\u0027s snout. The animal\u0027s breath clouded the cone. A brief hiss as the virus was released; Josh held the mask in place for ten seconds, while the rat inhaled. Then he released the animal back into the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom Weller tapped his stylus on the PDA, then moved to the next cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe retrovirushad been bioengineered to carry a gene known asACMPD 3N7, one of the family of genes controlling aminocarboxymuconate paraldehyde decarboxylase. Within BioGen they called it the maturity gene. When activated,ACMPD 3N7 seemed to modify responses of the amygdala and cingulate gyrus in the brain. The result was an acceleration of maturational behavior - at least in rats. Infant female rats, for example, would show precursors of maternal behavior, such as rolling feces in their cages, far earlier than usual. And BioGen had preliminary evidence for the maturational gene action in rhesus monkeys, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterest in the gene centered on a potential link to neurodegenerative disease. One school of thought argued that neurodegenerative illnesses were a result of disruptions of maturational pathways in the brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that were true - ifACMPD 3N7 were involved in, say, Alzheimer\u0027s disease, or another form of senility - then the commercial value of the gene would be enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh had moved on to the next cage and was holding the mask over the second rat when his cell phone went off. He gestured for Tom to pull it from his shirt pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeller looked at the screen. \"It\u0027s your mother,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah hell,\" Josh said. \"Take over for a minute, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joshua, whatare you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m working, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, can you stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we have an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh sighed. \"What did he do this time, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, \"but he\u0027s in jail, downtown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let Charles get him out.\" Charles Silverberg was the family lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charles is getting him out right now,\" his mother said. \"But Adam has to appear in court. Somebody has to drive him home after the hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m at work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your brother, Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s also thirty years old,\" Josh said. This had been going on for years. His brother Adam was an investment banker who had been in and out of rehab a dozen times. \"Can\u0027t he take a taxi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s wise, under the circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh sighed. \"What\u0027d he do, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently he bought cocaine from a woman who worked for the DEA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joshua. Are you going to go downtown and pick him up or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong sigh. \"Yes, Mom. I\u0027ll go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now? Will you go now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom. I\u0027ll go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped the phone shut and turned to Weller. \"What do you say we finish this in a couple of hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Tom said. \"I have some notes to write up back in the office, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua turned, stripping off his gloves as he left the room. He stuck his cylinder, goggles, and paper mask into the pocket of his lab coat, unclipped his radiation tag, and hurried to his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving downtown,he glanced at the cylinder protruding from the lab coat, which he had tossed onto the passenger seat. To stay within the protocol, Josh had to return to the lab and expose the remaining rats before five p.m. That kind of schedule and the need to keep to it seemed to represent everything that separated Josh from his older brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, Adam had had everything - looks, popularity, athletic prowess. His high school days at the elite Westfield School had consisted of one triumph after another - editor of the newspaper, soccer team captain, president of the debating team, National Merit Scholar. Josh, in contrast, had been a nerd. He was chubby, short, ungainly. He walked with a kind of waddle; he couldn\u0027t help it. The orthopedic shoes his mother insisted he wear did not help. Girls disdained him. He heard them giggle as he passed them in the hallways. High school was torture for Josh. He did not do well. Adam went to Yale. Josh barely got into Emerson State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow times had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year ago, Adam had been fired from his job at Deutsche Bank. His drug troubles were endless. Meanwhile, Josh had started at BioGen as a lowly assistant, but had quickly moved up as the company began to recognize his hard work and his inventive approach. Josh had stock in the company, and if any of the current projects, including the maturity gene, proved out commercially, then he would be rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Adam...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh pulled up in front of the courthouse. Adam was sitting on the steps, staring fixedly at the ground. His ratty suit was streaked with grime and he had a day\u0027s growth of beard. Charles Silverberg was standing over him, talking on his cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh honked the horn. Charles waved, and headed off. Adam trudged over and got in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, bro.\" He slammed the door shut. \"Appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh pulled into traffic, glancing at his watch. He had enough time to take Adam back to their mother\u0027s house and get back to the lab by five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I interrupt something?\" Adam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the annoying thing about his brother. He liked to mess up everyone else\u0027s life, too. He seemed to take pleasure in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, actually. You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry? If you were sorry, you\u0027d stop doing this shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, man,\" Adam said. \"How the fuck was I supposed to know? It was entrapment, man. Even Charles said so. The bitch entrapped me. Charles said he would get me off easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There wouldn\u0027t be any entrapment,\" Josh said, \"if you weren\u0027t using.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, go fuck yourself! Don\u0027t lecture me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh said nothing. Why did he even bring it up? After all these years, he knew nothing he said mattered. Nothing made a difference. There was a long silence as he drove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you\u0027re right,\" Adam said. \"You\u0027re right.\" He hung his head. He sighed theatrically. \"I fucked up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe repentant Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh had seen it dozens of times before. The belligerent Adam, the repentant Adam, the logical Adam, the denying Adam. Meanwhile his brother always tested positive. Every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orange light came on on the dashboard. Gas was low. He saw a station up ahead. \"I need gas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I got to take a leak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to take a leak, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay in the fucking car.\" Josh pulled up alongside the pump and got out. \"Stay where I can fucking see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to pee in your car, man...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just hold it, Adam!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh put a credit card in the slot and started pumping gas. He glanced at his brother through the rear windshield, then looked back at the spinning numbers. Gas was so damn expensive now. He probably should buy a car that was cheaper to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished and got back in the car. He glanced at Adam. His brother had a funny look on his face. There was a faint odor in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started the engine. That smell...Something silver caught his eye. He looked at the floor between his brother\u0027s feet and saw the silver cylinder. He leaned over, picked up the cylinder. It was light in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t do anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh shook the cylinder. It was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was nitrous or something,\" his brother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? It didn\u0027t do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s for a rat, Adam. You just inhaled virus for a rat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam slumped back. \"Is that bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the timeJosh pulled up in front of his mother\u0027s house in Beverly Hills, he had thought it through and concluded that there was no danger to Adam. The retrovirus was a mouse-infective strain, and while it might also infect human beings, the dose had been calculated for an animal weighing eight hundred grams. His brother weighed a hundred times as much. The genetic exposure was subclinical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I\u0027m okay?\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that,\" Adam said, getting out of the car. \"But thanks for picking me up. See you, bro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait until you get inside,\" Josh said. He watched as his brother walked up the drive and knocked on the door. His mother opened it. Adam stepped inside, and she shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never even looked at Josh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started the engine and drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 007\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon,Alex Burnet left her office in her Century City law firm and went home. She didn\u0027t have far to go; she lived in an apartment on Roxbury Park with her eight-year-old son, Jamie. Jamie had a cold and had stayed home from school. Her father was looking after him for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found her dad in the kitchen, making macaroni and cheese. It was the only thing Jamie would eat these days. \"How is he?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fever\u0027s down. Still got a runny nose and a cough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t earlier. But he asked for macaroni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good sign,\" she said. \"Should I take over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father shook his head. \"I\u0027ve got it handled. You didn\u0027t have to come home, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She paused. \"The judge issued his ruling, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father continued to stir. \"We lost everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"We lost on every point. You have no rights to your own tissue. He ruled them \u0027material waste\u0027 that you allowed the university to dispose of for you. The court says you have no rights to any of your tissue once it has left your body. The university can do what it wants with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they brought me back - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said a reasonable person would have realized the tissues were being collected for commercial use. Therefore you tacitly accepted it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they told me I was sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He rejected all our arguments, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but according to the judge, good social policy promotes medical research. Granting you rights now would have a chilling effect on future research. That\u0027s the thinking behind the ruling - the common good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t about the common good. It was about getting rich,\" her father said. \"Jesus, three billion dollars...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Dad. Universities want money. And basically, this judge held what California judges have held for the last twenty-five years, ever since the Moore decision in 1980. Just like your case, the court found that Moore\u0027s tissues were waste materials to which he had no right. And they haven\u0027t revisited that question in more than two decades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what happens now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We appeal,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think we have good grounds, but we have to do it before we can go to the California Supreme Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when will that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year from now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have a chance?\" her father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not,\"Albert Rodriguez said, turning in his chair toward her father. Rodriguez and the other UCLA attorneys had come to Alex\u0027s law offices in the aftermath of the judge\u0027s ruling. \"You have no chance on further appeal, Mr. Burnet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised,\" Alex said, \"that you\u0027re so confident about how the California Supreme Court will rule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we have no idea how they will rule,\" Rodriguez said. \"I simply mean that you will lose this case no matter what the court holds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is that?\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"UCLA is a state university. The Board of Regents is prepared, on behalf of the state of California, to take your father\u0027s cells by right of eminent domain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked:\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should the Supreme Court rule that your father\u0027s cellsare his property - which we think is unlikely - the state will take ownership of his property by eminent domain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEminent domain referred to the right of the state to take private property without the owner\u0027s consent. It was almost always invoked for public uses. \"But eminent domain is intended for schools or highways...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The state can do it in this case,\" Rodriguez said. \"And it will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father stared at them, thunderstruck. \"Are you joking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mr. Burnet. It\u0027s a legitimate taking, and the state will exercise its right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex said, \"Then what is the purpose of this meeting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought it appropriate to inform you of the situation, in case you wanted to drop further litigation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re suggesting we end litigation?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would advise it,\" Rodriguez said to her, \"if this were my client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ending litigation saves the state considerable expense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It saves everyone expense,\" Rodriguez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you proposing as a settlement, for us to drop the case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing whatever, Ms. Burnet. I\u0027m sorry if you misunderstood me. This is not a negotiation. We\u0027re simply here to explain our position, so that you can make an informed decision in your best interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father cleared his throat. \"You\u0027re telling us that you\u0027re taking my cells, no matter what. You\u0027ve sold them for three billion dollars, no matter what. And you\u0027re keeping all of that money, no matter what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bluntly put,\" Rodriguez said, \"but not inaccurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting ended. Rodriguez and his team thanked them for their time, said their good-byes, and left the room. Alex nodded to her father and then followed the other attorneys outside. Through the glass, Frank Burnet watched as they talked further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those fuckers,\" he said. \"What kind of world do we live in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sentiments exactly,\"said a voice from behind him. Burnet turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young man wearing horn-rimmed glasses was sitting in the far corner of the conference room. Burnet remembered him; he had come in during the meeting, bringing coffee and mugs, which he had put on the sideboard. Then he had sat down in the corner for the rest of the meeting. Burnet had assumed he was a junior member of the firm, but now the young man was speaking with confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s face it, Mr. Burnet,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve been screwed. It turns out your cells are very rare and valuable. They\u0027re efficient manufacturers of cytokines, chemicals that fight cancer. That\u0027s the real reason you survived your disease. As a matter of fact, your cells churn out cytokines more efficiently than any commercial process. That\u0027s why those cells are worth so much money. The UCLA doctors didn\u0027t create anything or invent anything. They didn\u0027t genetically modify anything. They just took your cells, grew them in a dish, and sold the dish to BioGen. And you, my friend, werescrewed .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" Burnet said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you have no hope of justice,\" the young man continued, \"because the courts are totally incompetent. The courts don\u0027t realize how fast things are changing. They don\u0027t understand we arealready in a new world. They don\u0027t get the new issues. And because they are technically illiterate, they don\u0027t understand what procedures are done - or in this case, not done. Your cells were stolen and sold. Plain and simple. And the court decided that was just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurnet gave a long sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" the man continued, \"thieves can still get their comeuppance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because UCLA did nothing to change your cells, another company could take those same cells, make minor genetic modifications, and sell them as a new product.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But BioGen already has my cells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. But cell lines are fragile. Things happen to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cultures are vulnerable to fungus, bacterial infection, contamination, mutation. All kinds of things can go wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BioGen must take precautions...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. But sometimes the precautions are inadequate,\" the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" Burnet said again. He was looking around, through the glass walls of the conference room, at the larger office outside. He saw people walking back and forth. He wondered where his daughter had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m nobody,\" the young man said. \"You never met me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a business card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shook his head. \"I\u0027m not here, Mr. Burnet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurnet frowned. \"And my daughter - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has no idea. Never met her. This is between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re talking about illegal activity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not talking at all, because you and I have never met,\" the man said. \"But let\u0027s consider how this might work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027tlegally sell your cells at this point, because the court has ruled you no longer own them - BioGen does. But your cells could be obtained from other places. Over the course of your life, you\u0027ve given blood many times in many places. You went to Vietnam forty years ago. The army took your blood. You had knee surgery twenty years ago in San Diego. The hospital took your blood, and kept your cartilage. You\u0027ve consulted various doctors over the years. They ran blood tests. The labs kept the blood. So your blood can be found, no problem. And it can be acquired from publicly available databases - if, for example, another company wanted to use your cells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about BioGen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man shrugged. \"Biotechnology is a difficult business. Contaminations happen every day. If something goes wrong in their labs, that\u0027s not your problem, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how could - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea. So many things can happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short silence. \"And why should I do this?\" Burnet said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get a hundred million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Punch biopsies of six organ systems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you could get my blood elsewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In theory. If it came to litigation, that would be claimed. But, in practice, any company would want fresh cells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. Think it over, Mr. Burnet.\" The young man stood, pushed his glasses up his nose. \"You may have been screwed. But there\u0027s no reason to bend over for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Beaumont CollegeAlumni News\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEM CELL DEBATE RAGES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffective Treatments \"Decades Away\" Prof. McKeown Shocks Audience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Max Thaler\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking to a packed audience in Beaumont Hall, famed biology professor Kevin McKeown shocked listeners by calling stem cell research \"a cruel fraud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you have been told is nothing more than a myth,\" he said, \"intended to ensure funding for researchers, at the expense of false hopes for the seriously ill. So let\u0027s get to the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStem cells, he explained, are cells that have the ability to turn themselves into other kinds of cells. There are two kinds of stem cells. Adult stem cells are found throughout the body. They are found in muscle, brain, and liver tissue, and so on. Adult stem cells can generate new cells, but only of the tissue in which they are found. They are important because the human body replaces all its cells every seven years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch involving adult stem cells is for the most part not controversial. But there is another kind of stem cell, the embryonic stem cell, that is highly controversial. It is found in umbilical cord blood, or derived from young embryos. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into any kind of tissue. But the research is controversial because it involves the use of human embryos, which many people feel, for religious and other reasons, have the rights of human beings. This is an old debate not likely to be resolved soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENTISTS SEE A BAN ON RESEARCH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current American administration has said that embryonic stem cells can be taken from existing research lines, but not from new embryos. Scientists regard existing lines as inadequate, and thus view the ruling a de facto ban on research. That\u0027s why they are going to private centers to carry out their research, without federal grants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the end, the real problem isn\u0027t simply a lack of stem cells. It\u0027s the fact that in order to produce therapeutic effects, scientists need each person to have his or her own pluripotent stem cells. This would allow us to regrow an organ, or to repair damage from injury or disease, or to undo paralysis. This represents the great dream. No one is able to perform these therapeutic miracles now. No one even has an inkling how it might be done. But it requires the cells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, for newborns, you can collect umbilical cord blood and freeze it, and people are doing that with their newborns. But what about adults? Where will we get pluripotent stem cells?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the big question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOWARD THE THERAPEUTIC DREAM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll we adults have left is adult stem cells, which can make only one kind of tissue. But what if there were a way to convert adult stem cells back into embryonic stem cells? Such a procedure would enable every adult to have a ready source of his or her own embryonic stem cells. That would make the therapeutic dream possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it turns out that youcan reverse adult stem cells, but only if you insert them into an egg. Something within the egg unwinds the differentiation and converts the adult stem cell back into an embryonic stem cell. This is good news, but it is vastly more difficult to do with human cells. And if the method could be made to work in human beings, it would require an enormous supply of human egg cells. That makes the procedure controversial again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo scientists are looking for other ways to make adult cells pluripotent. It is a worldwide effort. A researcher in Shanghai has been injecting human stem cells into chicken eggs, with mixed results - while others cluck in disapproval. It\u0027s not clear now whether such procedures will work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s equally unclear whether the stem cell dream - transplants without rejection, spinal cord injuries repaired, and so on - will come true. Advocates have made dishonest claims, and media speculation has been fantastical for years. People with serious illnesses have been led to believe a cure is just around the corner. Sadly, this is not true. Working therapeutic approaches lie many years in the future, perhaps decades. Many thoughtful scientists have said, in private, that we won\u0027t know whether stem cell therapy will work until 2050. They point out that it took forty years from the time Watson and Crick decoded the gene until human gene therapy began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA SCANDAL SHOCKS THE WORLD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the context of feverish hope and hype that Korean biochemist Hwang Woo-Suk announced in 2004 that he had successfully created a human embryonic stem cell from an adult cell by somatic nuclear transfer - injection into a human egg. Hwang was a famous workaholic, spending eighteen hours a day, seven days a week, in the lab. Hwang\u0027s exciting report was published in March 2005 inScience magazine. Researchers from around the world flocked to Korea. Human stem cell treatment seemed suddenly on the verge of reality. Hwang was a hero in Korea, and appointed to head a new World Stem Cell Hub, financed by the Korean government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in November 2005, an American collaborator in Pittsburgh announced that he was ending his association with Hwang. And then one of Hwang\u0027s co-workers revealed that Hwang had obtained eggs illegally, from women who worked in his lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy December 2005, Seoul National University announced that Hwang\u0027s cell lines were a fabrication, as were his papers inScience. Science retracted the papers. Hwang now faces criminal charges. There the matter stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePERILS OF \"MEDIA HYPE\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What lessons can be drawn from this?\" asked Professor McKeown. \"First, in a media-saturated world, persistent hype lends unwarranted credulity to the wildest claims. For years the media have touted stem cell research as the coming miracle. So when somebody announced that the miracle had arrived, he was believed. Does that imply there is a danger in media hype? You bet. Because not only does it raise cruel hopes among the ill, it affects scientists, too. They start to believe the miracle is around the corner - even though they should know better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can we do about media hype? It would stop in a week, if scientific institutions wanted that. They don\u0027t. They love the hype. They know it brings grants. So that won\u0027t change. Yale, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins promote hype just as much as Exxon or Ford. So do individual researchers at those institutions. And increasingly, researchers and universities are all commercially motivated, just like corporations. So whenever you hear a scientist claim that his statements have been exaggerated, or taken out of context, just ask him if he has written a letter of protest to the editor. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, he hasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next lesson: Peer review. All of Hwang\u0027s papers inScience were peer-reviewed. If we ever needed evidence that peer review is an empty ritual, this episode provides it. Hwang made extraordinary claims. He did not provide extraordinary evidence. Many studies have shown that peer review does not improve the quality of scientific papers. Scientists themselves know it doesn\u0027t work. Yet the public still regards it as a sign of quality, and says, \u0027This paper was peer-reviewed,\u0027 or \u0027This paper was not peer-reviewed,\u0027 as if that meant something. It doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next, the journals themselves. Where was the firm hand of the editor ofScience ? Remember that the journalScience is a big enterprise - 115 people work on that magazine. Yet gross fraud, including photographs altered with Adobe Photoshop, were not detected. And Photoshop is widely known as a major tool of scientific fraud. Yet the magazine had no way to detect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not thatScience is unique in being fooled. Fraudulent research has been published in theNew England Journal of Medicine, where authors withheld critical information about Vioxx heart attacks; in theLancet, where a report about drugs and oral cancer was entirely fabricated - in that one, 250 people in the patient database had the same birth date! That might have been a clue. Medical fraud is more than a scandal, it\u0027s a public health threat. Yet it continues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE COST OF FRAUD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cost of such fraud is enormous,\" McKeown said, \"estimated at thirty billion dollars annually, probably three times that. Fraud in science is not rare, and it\u0027s not limited to fringe players. The most respected researchers and institutions have been caught with faked data. Even Francis Collins, the head of NIH\u0027s Human Genome Project, was listed as co-author on five faked papers that had to be withdrawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ultimate lesson is that science isn\u0027t special - at least not anymore. Maybe back when Einstein talked to Niels Bohr, and there were only a few dozen important workers in every field. But there are now three million researchers in America. It\u0027s no longer a calling, it\u0027s a career. Science is as corruptible a human activity as any other. Its practitioners aren\u0027t saints, they\u0027re human beings, and they do what human beings do - lie, cheat, steal from one another, sue, hide data, fake data, overstate their own importance, and denigrate opposing views unfairly. That\u0027s human nature. It isn\u0027t going to change.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/next/page-4.html","bookId":1713,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:14 AM"}
