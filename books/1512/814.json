He gave a silent look towards Zhengs’ battlefield, before turning his head toward the southeast. A black speck was fast approaching from afar. With Yinglong’s eyesight, he could tell it was the enormous organic weapon… the Eva Unit-01.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Wangxia. You all have to make sure Zheng’s battle isn’t interfered with. No matter what happens, you have to ensure it even if you have to risk or gamble your lives. Remember, remember! Otherwise, we won’t have a chance to live.” Yinglong quickly transmitted a few lines to Wangxia and the rest, before standing up. He raised a single finger, manipulating the flying sword towards the Eva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe two were incredibly fast, and Yinglong was already a few hundred meters away from the Eva in the blink of an eye. He rubbed his hands together, and sword light densely engulfed the Eva. Although it was immediately blocked by the A.T. Field, the Eva was still forced to a stop. When the azure light was finally dissipated by the A.T. Field, the two sides entered a face-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“YOU AGAIN! LUO YINGLONG! What relationship does team China have with you? Are you trying to block me again? Do you really want to die so much?” Gando had eaten Adam’s Light of the Soul. It wasn’t any ordinary Light of the Soul, but the ultimate product of the Human Instrumentality Project, the ultimate Light of the Soul. It couldn’t be denied that Gando’s luck was very good. The initial stages of the Human Instrumentality Project had been heavily sabotaged, and became incomplete. When Adam had attempted to absorb the Light of the Soul of the surrounding people to become complete, who would have expected team China had laid down a good scheme and Zero had landed an attack on him. Although he hadn’t died, he had ended up at his absolute weakest. With only his Light of the Soul remaining, he had been eaten by the Eva. Adam really had died a wrongful death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eGando really had benefited. Even feeble, it was still the Light of the Soul of the ultimate lifeform. That ball of Light of the Soul represented an infinite source of energy to the Eva, a copy of God. It allowed the Eva to become invulnerable. It would still regenerate indefinitely as long as a single cell wasn’t destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“I’ll really be wanting to die if I didn’t stop you…” Yinglong snickered, before continuing seriously, “You and I are chess pieces. Why must we fight until both sides are hurt? Why not we stop and wait for the Zhengs to end their fight? Don’t all of you team Devil firmly believe that clone Zheng is peerless? So why not just quietly watch their battle?” There was still this very unlikely thought in Yinglong’s mind. He intended to borrow Gando’s trust in clone Zheng to delay this battle that would lead to his death. Perhaps this could let him overcome this fatal disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Shut up!” Gando instead began to rave madly, “You think I just want to win? No! What I want is revenge! Revenge with my own power and hands! I’ll repay the entire team China! Why do I have to wait for victory ro be decided? Killing Zheng myself is precisely what I want to do! \u0026nbsp;Extermination is the only end for a team of hypocrites like them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Is that so?” Yinglong sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“That\u0027s fine! I\u0027ll kill you and then exterminate team China, starting with that hypocrite Zheng!” Gando began to roar with insanity again. He had sunk into the heart’s devil ever since merging with the Eva. His condition before could be just described as rampaging, while his own insanity wasn’t displayed. However, his consciousness had awakened after eating Adam, that madness had intensified. Upon seeing Yinglong blocking the way and declaring war, he didn’t hesitate to roar and unleash a punch. The two were separated by hundred of meters, but the fist carried with it countless diamond shaped A.T Fields, transparent but material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eYinglong knew that it was impressive and that an A.T. Fields was one of the top tier forms of Light of the Soul. It could both attack and defend, with unfathomable power. You wouldn’t even see one person out of millions or tens of millions of people awaken an A.T. Field, an indication of how terrifying it was. Yinglong didn’t dare be negligent, as the flying sword below his feet shot out abruptly to welcome the A.T. Field, while he himself remained levitating there. As expected, a fierce shockwave travelled over, its might feeling like a miniature nuke’s. Yinglong’s heart sunk. Just this violent explosion had expended ten percent of his Refined Qi. It was obvious how powerful it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eFortunately, he had laid down the Omnidirectional Samsara Formation, which replenished his Refined Qi within a few breaths as it operated. The flying sword returned to his side, revolving around his body like a strip of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“It’s impressive indeed. As expected of the ultimate battle power that ‘he’ arranged.” Yinglong let out a breath as he suddenly recalled what had happened a while back when he had been cultivating at Zu Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Yinglong, do you know why master called you over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“No. Does master have any instructions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“True. Ever since master accepted you as my disciples, your senior brothers have been passing the skills on to you in place of master. Apart from meeting you that time I gave you the Cauldron of the Eight Trigrams, master hasn’t met you. Yinglong, do you feel as if master has been treating you coldly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“No, disciple had never ever felt as if…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Listen carefully, Yinglong. Although you’re an outsider not of this world, master has always treated you genuinely. But in the end you’re not of this world, so there’ll still be a day you leave. That’s why master doesn’t want to meet you too much, to prevent the eventual heartbreak… But your talents are still extraordinary. You’re far from reaching master’s level, and yet you can already sense the Heavenly Dao. That’s why master called you over…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Destiny?

The Grand Dao is invisible and the Heavenly Dao dispassionate. Who can fathom its will? In the entire Zu Mountain, no, the entire Cultivation world, those who know ‘he’ exists number merely two or three. But you all from outside have different talents, and are able to able to possibly sense ‘him’ while you are still weak. That’s why master wants you to remember this. Never defy the heavens. No matter how much you outsiders know, no matter if you have methods to break out of the heavens, you still can’t defy the heavens. No matter how strong you are, it’ll still come to naught and ashes. Yinglong, if you’re willing to let go of the outside world, master, along with a few ancient elders who haven\u0027t died yet, is willing to help you sever your karma with the outside world. With your talents, you’ll become an immortal in fifty years at best, a hundred years at worst.

No. Master, disciple still had countless fetters there. It can’t be severed, nor reasoned out. Disciple will not run. Disciple will risk it even if I really do have to defy the heavens.
