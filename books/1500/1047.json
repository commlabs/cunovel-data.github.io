She instinctively wanted to avoid that limitless darkness, yet couldn’t suppress her innermost curiosity either. She knew that this curiosity was extremely abnormal, as if that darkness possessed some intangible attraction force that wanted to forcefully pull her in. Moreover, when she truly stood before the darkness, she felt a bit of a suffocating feeling, an instinctive fear one felt towards a giant space that exceeded the limits of one’s imagination.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Mama?” Snow cried out softly. She felt extremely cold, urgently needing warmth, and as such, she forcefully leaned towards Helen’s body. However, Helen’s body wasn’t as warm as before, instead extremely cold, difficult for even Snow who could easily resist temperatures reaching negative 200 degrees to withstand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Mama?!” Snow cried out with extreme anxiety. She couldn’t help but put a few steps between herself and Helen to avoid being injured by Helen’s body temperature. After hearing Helen’s story, Snow just felt a mysterious sense of uneasy, as if something was about to happen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen didn\u0027t reply. She was not only ice-cold, there was darkness that continuously spread from her as well, gradually extending out, even wrapping Snow within. This type of darkness was actually a bit similar to the Lord Snow saw in the dream. Snow was extremely alarmed, continuously backing up, wishing to avoid the entrapment of the darkness. She didn’t understand why her mother’s body would suddenly release this type of aura. In the dream, that Lord always hid in the darkness, never revealing itself, but its power made all ultra life forms tremble. Snow was also an ultra life form, even though she was still young, it didn’t stop her from sensing the might of the Lord. It was because due to some unknown reason, her perception was much sharper than those of other ultra life forms, able to truly perceive all of this imposing might. Meanwhile, many ultra life forms in that civilizations were completely ignorant, only feeling it after breaking through the apostles’ blockade after risking it all. All ultra life forms who arrived before the darkness immediately lost all ability to move, dragged into the depths of the darkness while in despair just like that, from then on disappearing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSnow continuously backed off, accidentally kicking over something.

Snow turned around, discovering that what was overturned was an old-fashioned little metal box. Right now, the case’s lid was opened, the inside empty, whatever was stored within already gone without a trace. This metal box looked familiar, and it similarly carried a faint frightening aura. Snow stared at it with great shock, trying to recall what this box stored with difficulty. Right at this time, Helen looked at a test tube in her hands that was already empty, and then released a silent sigh. What was stored within this test tube was the perfect body, meanwhile now, that ice-cold liquid already entered Helen’s body, immediately displaying frightening vitality, quickly covering Helen’s entire body. Then, their presence completely disappeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe perfect body couldn’t escape Helen’s surveillance. She understood every corner of her body absolutely clearly, knowing that this perfect body had already broken down into extremely fine particles, seeping into every one of her cells. When needed, they would awaken, from then on seize authority over Helen’s body. At that time, they would use their own methods to grant Helen incomparable power, after all, their host was extremely important for them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen’s finger gently loosened, the transparent test tube slowly sliding down. It bounced off her leg, then tumbled about, drawing out an arc before shattering on the ground. It didn’t shatter into many small fragments, instead directly melting into a pile of fine powder. The temperature around Helen’s body already made it extremely brittle. Helen sat there without moving, only bringing her hand before her eyes, staring at it. Her hand was extremely beautiful, her skin smooth like ice, translucent to the point where blue blood vessels could be seen. Right now, the blood within her blood vessels was surging, endless energy currently appearing out of nowhere in her blood, and then delivered to every part of her body. The body of Helen who originally didn’t have any abilities was completely mobilized, all of her potential immediately unearthed. In an instant, countless evolutionary points were produced from every part of her body, waiting for further orders. Every single evolutionary point was screened, close to a thousand of the evolutionary points, what Helen originally kept within the depths of her body in reserve, originating from her own body’s remodeling. Meanwhile, even more evolutionary points had never existed before, originating from apostle’s genes and perfect body’s contributions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eEven though she had some idea, this amount of evolutionary points was still beyond Helen’s expectations. Her brain instantly passed over countless ability pairing plans, filtering out the optimal one shortly afterwards, and then as if a flame was lit below a pot, her entire body began to frantically recombine. The recombination process was intense and painful, but Helen watched everything with a blank expression, as if it wasn’t her own body at all. Hidden within her ordinary expression was an undetectable trace of regret.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhen Helen stood up, the ice-cold and beautiful exterior remained, but the inside of her body already had nothing to do with a human’s. The icy-coldness, with her at the center, began to spread in all directions, also startling Snow who was currently examining the metal box. Snow raised her head, when she saw Helen, she was immediately given a fright. She could obviously tell that her mother had already completely changed, becoming a bit similar to the Lord in that dream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen dispersed the coldness in her body’s surroundings, and then waved in Snow’s direction. Snow immediately ran over to Helen’s side, standing up to look at Helen like a cute kitten. Helen squatted, gently stroked Snow’s head, and then said, “The Lord is just like us, all of us ultra life forms. However, there is one part in which it is different from us, which is that ultra life forms are still life forms, our lives have an end, our bodies have flaws. However, the lord isn’t like this, it has no limit, and no flaws. At the very least, with our current level, we cannot see its limits.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSnow nodded her head in a somewhat confused manner, not really understanding Helen’s words. Her thought centers were operating extremely slowly right now, mainly because of the faint pressure Helen continuously released from her body. While surrounded by this type of aura, all of her body’s functions couldn’t help but be seriously restricted. This was the most primitive type of biological instinct, giving up all resistance and thoughts of escape before an unparalleled predator, using this to obtain just a sliver of chance at survival.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eRight at this time, an ice-cold and deep voice suddenly sounded in the darkness, the faint allure of the voice so powerful it almost sucked one’s soul in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“The Lord is without limit, while we still have some flaws.” She said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen was already standing perfectly straight, every strand of her wavy long blonde hair flickering with a dazzling radiance, a powerful loftiness spreading from her body, the formless might containing incomparable power, pushing Snow who was far out aside. The temperature in Helen’s surroundings dropped greatly. She was like a black hole herself, absorbing all of the energy around her. Everything in the laboratory was dyed in a strange ash gray, even the slightest shaking able to crush everything. Just when everything in the laboratory was on the verge of collapse, a stream of blazing heat surged, piercing through Helen’s frozen domain with unstoppable power, bringing chaos to this ice-cold and quiet realm. Only, when the streak of fire rushed to a meter around Helen, it couldn’t approach any further. Even though it already occupied the entire laboratory, it just couldn’t overcome this last meter of barricades.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSnow continuously backed up. Even though she felt unwilling, she still gave Helen a deep look in the end, and then turned around to run into the distance. The fire stream was different from the icy coldness, it was extremely detrimental to her, and Helen already warned her again and again about what to do, who she needs to look for. At this critical moment, Snow knew that it wasn’t the time to do something foolish.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhen she saw Snow leave safely, Helen’s pupils became even deeper. She stared in the direction where the flame stream came from, and then said calmly, “Spider Empress, you could not resist the allure of power either?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-13\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-15\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-14","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
