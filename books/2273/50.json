He checked out the downstairs, and when he reached the kitchen, he saw her purse and phone lying in the counter. He ran down into the basement, but it was empty, then raced up the stairs and through the bedrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried the attic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurtled down the stairs again, then stopped short, staring, sure he was dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA host of people were standing in the foyer as if they’d been waiting for him forever, their clothing elegant and their eyes sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne woman stepped forward. She was extremely beautiful, with translucent blue eyes, and she looked at him sympathetically as she reached for him. And even though he could see through her, he felt her gentle touch on his face as she directed his attention to the ladies’ parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked closer and saw drag marks through the plaster dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned down…and examined a series of smudges, realizing that they spelled out words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erebel cemetery gun kill you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and raced for his car, his phone already to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah slowly came to. She was lying in a cemetery, and as soon as she looked around, she knew which one. It was a very old one and had served the outlying farms. Rebel soldiers were buried here, along with Spanish homesteaders and British immigrants. There was even a mound marking the final resting place of some of the Yankees who had died at the battle of Olustee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was lying on an old stone sarcophagus, and she was vaguely aware of voices droning in the background. She tested her muscles and realized that she could move—just a little bit, but at least she was no longer totally paralyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to turn her head toward the voices and blinked, sure she must be hallucinating, then realizing that this was all too real. She saw two figures in hooded capes, one holding a massive bowl, the other a huge curved knife with elaborate engraving along the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words…they were chanting were a mixture of English, French and something else she didn’t recognize. Maybe Spanish. Maybe Creole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For blood is life!” one of them cried as they lifted the bowl and knife toward the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Renee? she wondered. Had they already killed her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly one of the figures moved closer and loomed over her. From the size, she realized it was Gary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s do it,” Caroline said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not yet. I want to play with her,” Gary said, tossing back his hood as he leaned down, staring at Sarah in fascination. He smiled cruelly. “Her eyes are open. She sees me. Or maybe a dragon. Or a monster. Maybe a giant wolf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gary, get away from her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary flashed Caroline an angry look. “I get to play with the girls first, because I am the god. That’s what it says in the book.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not her,” Caroline insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially her,” Gary said. “I love her. I’ve always loved her. But she never loved me. Never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get away from her, Gary. We have to hurry. What’s the matter with you? She has to die, and we have to be ready when Caleb gets here—we have to kill him and then mess me up so it looks like he tried to kill me, too. Get smart, Gary, come on,” Caroline urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up! Give me a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched Sarah’s face, and she tried not to twitch. She couldn’t let him know that she was starting to be able to move, because she needed the element of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might have only one chance of saving herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb drew his car up in the shelter of the trees outside the cemetery wall and killed the motor. He got out and scaled the wall, dropping silently to the ground and moving carefully between the old headstones until he could see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary was bending down over a weathered sarcophagus, with a knife in his hand as he stared intently at Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr Sarah’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline was standing beneath a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Renee?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around and he saw a burlap bag bulging with…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenee’s body. Dead or alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held still for a long moment, watching, judging his distance. Wondering how far behind him the police cars were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, to his amazement, he saw…himself. No, not himself. Cato. Running toward Gary and Caroline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s him!” Caroline shrieked. “Shoot him, Gary! Shoot him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary straightened, dropping the knife as he pulled a gun from under his robe and started to fire. His aim was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no way to shoot a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb counted the shots, then leapt to his feet when he reached six and made a beeline toward the action. Gary took aim again. At him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew his own weapon as Caroline let out a shriek of pure fury and went racing toward Sarah, grabbing the knife off the ground as she ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb’s shot took Gary down. He had aimed to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Caroline was on top of Sarah, knife raised. Suddenly Sarah lashed out with her legs, catching Caroline in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline flew backward, slammed into a tall headstone, then fell forward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight on the knife she had meant to use on Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blood sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was days before everything began to untangle and the full truth came out. The police reached the cemetery moments after Caroline’s death, leading to hours of interrogation for Sarah and Caleb, while Renee, who this time didn’t regain consciousness for hours, made her second trip to the hospital in twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the station, Jamison had the grace to apologize and then fell silent. Then there was the process of trying to understand what had triggered Caroline’s insanity, even as Sarah, stunned, grieved for the loss of her best friend, a friend she now realized she had never really known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they put the pieces together, Caroline’s MO began to emerge. She had lived with her parents, so every night, after Will saw her home, she had turned around and gone back out to meet Gary. It would always be impossible to know for sure, but apparently they’d started dabbling in black magic years earlier. At first it had been a lark, a fun way to scare themselves, but somewhere along the way they’d started to take it seriously, and their murderous rampage had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while there was no way to prove it—and in fact, Sarah would never even consider trying, since she had no desire to be branded insane—Sarah suspected that maybe the insanity that drove them had been a result of the original Martha Tyler’s curse. How else to explain not only their actions but those of the forever unidentified killer who had murdered Mr. Griffin’s daughter and the other missing girls back in the 1920s?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was gone over with a fine-tooth comb, and Jennie Lawson’s body was found buried beneath the stack of crates in the basement. And because Caroline had been so determined to emulate Martha Tyler, she had left behind a book of her own, which her parents found in her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Gary had killed Frederick Russell when he had found them trying to stuff a drugged Jennie Lawson into Greg’s truck, then come up with the idea of sending both him and his car to the bottom of the bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the DNA match, Caleb was able to claim the body of Eleanora Stewart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill was stunned. He had never suspected that Caroline had a secret life, and he seemed ready to wallow in his misery for the foreseeable future. But then Cary offered her shoulder, and Sarah didn’t think it would take long for them to do more than commiserate together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen days after the events in the cemetery, Sarah and Caleb headed to Virginia, where they traced the grave of Cato MacTavish and saw Eleanora laid to rest next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was never entirely sure that she wasn’t dreaming, but she could have sworn she saw the two of them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot at the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she woke in the middle of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were standing at the foot of the bed, arm in arm, looking down at her and Caleb with approving smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb moved slightly, reaching to take her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they faded gently away, and Sarah had the feeling that she would never see them again but that there would be others like them in her future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb edged closer to her, his body like a sleek spoon against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My love,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, filled with the sense that so long as she was in his arms, she was exactly where she was supposed to be. She didn’t know what the future would hold, if they would set up housekeeping in Virginia or move back to St. Augustine, or go somewhere else entirely, and she realized with complete serenity that it didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever they did now, they would do together, and that was all that mattered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unhallowed-ground-harrison-investigation-7/page-50.html","bookId":2273,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:47 PM"}
