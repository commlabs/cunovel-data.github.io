He saw himself behind the counter at Seven-Eleven, bagging microwave burritos and pumping Slush-Puppies. It was obvious that the suspect, Robert Masterson, was telling the truth. What was worse was that he not only didn\u0027t have any connection with the marijuana Rivera\u0027s men had found in the trailer, but he didn\u0027t have the slightest idea where The Breeze had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deputy district attorney, an officious little weasel who was only putting time in at the D.A.\u0027s office until his fangs were sharp enough for private practice, had made the state\u0027s position on the case clear and simple: \"You\u0027re fucked, Rivera. Cut him loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera was clinging to a single, micro-thin strand of hope: the second suitcase, the one that Masterson had made such a big deal about back at the trailer. It lay open on Rivera\u0027s desk. A jumble of notebook paper, cocktail napkins, matchbook covers, old business cards, and candy wrappers stared out of the suitcase at him. On each one was written a name, an address, and a date. The dates were obviously bogus, as they went back to the 1920s. Rivera had riffled through the mess a dozen times without making any sort of connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Perez approached Rivera\u0027s desk. He was doing his best to affect an attitude of sympathy, without much success. Everything he had said that morning had carried with it a sideways smirk. Twain had put it succinctly: \"Never underestimate the number of people who would love to see you fail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find anything yet?\" Perez asked. The smirk was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera looked up from the papers, took out a cigarette, and lit it. A long stream of smoke came out with his sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see how any of this connects with The Breeze. The addresses are spread all over the country. The dates run too far back to be real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s a list of connections The Breeze was planning to dump the pot on,\" Perez suggested. \"You know the Feds estimate that more than ten percent of the drugs in this country move through the postal system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the dates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some kind of code, maybe. Did the handwriting check out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera had sent Perez back to the trailer to find a sample of The Breeze\u0027s handwriting. He had returned with a list of engine parts for a Ford truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No match,\" Rivera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe the list was written by his connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera blew a blast of smoke in Perez\u0027s face. \"Think about it, dipshit. I was his connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, someone blew your cover, and The Breeze ran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t he take the pot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Sergeant. I\u0027m just a uniformed deputy. This sounds like detective work to me.\" Perez had stopped trying to hide his smirk. \"I\u0027d take it to the Spider if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made a consensus. Everyone who had seen or heard about the suitcase had suggested that Rivera take it to the Spider. He sat back in his chair and finished his cigarette, enjoying his last few moments of peace before the inevitable confrontation with the Spider. After a few long drags he stubbed the cigarette in the ashtray on his desk, gathered the papers into the suitcase, closed it, and started down the steps into the bowels of the station and the Spider\u0027s lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout his life Rivera had known half a dozen men nicknamed Spider. Most were tall men with angular features and the wiry agility that one associates with a wolf spider. Chief Technical Sergeant Irving Nailsworth was the exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNailsworth stood five feet nine inches tall and weighed over three hundred pounds. When he sat before his consoles in the main computer room of the San Junipero Sheriff Department, he was locked into a matrix that extended not only throughout the county but to every state capital in the nation, as well as to the main computer banks at the FBI and the Justice Department in Washington. The matrix was the Spider\u0027s web and he lorded over it like a fat black widow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Rivera opened the steel door that led into the computer room, he was hit with a blast of cold, dry air. Nailsworth insisted the computers functioned better in this environment, so the department had installed a special climate control and filtration system to accommodate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera entered and, suppressing a shudder, closed the door behind him. The computer room was dark except for the soft green glow of a dozen computer screens. The Spider sat in the middle of a horseshoe of keyboards and screens, his huge buttocks spilling over the sides of a tiny typist\u0027s chair. Beside him a steel typing table was covered with junk food in various stages of distress, mostly cupcakes covered with marshmallow and pink coconut. While Rivera watched, the Spider peeled the marshmallow cap off a cupcake and popped it in his mouth. He threw the chocolate-cake insides into a wastebasket atop a pile of crumpled tractor-feed paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the sedentary nature of the Spider\u0027s job, the department had excused him from the minimum physical fitness standards set for field officers. The department had also created the position of chief technical sergeant in order to feed the Spider\u0027s ego and keep him happily clicking away at the keyboards. The Spider had never gone on patrol, never arrested a suspect, never even qualified on the shooting range, yet after only four years with the department, Nailsworth effectively held the same rank that Rivera had attained in fifteen years on the street. It was criminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider looked up. His eyes were sunk so far into his fat face that Rivera could see only a beady green glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You smell of smoke,\" the Spider said. \"You can\u0027t smoke in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not here to smoke, I need some help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider checked the data spooling across his screens, then turned his full attention to Rivera. Bits of pink coconut phosphoresced on the front of his uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been working up in Pine Cove, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A narcotics sting.\" Rivera held up the suitcase. \"We found this. It\u0027s full of names and addresses, but I can\u0027t make any connections. I thought you might...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" the Spider said. \"The Nailgun will find an opening where there was none.\" The Spider had given himself the nickname \"Nailgun.\" No one called him the Spider to his face, and no one called him Nailgun unless they needed something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Rivera said, \"I thought it needed some of the Nailgun\u0027s wizardry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider swept the junk food from the top of the typing table into the wastebasket and patted the top of the table. \"Let\u0027s see what you have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera placed the suitcase on the table and opened it. The Spider immediately began to shuffle through the papers, picking up a piece here or there, reading it, and throwing it back into the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll need to put this into the system to make any sense of it. I can\u0027t use a scanner on handwritten material. You\u0027ll have to read it to me while I input.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider turned to one of his keyboards and began typing. \"Give me a second to set up a data base format.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as Rivera was concerned, the Spider could be speaking Swahili. Despite himself, Rivera admired the man\u0027s efficiency and expertise. His fat fingers were a blur on the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter thirty seconds of furious typing the Spider paused. \"Okay, read me the names, addresses, and dates, in that order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you need me to sort them out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The machine will do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera began to read the names and addresses from each slip of paper, deliberately pausing so as not to get ahead of the Spider\u0027s typing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faster, Rivera. You won\u0027t get ahead of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera read faster, throwing each paper on the floor as he finished with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faster,\" the Spider demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go any faster. At this speed if I mispronounce a name, I could lose control and get a serious tongue injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since Rivera had known him the Spider laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a break, Rivera. I get so used to working with machines that I forget people have limitations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on here?\" Rivera said. \"Is the Nailgun losing his sarcastic edge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider looked embarrassed. \"No. I wanted to ask you about something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera was shocked. The Spider was almost omniscient, or so he pretended. This was a day for firsts. \"What do you need?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider blushed. Rivera had never seen that much flaccid flesh change color. He imagined that it put an incredible strain on the Spider\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been working in Pine Cove, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever run into a girl up there named Roxanne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera thought for a moment, then said no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" The Spider\u0027s voice had taken on a tone of desperation. \"It\u0027s probably a nickname. She works at the Rooms-R-Us Motel. I\u0027ve run the name against Social Security records, credit reports, everything. I can\u0027t seem to find her. There are over ten thousand women in California with the name Roxanne, but none of them check out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you just drive up to Pine Cove and meet her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spider\u0027s color deepened. \"I couldn\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? What\u0027s the deal with this woman, anyway? Does it have to do with a case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s... it\u0027s a personal thing. We\u0027re in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve never met her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes, sort of\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; we talk by modem every night. Last night she didn\u0027t log on. I\u0027m worried about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nailsworth, are you telling me that you are having a love affair with a woman by computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more than an affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you could just check on her. See if she\u0027s all right. But she can\u0027t know I sent you. You mustn\u0027t tell her I sent you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nailsworth, I\u0027m an undercover cop. Being sneaky is what I do for a living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can find something in these names that will bail me out, I\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Rivera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s finish this.\" Rivera picked up a matchbook and read the name and address. The Spider typed the information, but as Rivera began to read the next name, he heard the Spider pause on the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\" Rivera asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one more thing,\" Nailsworth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you find out if she\u0027s modeming someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Santa Maria, Nailsworth! You are a real person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hours later Rivera was sitting at his desk waiting for a call from the Spider. While he was in the computer room, someone had left a dog-eared paperback on his desk. Its title was You Can Have a Career in Private Investigation. Rivera suspected Perez. He had thrown the book in the wastebasket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with his only suspect back out on the street and nothing forthcoming from the Spider, Rivera considered fishing the book out of the trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and Rivera ripped it from its cradle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rivera,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rivera, it\u0027s the Nailgun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you find something?\" Rivera fumbled for a cigarette from the pack on his desk. He found it impossible to talk on the phone without smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I have a connection, but it doesn\u0027t work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be cryptic, Nailsworth. I need something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, first I ran the names through the Social Security computer. Most of them are deceased. Then I noticed that they were all vets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vietnam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"World War One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They were all World War One vets, and all of them had a first or middle initial E. I should have caught that before I even input it. I tried to run a correlation program on that and came up with nothing. Then I ran the addresses to see if there was a geographical connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. For a minute I thought you\u0027d found someone\u0027s research project on World War One, but just to be sure, I ran the file through the new data bank set up by the Justice Department in Washington. They use it to find criminal patterns where there aren\u0027t any. In effect it makes the random logical. They use it to track serial killers and psychopaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you found nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly. The files at the Justice Department only go back thirty years, so that eliminated about half of the names on your list. But the other ones rang the bell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nailsworth, please try to get to the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In each of the cities listed in your file there was at least one unexplained disappearance around the date listed\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; not the vets; other people. You can eliminate the large cities as coincidence, but hundreds of these disappearances were in small towns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People disappear in small towns too. They run away to the city. They drown. You can\u0027t call that a connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d say that, so I ran a probability program to get the odds on all of this being coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" Rivera was getting tired of Nailsworth\u0027s dramatics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the odds of someone having a file of the dates and locations of unexplained disappearances over the last thirty years and it being a coincidence is ten to the power of fifty against.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means, about the same odds as you\u0027d have of dragging the wreck of the Titanic out of a trout stream with a fly rod. Which means, Rivera, you have a serious problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you telling me that this suitcase belongs to a serial killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very old serial killer. Most serial killers don\u0027t even start until their thirties. If we assume that this one was cooperative enough to start when the Justice Department\u0027s files start, thirty years ago, he\u0027d be over sixty now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it goes farther back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I picked some dates and locations randomly, going back as far as 1925. I called the libraries in the towns and had them check the newspapers for stories of disappearances. It checked out. Your man could be in his nineties. Or it could be a son carrying on his father\u0027s work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible. There must be another explanation. Come on, Nailsworth, I need a bailout here. I can\u0027t pursue an investigation of a geriatric serial killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it could be an elaborate research project that someone is doing on missing persons, but that doesn\u0027t explain the World War One vets, and it doesn\u0027t explain why the researcher would write the information on matchbook covers and business cards from places that have been out of business for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\" Rivera felt as if he were stuck in the Spider\u0027s web and was waiting to be eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears that the notes themselves were written as far back as fifty years ago. I could send them to the lab to confirm it if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Don\u0027t do that.\" Rivera didn\u0027t want it confirmed. He wanted it to go away. \"Nailsworth, isn\u0027t possible that the computer is making some impossible connections? I mean, it\u0027s programmed to find patterns\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; maybe it went overboard and made this one up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the odds, Sergeant. The computer can\u0027t make anything up; it can only interpret what\u0027s put into it. If I were you, I\u0027d pull my suspect out of holding and find out where he got the suitcase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cut him loose. The D.A. said I didn\u0027t have enough to charge him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find him,\" Nailsworth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera resented the authoritarian tone in Nailsworth\u0027s voice, but he let it go. \"I\u0027m going now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of your addresses was in Pine Cove. You want it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNailsworth read the name and address to Rivera, who wrote it down on a memo pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no date on this one, Sergeant. Your killer might still be in the area. If you get him, it would be the bailout you\u0027re looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too fantastic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t forget to check on Roxanne for me, okay?\" The Spider hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJENNY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had arrived at work a half hour late expecting to find Howard waiting behind the counter to reprimand her in his own erudite way. Strangely enough, she didn\u0027t care. Even more strange was the fact that Howard had not shown up at the cafe all morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that she had drunk two bottles of wine, eaten a heavy Italian meal and everything in the refrigerator, and stayed up all night making love, she should have been tired, but she wasn\u0027t. She felt wonderful, full of humor and energy, and not a little excited. When she thought of her night with Travis, she grinned and shivered. There should be guilt, she thought. She was, technically, a married woman. Technically, she was having an illicit affair. But she had never been very technically minded. Instead of guilt she felt happy and eager to do it all again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the moment she got to work she began counting the hours until she got off after the lunch shift. She was at one hour and counting when the cook announced that there was a call for her in the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickly refilled her customer\u0027s coffee cups and headed to the back. If it was Robert, she would just act like nothing had happened. She wasn\u0027t exactly in love with someone else as he suspected. It was... it didn\u0027t matter what it was. She didn\u0027t have to explain anything. If it was Travis\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; she hoped it was Travis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the phone. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny?\" It was a woman\u0027s voice. \"It\u0027s Rachel. Look, I\u0027m having a special ritual this afternoon at the caves. I need you to be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer did not want to go to a ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Rachel, I have plans after work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jennifer, this is the most important thing we\u0027ve ever done, and I need you to be there. What time do you get off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m off at two, but I need to go home and change first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t do that. Come as you are\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; it\u0027s really important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I really...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Jenny. It will only take a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had never heard Rachel sound so adamant. Maybe it really was important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I guess I can make it. Do you need me to call any of the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll do it. You just be at the caves as soon as you can after two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine, I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Jenny\"\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; Rachel\u0027s voice had lowered an octave\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; \"don\u0027t tell anyone where you are going.\" Rachel hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer immediately dialed her home phone and got the answering machine. \"Travis, if you\u0027re there, pick up.\" She waited. He was probably still sleeping. \"I\u0027m going to be a little late. I\u0027ll be home later this afternoon.\" She almost said, \"I love you,\" but decided not to. She pushed the thought out of her mind. \"Bye,\" she said, and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if she could only avoid Robert until she could think of a way to destroy his hope for their reconciliation. Returning to the floor of the cafe, she realized that somewhere along the way her feeling of well-being had vanished and she felt very tired. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/practical-demonkeeping/page-14.html","bookId":2045,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:50 PM"}
