We need a solid plan though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, \"It\u0027s a long walk, we can plan along the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks like he might strangle me, \"When have we heard that before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneer, \"Well, it\u0027s what\u0027s happening. We sleep tonight and leave tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"I\u0027ll tell the savages that I am taking you out of here. We leave at sunrise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hits me, \"You acted like you weren’t on my side!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licks his lips, \"I needed answers. Better for them to think I was with them.\" He turns and walks away. I don’t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake hugs me tighter, \"We need to get outta here, Em. We should leave tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull away, looking up into his beautiful blue eyes, \"You don’t trust him do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows hard and twitches his head back and forth, \"He isn’t the same guy he used to be. They did something to him, they broke him somewhere along the line. He went crazy on Marshall and he\u0027s been weird about you. He built these places with Marshall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t like that either. \"Shit,\" I mutter, \"I don’t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at Leo, \"Will, will be fine if we leave him here. We need to get the heck out of dodge. You and the girls need to leave now. I can come back for Will when we get settled and safe somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right. I hate it but he is. My nerves are back as I stand out of his grip and look at Leo, \"Stay here and guard the path. Don’t let them come down to the water and surprise us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake nods, not realizing I\u0027m talking to the wolf. Leo stands and walks to the path where I\u0027m pointing. Jake follows him, making me smile past the millions of things flying through my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but see the similarities in the romance novels Granny had. The bad hot guy was always really bad, and the girl always missed it, somehow. I hate that I kissed him and that he made my heart pitter-patter. I want to hate him. I realize I\u0027m muttering to myself when I meet Mary on the trail. She snickers, \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"No. You need to tell me how bad we\u0027re talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks back and shakes her head, \"I was leaving in a couple days with Megs and Sarah and my boy. I wasn’t staying here, no way. We\u0027d be safer in a town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, \"Come with us.\" I don’t trust her enough to give details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Talk to Will. He\u0027s working out the details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am testing her and I see the team she\u0027s on when her eyes flash, \"You can\u0027t trust him. He\u0027s still in charge of this camp and those people who hate you. This isn’t that kind of world; you can\u0027t trust people. I know you think he’s going to save you, but you’re one girl, and this is an easy life here. He isn’t going to trade the easy life for traveling and being on the run with you. He\u0027s not that one-woman kind of guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be ready then and I will signal you to make a run for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles, \"Okay. Who is coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, still watching her face, \"I don’t know. Us girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seems satisfied. I\u0027m terrified she isn’t real either. My stomach is screaming to run from her too. I nod toward the pool of water, \"I\u0027ll get them and put them to bed in a tent, we can see about leaving tomorrow in the morning, before daylight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowls, \"That’s early in the summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod once, \"Okay. That’s the plan then.\" I turn and hurry to the water. We\u0027re leaving now. I don’t know what\u0027s up, but the magic in my belly is telling me we gotta leave now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg sees me first, \"Get them out.\" I say. She hears the panic and waves at Anna and Sarah. They swim over. Anna sees my face and grabs Sarah\u0027s hand. She drags her to the edge of the water and pulls her up onto the flat rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are leaving now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey look at me. I don’t need to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna hauls her clothes on as I hold up Sarah\u0027s shirt for her. Meg is dressed and on the path. We run up the hill to see Leo and Jake there. Jake is petting him and acting nonchalant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t hear anything else. No birds, no noises, no people. I sneak up on Jake and whisper, \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumps, looking shocked, \"Dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. He shakes his head, \"No one came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look past him; it\u0027s quiet in the camp. I point to the left, \"We go that way, run for the opposite side of the hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks stunned, \"We\u0027re leaving now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Mary? She said she was coming tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to slap him in the head, \"No. We leave now. We have enough people to be responsible for.\" I look back, \"Anna get Sarah down the left side of the mountain. Meg, go steal some food, knives, and water. We have the rifle and the bow. I\u0027ll get Jake down the side over here, he\u0027s too big to go that way with you. Meet at the bottom of the second big hill.\" I remember getting arrows down that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna grabs Sarah\u0027s hand and they\u0027re gone before I even turn to face Meg. She grins and vanishes amongst the tents and trees. I grab Jake\u0027s hand and pull him. He crunches and plods along. I grip my bow and hold my breath, so I don’t snap at him. Leo scouts ahead. The guys in the trees aren’t back up yet. If we hurry they won\u0027t even notice us leaving. We\u0027re still hungry and cold and wet; even in the hot summer sun, the forest is cool and damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t understand why he came all that way to get me back with you and Anna if he was just going to betray me here,\" I mutter and continue dragging his huge ass down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know if he will betray you, but I don’t trust him,\" he huffs and puffs behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back, \"You seemed pretty sure a few minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs and climbs over a fallen log, \"He\u0027s acting weird, Em. What do you want me to say? He isn’t the same person he used to be. His moods are weird. He was insane when we were looking for you—insane. Then we found you and he seemed like a psycho, all angry and pissed. He beat Marshall to near death. He screamed at Anna when she found us and had you in the woods. He shook her so hard. I don’t trust him. He was desperate to get here, now they don’t want us. He loves this camp. He\u0027s lost his damned mind. We can come back for him. We know where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI break into a sprint when we hit a flat area. Jake is close to me; he\u0027s huffing but keeping up. We make it to the bottom of the huge hill. I point to a bush, \"In there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe run for the bush and jump into it. Leo lays next to me, in the ready crouch. Jake is bent, trying to catch his breath. There is no movement I can see in the woods. The slope makes it impossible to not be seen, there are no trees that are big enough for them to hide behind. I point to the right, \"I\u0027m going to find Anna and Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a twig and look over to see them creeping up to us, \"You don’t have to,\" Anna smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. I know she heard Jake coming down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hide in the bush and wait. My guts hurt. They always hurt. Our little band of us feels huge and weak compared to the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Will?\" Anna whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her and shake my head, \"He\u0027s staying, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake nods, \"He\u0027s losing it, dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens her mouth to get angry, but we hear Meg. We both look up to the hill to see her trudging down with a small sack and a boy. I sigh, \"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s her boyfriend,\" Sarah says in her little voice. I feel my face tighten, \"Shit.\" Sarah smiles, \"His name is Ron. He\u0027s pretty nice. He\u0027s sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes and look at Leo, \"At least he\u0027s not thirty.\" I put a hand out, \"You stay.\" Leo sits but his eyes never leave Ron. I watch the hillside behind them and pull an arrow. \"Anna, if I have to fire, you know to run. This is the same valley you would have come up through to stalk Leo and me before. Go to the house and hide in the trees, I\u0027ll find you. We\u0027re close to the cabin so make sure Jake doesn’t fall in the hole.\" I give her a look. She nods and smiles at Jake. He rolls his eyes and sighs, \"It was one time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneak from the bush with the arrow tight. There is nothing coming down the hill but Meg who grins when she sees me. \"This is Ron, he\u0027s sixteen so if you\u0027re gonna beat his ass, just know he\u0027s some loony religion that doesn’t believe in sex before marriage.\" Coming from the only one of us who believes completely in God, it\u0027s weird she says the religion is loony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoff, \"Get behind the bush and shut up.\" Ron, a boy with shaggy dark-blond hair and a cute face, grins some crooked teeth at me. He gives a slight wave. I scowl and watch the hill. Nothing moves, but that means nothing. We are dealing with Will. He\u0027s sneaky and mean. Holding the arrow tight, I know I can\u0027t shoot him. He makes my heart rate go nuts and my insides hurt, but I can\u0027t shoot him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see something; my animal eyes pick it up. I look back, \"Run! The cabin is up the hill on the far side. Anna you know the way….\" They\u0027re already running before I have a chance to finish the sentence. We are close to the side of the hill where the hole is. I\u0027ve hunted the mountain on the other side of the valley we are in. It\u0027s actually a miracle I never stumbled upon the camp. It\u0027s one mountain away from my cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo creeps up next to me and crouches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus my eyes again. I see the blond head of the little boy and the shiny brown hair of Mary after a second. I groan and look at Leo. He makes a face and I nod, \"I know.\" Will is walking with them. The three of them are all I see. I relax the bow and feel like I\u0027m about to have a hissy fit. I rub my eyes and wait for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"WOLFIE!\" he shrieks across the valley when they\u0027re close enough to see us. Leo lowers to the ground. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-17.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
