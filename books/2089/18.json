It had felt like that when it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught my expression and gritted his teeth. \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s just - \" He moved his hands in a helpless gesture. I understood. My back wasn\u0027t pretty. I tried not to peek at it, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t let anyone see me naked since it happened. I could tell myself sex didn\u0027t interest me once Jimmy had died, and that was partly true. But nothing increases celibacy like a huge scar that runs from just below your left shoulder to your right hip. My days of wearing bikinis were over. Any hope of a backless wedding gown was as dead as my fiance. But I\u0027d live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBummer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did that to you?\" Damien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, keeping my shoulders slanted away from him. His hands clenched; his muscles bunched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an accident,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if I\u0027d admit a werewolf had marked me as his forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien frowned. \"What kind of accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad. I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got off the bed, crossed the floor, found my clothes. I didn\u0027t even realize I\u0027d presented him with my back again until his fingers drifted over my left shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yelped, jumped, spun. How had he followed so quickly and so quietly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t bear for anyone to touch where Hector had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. It\u0027s been years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, the thing had been aching on and off since I\u0027d seen, or imagined, the white wolf. But I wasn\u0027t going to confess that to anyone, ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it doesn\u0027t hurt, then why can\u0027t I touch you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hell do you think? It\u0027s ugly. I\u0027m - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke off. I\u0027d wanted sex; I\u0027d gotten it. Time to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have scars, too,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up. He pointed to his thigh where a thin white line bisected the skin. I snorted. \"That\u0027s a scratch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, his body was damn near perfect. How had he gotten to be... twenty-something with only one small scar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this what you\u0027re trying so hard to forget?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll never forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I? The scar would be with me forever, along with the memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did one of the wolves hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of putting on my shirt, I froze. \"What wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones you\u0027re after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill trickled over my skin. How could he know who I was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remembered what sex had made me forget. The gun behind his toilet tank. The single silver bullet that I\u0027d already used. I might be lying to him, but he was lying to me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished dressing. Time to get back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien lit a cigarette, stood at the window, naked, blowing smoke through his nose. He offered me a drag, but right now I didn\u0027t want to put my mouth where his had been. It might make me want to put my mouth other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, the movement pulling his muscles tight, then releasing them. \"No one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why were you hiding the gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"What gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe complete bafflement on his face slowed me down. \"Uh, the one behind the toilet tank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a brow, then the cigarette to his mouth. Slowly he drew in, blew out. \"When were you in my bathroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops. I decided to be honest. About one thing anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I broke in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emergency bathroom break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know how to explain why I\u0027d gone through his things. I\u0027d had good reason, but none I could tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuger-Suchers were supposed to be a secret monster-hunting society. Secret.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;As in, need-to-know only. He didn\u0027t need to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of that going around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me ask you a question,\" Damien murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said, eager to get off the previous topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his thumb and forefinger together over the glowing stub. I blinked. That had to hurt, but he didn\u0027t flinch. I recalled the sensation of his scarred, rough hands dancing over my body. Maybe it didn\u0027t hurt anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cigarette extinguished, he flicked what was left end over end. It landed between my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Killing and burning wolves. Breaking and entering.\" He crossed the room, stopping so close I could smell the smoke on his breath. I wanted to lick his teeth. \"Searching my room and finding a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t touch me, didn\u0027t have to. Just the scent of him, the heat, all that lovely pale skin and rippling muscle. My body remembered and it yearned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice lowered, so soft I had to strain to hear him. \"Who are you, Leigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanger, danger. Time to lie a little more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. I\u0027m with the DNR. The wolves...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind blanked. What was my cover again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said. \"That new strain of rabies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I let out a silent sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the gun?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - um - confiscated it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confiscated? Can you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" I wasn\u0027t exactly sure, but he didn\u0027t need to know that, either. \"Is it yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I moved in, you can bet I never looked behind the toilet tank. Who knows who lived here before me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he telling the truth? I kind of thought that he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the gun was his, he was a very good actor. If the gun was his, what possible good could a single silver bullet do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question now was: Whose gun had it been?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother job for Jessie McQuade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still standing so close the hair on my arms prickled. He hadn\u0027t touched me since the ill-fated stroke to my back. I wanted him to, and because of that, I headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my hand on the knob, I stopped. He followed, reaching out to place a hand on my shoulder. I tensed, but he refused to let go. When I\u0027d yearned for his touch, I hadn\u0027t meant there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I yearned and hated myself for it, hated him, I lashed out. \"This was a stupid idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis quiet admission was like throwing ice water on my anger. I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. Sex had made me forget for a little while the realities of my life. But once the madness receded, I could see clearly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lying to him. He had no idea who I was. What I did. He had no idea how dangerous it was to know me. If he was around when the shit hit the fan - and it would; it was only a matter of time - he\u0027d get hurt. He might get dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked open the door. On the threshold I paused. All the cars were still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone ever go home around here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of them walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back. Damien stood in the doorway, stark naked and aroused. I wanted him again. So much for self-control. What I felt for Damien reminded me far too much of what I\u0027d once felt for Hector, and it frightened me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced my gaze back to the cars. \"They walk home in the dark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than driving after you\u0027ve been drinking since midafternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of them live in town. It\u0027s quicker getting home as the crow flies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was with all the crow references?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A crow flies straight from one place to another. They don\u0027t care about roads. If you go home as the crow flies...\" His arm shot past my face, finger extended toward the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean your customers walk home through the forest at night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could think of several reasons. All of them furry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have any of them disappeared lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disappeared how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One day here, tomorrow not so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t wonder where they went?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People come and go. They move. They start patronizing a different tavern. I\u0027m not their father. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they got killed by wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. He was skirting a little close to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves aren\u0027t aggressive,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are if they\u0027re rabid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much was true. All reports of wolf attacks were by rabid animals - or at least that\u0027s what we liked the common folk to believe. If the news got out that werewolves lived all over the place, it wouldn\u0027t be pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What aren\u0027t you telling me?\" he asked. \"Have there been rabid wolf attacks in Crow Valley? Is that why you\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was another lie among so many others? I had to make him stop asking questions any way that I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we don\u0027t want that to get out,\" I said hurriedly. \"People will panic. We\u0027ll have nuts in the forest with guns, shooting pets, then each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention the press.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flicked him a glance. I hadn\u0027t thought of that, but he was right. Imagine, if you will, reports of a rabid wolf pack eating people upstate. What a story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can see why I\u0027m being secretive,\" I said. \"We\u0027re handling the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By we, you mean you and the sheriff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were handling the problem. Just not that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t tell anyone?\" I pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who am I going to tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the bar, then back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"I don\u0027t tell them anything. I listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved in my direction, and I fled before he kissed me again. One more like any of the others and I might forget everything I should remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried up the steps and inside my apartment, then glanced at my watch. Seven a.m. I had to be back at Jessie\u0027s by noon so we could go over the Quantico report on serial killers. I could hardly wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a long, hot shower. By the time I got out I smelled like citrus and honey, not earth and wind. My muscles were relaxed, my brain mush. I went to bed, fell asleep right away, and for the first time in my life I had nightmares in the daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my dream the white wolf speaks, with Hector\u0027s voice. \"Querida,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what did you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d always called me querida,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;even though there\u0027d been nothing of love in what we\u0027d done. At least for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI back away, my hands outstretched, but he keeps coming, his stiff-legged gait and raised hackles terrifying, the growl beneath the words making my skin prickle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to get rid of them so you could be mine forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear myself speak in my sleep; the word echoes through my dream. Hector smiles, grins, pants. His teeth are as red as his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, get me away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spin and run up the steps in the home of my childhood. But my childhood is over - beginning right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine,\" Hector snarls at the others, stopping their mad pursuit of fleeing prey in midstep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector is the alpha - there is no doubt, no question. Just as there is no question that he will catch me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth then and now. It is only a matter of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lock myself in my room, grab the phone, listen for a dial tone, and hear nothing. My cell phone is downstairs, in my purse, useless to me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run to the window, but before I can get it open and scream for someone, anyone, to help me, the door splinters inward, and he is there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want him near me with the blood of my loved ones still wet on his fur, ripe in his mouth. I look around for a weapon, something, anything, but there is nothing in this pink and white frothy sanctuary of my childhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never die, querida.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We\u0027ll be together always. You\u0027ll like it. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare into his eyes and remember how it came to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deaths of my family, of Jimmy, were my own fault. Because I couldn\u0027t say no when Hector touched me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my sleep I moan, toss, turn. I couldn\u0027t stop myself from touching Damien, either. But it isn\u0027t the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not promised to another. I\u0027m not having a last fling. I\u0027m not flirting with the Devil. Damien is just a man. Hector was a beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move as far into the room as I can, cower against the wall, wait for him to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are so human they make me dizzy. I stared into those eyes while he did... amazing things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings that made me writhe, moan, scream for more. Hector had bewitched me, and now I knew why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunshots erupt downstairs. The sentries howl. The scent of burning flesh and flame drifts upward and Hector snarls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he\u0027ll run. Instead he lunges. I turn away, hide my head, wait for the slash of his teeth. My dress tears; cool air caresses my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves mate for life, querida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorried, disturbed, I straighten, glance over my shoulder just as he strikes - claw, not tooth. But why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scream as white-hot agony erupts from shoulder to hip. He leaps upward, muscles flexing, body stretching - both horrible and beautiful at the same time. He crashes through the glass and is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward bursts into the room, hurries to the window, curses. As I lose consciousness, he bends over me and whispers, \"Everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone begins to ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped and came awake with the bright light of day shining across my face. How long had I slept? Not long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a strange dream. Hector the wolf had never spo-ken, though the words of my dream were real enough. He\u0027d told me things in phone calls that made me weep. It had been my fault my family had died, because I\u0027d let Hector into my life and he hadn\u0027t wanted to let me out of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was possessive, obsessive. Freaking crazy. He wanted me for himself, and the only way to keep me was to make certain I had no one to turn to but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t counted on Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d traced the calls after I got out - by then, I had the technology - but they\u0027d been placed from pay phones in different parts of the country. It did me no good to report them to the police. Dead men didn\u0027t dial long-distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. My cell phone was ringing now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The sound wasn\u0027t an echo of the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a groan, I hoisted myself out of bed and crossed to the kitchen table. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched, half-expecting Hector\u0027s deep, musical voice to whisper my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell are you?\" Jessie snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief made me smile. \"Good morning to you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the report from Quantico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think your friend Hector is on it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-18.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
