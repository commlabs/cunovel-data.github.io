He shakes himself out of the reverie and glances over at the corpses on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb and Jeanie Duchamp, he says. What do you think of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s to think of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took the quick way out, he says. Must of been right after it all started, they been dead for a while. Cleaned up the house, got gussied up, and swallowed a bunch of Nembutal. Didn’t want to see the future world, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at them, the dead embraced. She realizes something: She hates them for being dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what was your plan next? Moses Todd asks. If things here didn’t work out, where were you headed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know, she says. Hadn’t thought that far. Maybe north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiagara Falls? he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiagara Falls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was there once, he muses. You stand on the top of a cliff by the falls and lean over the rail, it’ll take your breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad, he says, referring to the unfortunate matter of his own quashing of her plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, she says, too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, Moses Todd says, gesturing with a nod toward the corpses on the bed, did you notice their ears?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about em?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake a look. Go on, I ain’t tryin to trick you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gets up and walks to the side of the bed and leans over. Coming from each of their ears is a little runnel of blood, dried black and crusty against the gray cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits back down in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone took care of em, she says. So they wouldn’t come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow isn’t that a thing to ponder? Who do you reckon did it? Jeb could of done Jeanie, of course, but who did him? Whoever it was didn’t want to move the bodies. Romantic sympathies is my guess. What you think? Son or daughter—weeping as they are forced to put the finishin touch on death? Nosy neighbor? State police doin a last evacuation sweep? Who do you reckon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know, she says. There’s lots of people around who’ll do the right thing. It ain’t everybody who’s bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that’s a true thing, he says. He nods and smiles, gratified by the notion. That’s as true a thing as you ever said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, she goes on, the Duchamps ain’t worth anything to me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses Todd looks at her curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot touched by their tragedy? he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ain’t no tragedy. It’s just foolishness—the kind I can’t tolerate. The kind that makes them worse than the meatskins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the meatskins found somethin worth desiring. They keep on and keep on till the very last minute when they fall over in a pile of dust. They haven’t got notions of takin themselves out of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people find the world intolerable, the way it’s become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow’s it become? It ain’t become nothing different since I been in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses Todd smiles at her, a smile that acknowledges her age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m serious now, she goes on. I want to know—how’s it become?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got . . . Moses Todd starts to answer and then considers, thinking about his answer, as if it were of paramount importance to get it just right. Then he continues:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got lonesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at him through squinted, disbelieving eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople weren’t lonesome before? she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were. The world wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here’s another thing, she says. Before, back in the basement, you said I ain’t evil. How come you said that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCause it’s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you know about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell, he says simply. You’re a book I know how to read, little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you never answered me before. If I ain’t evil, then what am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re just angry. Just grievin like everybody else. Only you don’t like to admit it to yourself. It ain’t so complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns this over and over in her head. It never quite comes into clear definition, but it has the sting of truth to it. She puts his response away in a pocket in the back of her mind to think about it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Moses Todd rises from his chair and moves toward her. He sighs and shakes his head slowly like someone who wishes the moment could last but laments the slow sure passage of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reckon we know why we’re here, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reckon we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about you put down that blade of yours?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust because you ask me to? I ain’t gonna make this easy for you, Mose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raises the gun and levels it at her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut it down now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands just out of chopping range of her arm. No matter how quickly she moves, he will have the upper hand. It’s a silly way to die. She drops the gurkha knife to the floor, and Moses Todd takes two steps forward and kicks the blade under the bed. Now the barrel of the gun is twelve inches from her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are you doin this, Mose? You don’t wanna do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant’s got nothin to do with it. You know that, little girl. You killed my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t a good man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses Todd shrugs sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people, he says, they hide themselves away from the eyes of the world. They hunker down and shiver. They find four walls high enough to put between them and everything else. Those people, to them the world is a frightful place. See, you and me, we’re different. When we are called on to move, we move. It don’t matter the cause or the distance. Revenge or ministration, reason or folly—it’s all the same to us. We may not like it, but we go. Because you and me, little girl, we’re children of God, we’re soldiers, we’re travelers. And to us the world is a marvelment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe things he says strike her as true, despite herself. And his eyes are filled with a kind of pleading, as though he needs her to understand him—as though the gun at her head were instead a hand held out in brotherhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich it is, she knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fellowship of life that talks in a language of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis will to destroy her, and her will to remain undestroyed—both things are beautiful and holy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what now? she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you die, he says simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou best turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah. You gonna have to do it lookin in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won’t stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’ll be easier for you if you don’t see it comin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy ain’t my way of doin things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m gonna do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo it then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks in his eyes, she sees herself reflected there, a creature of violence, a brutal thing, a sad thing. Then she looks at his hand, steady, the finger on the trigger of the gun. She focuses on that finger, watching for the slightest twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has one chance. The edge of a moment, a fingernail clipping of time—the speck between his brain telling him to pull the trigger and his finger actually doing it. That’s her window. Too soon and the gun follows her with a clear sharpness of mind. Too late is too late. But there is that fragment of a second, she knows—that shadow between thought and action. It’s where regret lives, the mind already apologizing for the actions of the body. She knows it. God knows she knows it. She knows what it feels like on the skin, in the fingers. She can see it as good as with X-ray sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses Todd, his eyes, his lips behind that dark beard, the barrel of the gun, the finger on the trigger, the twitch, the moment—there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lunges down and forward, the gun exploding over her where her head was a millisecond before. She drives her head into his belly hard, buckling the big man in two, and she grabs the pistol by its barrel and twists so it comes lose from his grip. But before she can turn it on him, he uses the back of his hand to smack it across the room, where it thuds against the floral-papered wall and drops behind the nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it, little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses Todd catches his breath and pushes her back against the chair and gets his hands around her neck, his thick thumbs digging into her windpipe. She grabs his wrists and tries to squirm out from under his grip, but his arms are heavy and dense as the freshly cut limbs of trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou gotta die by my hand, little girl, he is saying, his voice full of something other than anger. That’s all, you just have to. Otherwise none of it makes any goddamn sense. You know it. You and me, we got vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are filled with stars on the insides of her lids, and her head feels like it will float away, and her throat can’t swallow, and all she hears through the sound of her own heart pounding is his voice saying words like the advice of a sage man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got vision, he says again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicks out with her foot and gets him hard between the legs, and the hands are gone from her throat, and she’s choking and coughing, and her lungs are filling with air, and her head is still pounding—but she no longer feels weightless, she has gravity and force, and she gets up and runs past him out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her there’s a throaty bellow of pain that deepens halfway through into a snarling fury. Moses Todd crashes against the doorjamb and throws his limping body forward just as she comes to the head of the stairs at the end of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLead him away from Maury, is what she’s thinking. Lead him away from Maury. Outside. Whatever’s gonna happen can happen outside the house. Maury don’t need to see it nor hear it. Maury’s seen enough in his time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounds down the steps and swings the front door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen everything slows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks behind her quickly. She can see Maury’s face, in the dark, peeking at her from around the corner of the dining room where he still sits, quietly holding the crystal ball with the flower in the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaury. His name repeated in her mind. Maury. Maury. Maury. As if to affix it there for good. As if to emboss it on the old leather of her weary brain. And then it mixes with another name. Malcolm. Again Malcolm. Always Malcolm. So many things stored up for later. So many things to look at and think about when it’s quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turns away and runs out the front door, one, two, three, four full steps before she sees the girl standing in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t register until it’s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Millie. Mutant girl. Inheritor of the earth. Millie with teeth like shovels, a grotesque overgrown child, like a doll grown taller than Temple herself, her skin ripped at the joints and peeled back entirely from one hand—as though her insides were growing faster than her outside. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-reapers-are-the-angels-reapers-1/page-35.html","bookId":2516,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:20:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:20:50 PM"}
