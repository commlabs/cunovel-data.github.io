The familiar urge to kill fills me as soon as I see his face, but I force myself not to attack. I swallow it down like unspewed vomit, the nauseous unease sitting heavy in my gut. I get up and stand opposite him, and although he tries to hide it, I can see the nervousness in his eyes. The longer we remain facing each other, the more confident he slowly begins to become. But I can still feel his fear. I can almost taste it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, my man,\" he says as I take the tray from him and sit back down on the bed and start to eat, \"have done incredibly well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I mumble, my mouth full. Truth is, I don\u0027t give a shit what he thinks. I\u0027m just relieved, excited almost, that I managed not to attack. It\u0027s hard, almost too hard, but I force myself to keep control. I try to concentrate on the food to distract myself, but the urge to kill him refuses to fade. I struggle to keep it in check, almost dropping the tray and lunging at him when he moves. I manage to regain my focus at the last second. This is almost impossible. It\u0027s a constant fight, almost like I\u0027m having to remember to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really pleased,\" Mallon continues, even the sound of his voice making my guts twist with agitation. \"You\u0027ve really understood what we\u0027re trying to do here. You know, most people take a few more days to get to this stage, but you, you\u0027ve got brains. You\u0027ve worked it out in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a lot to work out really, is there?\" I say, trying to keep up the illusion. \"It\u0027s like you said, the more you fight, the less you get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watches me a while longer as I polish off the rest of the tasteless food. I glance up and see he\u0027s looking at me like a proud parent, and it dawns on me that he really does believe all the bullshit he\u0027s been spinning. I feel vastly superior to this idiot. He thinks he\u0027s the one in the driver\u0027s seat, but I\u0027m in control. The mental advantage I have now makes it easier to cope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what next?\" I ask, feeling calmer and more assured. I decide to hedge my bets and see how far I can push him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your plan? Do you just want to keep me locked up here forever? Is this some kind of rehabilitation program you\u0027ve started? Or are you going to start experimenting on me and cutting me up into little pieces?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmug bastard starts laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re good! No, to tell you the truth, Danny, what happens next isn\u0027t up to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who decides?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, for one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Sahota.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sahota? Who the hell\u0027s Sahota?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll find out tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts moving toward the door. Suddenly this is a conversation he doesn\u0027t want to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t just walk out now. Who is Sahota?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up again and move toward him, but all that does is make him move faster. He stops midway out of the door-just beyond the reach of my chains-and turns back to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss man,\" he says simply. Now he\u0027s definitely playing games again, feeding me just enough detail to keep my interest, then clamming up and leaving me dangling. It\u0027s all he\u0027s got left. Other than these physical chains, information is the only advantage remaining. If he was any closer I\u0027d rip his fucking throat out. He pulls the door shut, but then stops and opens it again. \"Wait. There\u0027s something I forgot to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your daughter...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You found her?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t hide my sudden interest and emotion. Please tell me something...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he says, shaking his head. \"You\u0027ve got to understand, Danny, information\u0027s hard to come by these days. You learn more from what you\u0027re not told than from what you\u0027re told. The Central System is creaking under the weight of what\u0027s happened and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs and takes a deep breath, drawing it out as long as he can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s good and bad news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bad news is there are no records of her anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how can there be any good news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you see, that is the good news. It means she might not be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might not be dead... that\u0027s all you can tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be thankful for small mercies, Danny. As far as I know, my daughter\u0027s still lying on the kitchen floor with a bloody hole where her face used to be. I could have been standing here telling you the date your girl died and where they burned her body. As it is, you\u0027ve still got some hope. What you do with it is up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slams the door shut and locks it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIX A.M. SANDWICHED BETWEEN two heavily armed military jeeps and chaperoned by columns of soldiers and militia fighters, several hundred displaced refugees were led out along Arley Road. With no regard for personal preferences, friendships, partners, or relatives, specified numbers of individuals were filtered off toward each building. No one resisted or complained. They were too tired and too scared to show any defiance or opposition to what they were being told to do. Their choices were stark: put up with it or fuck off and take your chances on your own. And anyone who dared show any resistance to the military would be on the street with a bullet in the head. Public order had to be maintained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s no more room in here,\" Mark protested, blocking the door of room 33. \"I told them last night-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUninterested, the soldier shoved him out of the way and forced his way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the problem?\" Kate asked, getting up from the end of the bed and standing in his way, instinctively wrapping her arms around her pregnant belly, cradling and protecting her unborn child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no problem,\" he answered quickly, his tired, gruff voice muffled by his face mask. \"New roommate for you, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s crazy! We don\u0027t have enough space as it is. How are we supposed to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her back down onto the bed, then turned and walked back toward the door again, pausing only to sidestep Mark. Mark knew there was no point trying to argue; at best he\u0027d just be ignored, at worst he could be accused of being a Hater and \"removed.\" Kate chased after the officer, far less concerned about the potential repercussions of her outburst. Behind her, her parents sat up to try to see what was happening. Her father, weakened by age, fear, and malnutrition, simply lay back again when he couldn\u0027t see anything, too tired to care. Her mother, once an intelligent, demure, and gentle woman, balanced on the end of the bed half naked, screaming like a banshee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s enough of them in here already. We don\u0027t want more. You take them and find somewhere else for them to go. You can\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate ran back to silence her, leaving Mark at the door to placate the soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gurmit Singh,\" the trooper announced as he shoved an elderly Asian man into the room. Singh protested with a high-volume, high-speed torrent of Punjabi, which was neither understood nor acknowledged by anyone. A battered leather carryall was thrown into the room after him, containing the sum total of his worldly possessions. He tripped over the bag, almost losing his light-orange-colored turban in the process, then turned around and continued his vociferous tirade. When the soldier pulled the door shut in his face, he simply turned again without pausing for breath and continued unloading at Mark, who shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t understand,\" he said, desperate to shut the man up. \"Speak English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No English,\" he snapped back, then continued his rant in Punjabi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t stay here,\" Kate\u0027s mother screamed from the bed. \"We can\u0027t have his type here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingh pointed at her, or was it at the bed? He rubbed the small of his back, then thumped his hand on the mattress and raised his voice to an ever louder, even more uncomfortable volume. Mark tried reasoning with him, desperate for him to be quiet. Singh ignored him, then picked up his bag and angrily sat down in the armchair in the corner of the room, still yelling furiously and pointing at the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate stood by the hotel room door, her hands over her ears, desperately trying to block out the endless, directionless noises coming from both her mother and Gurmit Singh. Mark tried to hold her, but she pulled away from him, almost recoiling from his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stand this,\" she sobbed. \"Either they go or I go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of us can go anywhere. For Christ\u0027s sake, Katie, that\u0027s the problem, there\u0027s nowhere else to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care. Kick them out. Throw them out on the street if you have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you talking about now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know exactly who I mean. It\u0027s too dangerous. We\u0027ve got to think about ourselves and the baby and just screw the rest of them-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. You know I can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will. I mean it, Mark, if you don\u0027t get rid of them, I\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie, there\u0027s nowhere for them to go. Please, sweetheart, just calm down and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t patronize me. Don\u0027t tell me to calm down. How can I calm down when-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" he begged, putting his hand up to her mouth. \"Please don\u0027t shout, Katie, they\u0027ll hear us. Don\u0027t do anything that\u0027ll give them any reason to come back in here. You know what\u0027ll happen if they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should,\" she said, pushing him away. \"Maybe that\u0027s exactly what I should do. Maybe if they knew what was going on here they\u0027d help. They\u0027d come up here and get rid of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" he hissed angrily, covering her mouth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGurmit Singh, who had just started to quiet down, suddenly exploded into life again, startled by the appearance of Lizzie, who emerged from the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Singh,\" Mark answered. \"He\u0027s just been delivered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we don\u0027t have any space-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t have his kind here,\" Kate\u0027s mother yelled, reaching out and grabbing hold of Lizzie\u0027s arm and pulling her closer. Lizzie shrugged her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many here,\" Singh yelled back, suddenly switching to English. \"Back bad. Need bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you can do the language when it suits you, then,\" Kate sneered at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on, Mark?\" Lizzie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing we can do about it,\" he began. \"We don\u0027t have any say-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go on like this,\" Kate interrupted, desperate tears welling up in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to-\" Mark started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what I\u0027m supposed to do, then, Kate,\" Lizzie snapped angrily. \"I heard what you were saying. I know what you want-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then do something about it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else am I supposed to go? What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother outburst from Singh interrupted the argument. He got up from his seat and pushed between them, still gesturing toward the bed. Furious, Lizzie shoved him back down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back off!\" she spat before turning to face Kate again. \"Put yourself in my shoes, Katie. What would you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t stay here. It\u0027s not safe. You\u0027re putting all of us at risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look around, we\u0027re already at risk. Everyone who\u0027s left alive is at risk, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, both of you,\" Mark whispered, trying unsuccessfully to separate the two women, worried that their noise would bring the soldiers back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to calm down,\" Kate yelled, throwing open the bathroom door and pointing inside. \"That thing in there is evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That thing in there is my daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed your sons!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but she\u0027s still my daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizzie knelt down in the doorway. Curled up on the floor in front of her, chained to the sink pedestal, gagged and bound and heavily sedated, lay Ellis. Lizzie stroked her hair and ran her hand gently down the side of her tranquilized face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She could kill you, Lizzie. She could kill all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I can\u0027t let her go. Try to understand...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes there is. What if your baby turns out to be like this?

I\u0027ll protect her and fight for her until the bitter end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we go on like this,\" Kate warned, \"that will be sooner than you think.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-26.html","bookId":2556,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM"}
