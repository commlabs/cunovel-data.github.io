{"id":19359,"no":2,"title":"THE VICOMTESSE DE CAMBES.II","content":"On the day following Madame la Princesse\u0027s entry into Bordeaux, there was a grand dinner-party at ?le Saint-Georges, Canolles having invited the principal officers of the garrison and the other governors of fortresses throughout the province.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At two o\u0027clock in the afternoon, the hour appointed for the beginning of the repast, Canolles found himself surrounded by a dozen or more gentlemen, the majority of whom he then saw for the first time. As they described the great event of the preceding day, making sport of the ladies in Madame la Princesse\u0027s retinue, they bore but little resemblance to men about to enter upon what might be an obstinate conflict, and to whom the most momentous interests of the kingdom were intrusted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles, magnificent in his gold-laced coat, and with radiant face, set the example of gayety and animation. As dinner was about to be served, he said:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Messieurs, I beg your pardon, but there is still one guest missing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who is it?\" the young men asked, exchanging glances.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The governor of Vayres, to whom I sent an invitation, although I do not know him, and who, just because I do not know him, is entitled to some indulgence. I beg, therefore, that you will pardon a delay of half an hour.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The governor of Vayres!\" exclaimed an old officer, accustomed to military regularity, and from whom the suggestion of delay brought forth a sigh,—\"the governor of Vayres, if I mistake not, is the Marquis de Bernay; but he doesn\u0027t administer the government in person; he has a lieutenant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In that case,\" said Canolles, \"if he doesn\u0027t come, his lieutenant will come in his place. He is himself undoubtedly at court, the fountain-head of favors.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But, baron,\" said one of the guests, \"it doesn\u0027t seem to me that he need be at court to secure promotion, for I know a certain commandant who has no reason to complain. Dame! captain, lieutenant-colonel, and governor, all within three months! That\u0027s a very pretty little road to travel, you must confess.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I do confess it,\" said Canolles, blushing, \"and as I know not to whom to attribute such a succession of favors, I must, in good sooth, agree that there is some good genius in my household to bring me such prosperity.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We have no question as to Monsieur le Gouverneur\u0027s good genius,\" said the lieutenant who received Canolles upon his arrival; \"it is his merit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do not deny the merit, far from it,\" said another officer; \"I am the first to bear witness to it. But I will take the liberty of adding to it the patronage of a certain lady, the cleverest, most generous, most lovable of her sex,—after the queen, of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No insinuations, count,\" rejoined Canolles, smiling at the last speaker; \"if you have any secrets of your own, keep them for your own sake; if they concern your friends, keep them for your friends\u0027 sake.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I confess,\" said an officer, \"that when I heard a suggestion of delay, I supposed that our forgiveness was to be sought in favor of some gorgeous toilet. But I see that I was mistaken.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pray, do we dine without ladies?\" asked another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dame! unless I invite Madame la Princesse and her suite,\" said Canolles, \"I hardly see whom we could have; besides, we must not forget, messieurs, that our dinner-party is a serious function; if we choose to talk business we shall bore nobody but ourselves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well said, commandant, although the women do seem to be engaged in a veritable crusade against our authority at this moment; witness what Monsieur le Cardinal said in my presence to Don Luis de Haro.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did he say?\" Canolles asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027You are very fortunate! Spanish women think of nothing but money, flirting, and lovers, while the women of France refuse to take a lover now until they have sounded him on political questions; so that,\u0027 he added, despairingly, \u0027lovers pass their time discussing affairs of State.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For that reason,\" said Canolles, \"the present war is called the \u0027war of women;\u0027 a very flattering title for us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that moment, just as the half-hour\u0027s reprieve expired, the door opened, and a servant announced that Monsieur le Gouverneur was served.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles requested his guests to follow him; but as the procession was about to start, another announcement was heard in the reception-room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Monsieur le Gouverneur de Vayres!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah!\" said Canolles; \"it\u0027s very kind of him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stepped forward to meet the colleague in whom he expected to find a stranger, but started back in amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Richon!\" he cried; \"Richon, governor of Vayres!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Myself, my dear baron,\" returned Richon, affably, but with his customary serious expression.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah! so much the better! so much the better!\" said Canolles, cordially pressing his hand. \"Messieurs,\" he added, \"you do not know him, but I do; and I say, emphatically, that it would be impossible to intrust an important appointment to a more honorable man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richon looked proudly about upon the guests, and as he detected no other expression in the looks which were bent upon him than polite surprise tempered with much good-will, he said:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear baron, now that you have answered for me so handsomely, present me, I beg you, to those of your guests whom I haven\u0027t the honor of knowing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he spoke he glanced significantly at three or four gentlemen to whom he was an entire stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thereupon ensued an interchange of civilities in the courtly manner characteristic of the time. Before half an hour had passed Richon was on the friendliest terms with all the young officers, and might have asked any one of them for his sword or his purse. His sponsors were his well-known gallantry, his spotless reputation, and the noble spirit written in his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pardieu! messieurs,\" said the governor of Braunes, \"there\u0027s no denying that, although he\u0027s a churchman, Monsieur de Mazarin has a keen eye for fighting-men, and has been managing matters well in that direction for some time. He scents war, and selects for governors, Canolles here, and Richon at Vayres.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is there to be fighting?\" inquired Richon, carelessly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is there to be fighting!\" rejoined a young man fresh from the court. \"You ask if there is to be fighting, Monsieur Richon?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well! I ask you what condition your bastions are in?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They are almost new, monsieur; for in the three days I have been at the fort I have done more repairing and renovating than had been done in three years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good! it won\u0027t be long before they will be tested,\" rejoined the young man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So much the better,\" said Richon. \"What do fighting-men long for? War.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The king can sleep soundly now,\" said Canolles, \"for he holds the Bordelais in check by means of the two rivers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The person who put me where I am can count upon my devotion,\" said Richon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How long do you say you have been at Vayres, monsieur?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Three days. How long have you been at Saint-Georges, Canolles?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A week. Did you have a reception like mine, Richon? Mine was magnificent, and even yet I haven\u0027t thanked these gentlemen sufficiently. There were bells ringing and drums beating, and acclamations. Cannon were the only thing missing, but I have been promised some within a few days, and that consoles me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My reception, my dear Canolles, was as modest as yours was splendid. I was ordered to introduce a hundred men into the place, a hundred men of the Turenne regiment, and I was in a quandary how I was to do it, when my commission, signed by Monsieur d\u0027épernon, arrived at Saint-Pierre, where I then was. I set out at once, handed my commission to the lieutenant, and took possession of the place without drum or trumpet. At present I am there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles, who smiled at the beginning, was conscious of an indefinable presentiment of evil from the tone in which these last words were uttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you are settled there?\" he asked Richon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am putting things in order,\" Richon replied tranquilly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How many men have you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the first place, the hundred men of the Turenne regiment, old soldiers of Rocroy, who can be depended upon; also a company I am forming in the town; as fast as recruits come in, I take them in hand, tradesmen, workingmen, youths, about two hundred in all; lastly, I am expecting a re-enforcement of a hundred or a hundred and fifty men, levied by an officer of the province.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Captain Ramblay?\" inquired one of the guests.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Captain Cauvignac.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know him,\" said several voices.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do,\" said Canolles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is he a stanch royalist?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should not dare to say. I have every reason to think, however, that Captain Cauvignac is a creature of Monsieur le Duc d\u0027épernon and very devoted to him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That answers the question; any man who is devoted to the duke is devoted to his Majesty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s a sort of scout sent on ahead to beat up the country for the king,\" said the old officer, who was making up for the time lost in waiting. \"I have heard of him in that connection.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is his Majesty on his way hither?\" asked Richon, with his customary tranquil manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He should be at least as far as Blois,\" replied the young man just from the court.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you sure of it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quite sure. His army will be commanded by Maréchal de la Meilleraie, who is to effect a junction in this neighborhood with Monsieur le Duc d\u0027épernon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At Saint-Georges, perhaps?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rather at Vayres,\" said Richon. \"Monsieur de la Meilleraie comes from Bretagne, and Vayres is on his road.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The man who happens to be where the two armies come together will have to look well to his bastions,\" said the governor of Braunes. \"Monsieur de la Meilleraie has thirty guns, and Monsieur d\u0027épernon twenty-five.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They will make a fine show,\" said Canolles; \"unfortunately, we shall not see it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"True,\" said Richon, \"unless some one of us declares for the princes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But Canolles is sure to come in for a volley from somebody. If he declares for the princes he\u0027ll have Monsieur de la Meilleraie and Monsieur d\u0027épernon about his ears; if he remains true to his Majesty he\u0027ll taste the fire of the Bordelais.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! as to the latter,\" said Canolles, \"I don\u0027t consider them very terrible, and I confess that I am a little ashamed to have no worthier antagonist. Unfortunately, I am for his Majesty body and soul, and I must be content with a tradesmen\u0027s war.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027ll give you that, never fear,\" said Richon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you any basis for conjecture on that subject?\" queried Canolles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have something better than that,\" said Richon. \"I have certain knowledge. The council of citizens has decided to take ?le Saint-Georges first of all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Canolles, \"let them come; I am ready for them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The conversation had reached this stage and the dessert had just been served, when they heard drums beating at the entrance of the fortress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What does that mean?\" said Canolles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pardieu!\" exclaimed the young officer who had brought the news from court, \"it would be curious if they should attack you at this moment; an assault and escalade would be a delightful after-dinner diversion!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Deuce take me! it looks very much like it,\" said the old officer; \"these wretched cads never fail to disturb you at your meals. I was at the outposts at Charenton at the time of the war in Paris, and we could never breakfast or dine in peace.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles rang; the orderly on duty in the antechamber entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is going on?\" Canolles asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know yet, Monsieur le Gouverneur; some messenger from the king or from the city, no doubt.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Inquire, and let me know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The soldier hastened from the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let us return to the table, messieurs,\" said Canolles to his guests, most of whom had left their seats. \"It will be time enough to leave the table when we hear the cannon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the guests resumed their seats with smiling faces. Richon alone, over whose features a cloud had passed, still seemed restless, and kept his eyes fixed upon the door, awaiting the soldier\u0027s return. But an officer with drawn sword appeared in his stead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Monsieur le Gouverneur,\" said he, \"a flag of truce.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A flag of truce from whom?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From the princes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Coming from where?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From Bordeaux.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From Bordeaux!\" all the guests save Richon repeated in chorus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oho! so war is really declared, is it,\" said the old officer, \"that they send flags of truce?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles reflected a moment, and during that moment his features assumed as grave an expression as the circumstances demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Messieurs,\" said he, \"duty before everything. I shall probably find myself confronted with a question not easy to solve in connection with this message from my Bordeaux friends, and I cannot say when I shall be able to join you again—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No! no!\" cried the guests as one man. \"Allow us to take our leave, commandant; this incident is notice to us to return to our respective posts, and we must separate at once.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was not for me to suggest it, messieurs,\" said Canolles, \"but as the suggestion comes from you I am bound to say that it would be the more prudent course. Bring out the horses or carriages of these gentlemen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As hurried in their movements as if they were already on the battlefield, the guests having been ferried ashore, vaulted into the saddle, or entered their carriages and rode rapidly away, followed by their escorts, in the direction of their respective residences.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richon was the last to take his leave.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Baron,\" said he, \"I did not want to leave you as the others did, as we have known each other longer than you have known any of them. Adieu; give me your hand, and good luck to you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles gave him his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Richon,\" said he, looking earnestly into his face, \"I know you; you have something on your mind; you do not tell it to me, for it probably is not your secret. However, you are moved,—and when a man of your temperament is moved, it\u0027s for no small matter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are we not about to part?\" said Richon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, and so were we about to part when we took leave of each other at Biscarros\u0027s inn, but you were calm then.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Richon smiled sadly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Baron,\" said he, \"I have a presentiment that we shall never meet again!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles shuddered at the profoundly melancholy inflection in the partisan\u0027s ordinarily firm voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, well!\" said he, \"if we do not meet again, Richon, it will be because one of us has died the death of a brave man; and in that case the one who dies will be sure, at all events, of surviving in the heart of a friend! Embrace me, Richon; you wished me good luck; I wish you good courage!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two men embraced warmly, and for some seconds their noble hearts beat against each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they parted, Richon wiped away a tear, the first, perhaps, that ever dimmed his proud glance; then, as if he feared that Canolles might see the tear, he hurried from the room, ashamed, no doubt, to have exhibited such a sign of weakness to a man whose courage was so well known to him.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48663.html","bookId":1205,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:56:02 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:56:02 AM"}
