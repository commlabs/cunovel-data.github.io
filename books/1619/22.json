When fire-flashes lit up the burned-out Snipe, the sorry extent of their progress was revealed. It seemed hours had gone by, yet they had covered only a painful hundred yards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had assumed he would have to carry Ball on his back, but, despite fearful wounds, the pilot was the more fit to make headway. Ball surmounted obstacles that forced him to detours. The vampire was a miracle of the will to endure. It was as if the flaming crash had burned away all but the essential parts. He crawled crab-fashion, using his hands as adeptly as his feet, squirming over the terrain as if born to it. Through cracks in his black carapace of burned flesh and cloth, muscles and tendons glistened, working like oiled pistons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop resolved to be like Albert Ball, to jettison excess mental cargo and concentrate solely on the needs of the moment. He was thinking too much of Catriona, of Beauregard, of Richthofen. He must think only of Edwin Winthrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers of light waved in the sky behind them. If it was dawn, they were heading the wrong way, towards the German lines. It must be fire. After a pause, there were explosions, safely remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop found a French helmet for which the owner could have no further use. He detached it, without distaste, from an unrecognisable protruberance. Besides protection, the ridged Adrian helmet gave him an Allied silhouette. Now, he was less in danger from his own side. Of course, any good German they ran into would shoot him on sight. He doubted the Boche regularly sent night patrols this far into No Man\u0027s Land, but if the big push everyone expected was in the offing there might be sneak parties out making maps and clearing paths. And there were probably Germans wandering around as lost as he was, in traditional blind, trigger-happy panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And we are here as on a darkling plain swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\u0027 he remembered from \u0027Dover Beach\u0027, \u0027where ignorant armies clash by night.\u0027 Matthew Arnold was one of the prophets of the age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Winthrop outfitted himself through grave-robbery, Ball scrambled over the ridge of a shell-crater. Winthrop clambered over a shattered gun-carriage and, leaning heavily on his prop, looked down into the dark where Ball was crawling. In most circumstances, he would have found a vampire like Albert Ball disquieting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis back, turned to Hunland, prickled. He anticipated bullets that would rip through him, ending this nightmare excursion. Suddenly alert, he jumped off the lip of the ridge and slid down in Ball\u0027s wake. His panic passed. He had no idea what had spooked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jump jarred his bad knee and he almost lost hold of the propeller blade. He swore loudly and extensively. Not recommended conduct in a young officer eager to be advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crater was deeper than any they had yet passed. Under its rim darkness was complete, but the muddy bottom was gently moonlit. Another star-shell flared. At least from inside the hole they could not see the damned skeleton Snipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall made it to the bottom of the hole and waited for Winthrop. The pilot stood, limbs unkinking like the fake cripple faith-healed in The Miracle Man. His outstretched arms bent the wrong way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the firing lines of both trenches, the crater was an oasis of safety in a desert of peril. By the time Winthrop got to him, Ball had cracked open a pocket in his Sidcot, or possibly his skin, and slipped out a copper cigarette case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Care for a gasper?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall stuck a cigarette into his mouth, nipping the end between between exposed teeth, and patted his pockets for a box of matches. Winthrop took a cigarette and found his own matches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ta, old son,\u0027 Ball said as Winthrop struck a light. \u0027Mine went off in the bad business back there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout lips, Ball slurred his consonants badly. It was hard for him to suck flame to the tobacco, but a few strong draughts did the trick. His fused nostrils popped open as he exhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop relished the tang of smoke. It was a living taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crater was full of forgotten war dead, jumbled together, pounded into mud. Corpses of all nations were under them everywhere they trod. It was a mass grave waiting for earth to be shovelled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This must be the proverbial pretty pass things come to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall looked around the hole. His eyelids were burned away. Winthrop saw the red tangle of muscle around his eyeballs. The crater was about thirty yards across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Been in worse. Last time, I was shot down in Hunland and had to slog through their trenches. That show was considerably bloodier than this jaunt.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But last time you were shot down by somebody in an aeroplane.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027True enough, but wings are wings.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop shook his head. It would not do to dwell on what had happened in the air. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Time to push on,\u0027 Ball said, stubbing out his cigarette on the steep incline of the crater\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked across the bottom of the hole. When he stood straight, Winthrop\u0027s back ached. He\u0027d been crouching and cringing for hours, trying to present a smaller target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall stopped and held his head like a dog cocking an ear, sensing danger. Before Winthrop could ask what was the matter, darkness swarmed up around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were surrounded by a forest of living scarecrows. Suddenly electrified corpses rose from shallow graves or random piles. Guns were produced and pointed, and cold hands laid on them. Winthrop felt a clutch of pain at his throat and the prod of a bayonet-tip at his ribs. Again, he knew he was seconds from death. Foul breath wafted at his face. If the grip on his throat had relaxed, he would have choked on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not immediately identify the uniform of the soldier who held him. Tatters were applied to the body with mud, as if the man were an African savage. A cloak of camouflage netting was threaded with twigs and leaves. A necklace of cartridge cases and fingerbones hung on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA match struck and a thick-bearded face loomed close to his own. Red eyes shone from a mask of filth. Jagged vampire teeth gnashed, wet with bloody spittle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who goes there? Friend or foe?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was British, but not officer-class. Winthrop would have put the soldier down as a Northcountryman. His terror eased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lieutenant Winthrop,\u0027 he said, through a constricted throat, \u0027Intelligence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature laughed and Winthrop\u0027s terror returned. The throat-grip did not slacken. There were still malice and hunger in the red eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know you,\u0027 the British corpse said. \u0027You\u0027re a poacher.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop was slowly strangling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hunting rights in this estate are exclusive,\u0027 the soldier said, indicating the death-strewn wilderness. \u0027I represent those who hold them.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of the risen dead came to examine the catch. This one was well off his territory: the remnants of an Austrian uniform suggested he had deserted from the Eastern Front to get here. A gasmask, lenses gone from the eyeholes, made his head bulbous. Runic symbols were etched into the leather and a curly moustache was painted on the snoutlike filter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ho, Svejk,\u0027 said Winthrop\u0027s captor, \u0027we\u0027ve netted a representative of Intelligence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvejk laughed too, a muffled malignance. Under the mask, his eyes were maddened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good work, Mellors. Intelligence is a thing we\u0027ve too little of.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvejk spoke thickly accented English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the pack, Winthrop saw French, British, German,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerican and Austrian gear. Some combined equipment from different combatant countries. A golden-haired youth, face painted or dyed scarlet, wore a French tunic and a German helmet, and carried an American carbine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop and Ball were manhandled to the other side of the shell-hole. Winthrop\u0027s propeller was torn away. He bit down on a scream as his knee exploded again. It would not do to show too much funk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the side of the crater was an opening disguised by netting and debris. A dirty curtain whisked aside. They were hustled into a tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027These used to be Froggie trenches,\u0027 Mellors, Winthrop\u0027s captor, explained. \u0027Then they were Fritzie trenches. Now, they\u0027re our bailiwick.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who are you?\u0027 Winthrop asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nous sommes les troglodytes,\u0027 said a Frenchman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Correct, Jim,\u0027 barked an Austrian. \u0027We are the cave-dwellers, the primitives ...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s Jules for you,\u0027 said the Frenchman. \u0027Always explaining. I make the poetry, he adds footnotes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve gone to earth,\u0027 Mellors said. \u0027Down here, there is no war.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few yards of downwards slope, the earth floor was boarded over and the roof was shored up by stout wooden pit- props.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027German workmanship,\u0027 Mellors said. \u0027More concern for the comfort of the fighting man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more laughter at this remark. Especially from Germans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were renegades, deserters from all sides. All seemed nosferatu. Winthrop had heard tales of such degraded creatures, maddened by continual combat, hiding in the thick of war, scavenging for survival. Up to now, he had classed the stories among the legends that had sprung up throughout the war, successors to the ghost bowmen of Mons, the crucified Canadians and the Russians with snow on their boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We get few warm visitors,\u0027 said Mellors, with a tone of resentful mockery. \u0027This is indeed a privilege.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop thought he heard Derbyshire in Mellor\u0027s voice. The soldier obviously had some education but spoke as if trying to forget what he\u0027d learned. There was an ill-sewn set of lieutenant\u0027s pips on his shoulder. He might have won a field promotion from the ranks. It would not do to underestimate this unhappy rogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeld between Jules and Jim, Ball offered no resistance. He was gathering resources, trying to see a way through. Winthrop knew he could count on the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passageway widened and they emerged into an underground dugout decorated like a neolithic cavern. Fires burned in oildrums, coating the ceiling with thick soot. Crude but striking images of violence and rapine were daubed on the walls with boot-black, dirt and blood. The collage incorporated newspaper portraits of Kaiser and King, images of generals and politicians, advertisements from the popular press of Paris and Berlin, and personal photographs of long-lost men. Sweethearts and wives and families were worked into a red and black inferno. All were swallowed by a many-eyed, many-mouthed monster that allegorised the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an overwhelming stench of decay, blood and faecal matter. Homemade coffins were laid out, each billet personalised with items that suggested its occupant\u0027s former life. Foraged weapons and clothes were piled in unsorted lots. There were also scatterings of human bones, some old, some disturbingly fresh. The troglodytes lived in this appalling bolt- hole, emerging by night to feed on the dead and dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Welcome to our happy retreat,\u0027 Mellors said, gesturing freely. \u0027As you see, we have made for ourselves a Utopia away from the idiocies above. We have settled our differences.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There are no German and French, British and Austrian here,\u0027 said Svejk. \u0027All allies, all comrades.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellors let go of Winthrop\u0027s neck. As he bent over to choke and gulp in air, he was skilfully spun round. His wrists were bound with loops of barbed wire. Points stuck into his skin, discouraging struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And there\u0027s no rank,\u0027 Mellors said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re still wearing your pips,\u0027 Winthrop pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellors smiled nastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t make me an officer by your lights, sir. Not a scholarship boy.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might have known,\u0027 the ghastly remnant of Ball said through shiny teeth. \u0027A grammar school oik.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellors laughed deeply and bitterly. For a moment, Winthrop was almost embarrassed by Ball\u0027s sneering. He had been at Greyfriars himself but did not think that alone earned him a place in Heaven. Good schools produced as many swindlers and stranglers as missionaries and martyrs. After all, Harry Flashman was a Rugby man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a conclusion to the night\u0027s business, it seemed odd to listen to a debate between a pair of grotesque vampires on the merits of their old schools. The Nottingham-born Ball was not even that far removed from Mellors in background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The enemy of the soldier is not the soldier on the other side of the ditch,\u0027 Mellors said, \u0027but the high muckety-muck who sends him out to do and die. King or Kaiser, Ruthven or Dracula. They\u0027re all the same stamp of bastard.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We are good soldiers,\u0027 shouted Svejk. \u0027We are the troglodytes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellors took off his camouflage cloak and draped it over one of the coffins. The long box was fashioned from ammunition cases broken apart and nailed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You are not our enemy, Winthrop,\u0027 Mellors said kindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m glad to hear it. Now, if we could be on our way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You are a living man and you can do us no harm. Only the dead hands of the old men hurt us. The century-befuddled fools with their tides and honours and bloodlines and lineage, they are the monsters who have reduced us to what you see.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall\u0027s eyes swivelled. He was bound too, hoisted up by a couple of the troglodytes. There were iron hooks set into the concrete wall, high up and painted to fit in with the savage mural. Ball hung from the hook, shoulder-joints creaking, arms forced behind him. He hissed through lengthening teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This man has suffered,\u0027 Mellors said. \u0027That\u0027s obvious. Why should he suffer? What is it to him which weak-blooded parasite holds sway over the muddy stretch of countryside up above?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall howled like a rage-maddened animal, showing the proper school spirit. He snarled abuse at his captors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop\u0027s wrists were yanked upwards. Barbs tore flesh. Pain burned in his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No sir, you are not our enemy, but you might be our salvation. As you see, we are sadly short on provisions.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvejk\u0027s head expanded inside his mask. His eyes grew to fill the holes, wolfish hair swarming around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop was lifted by troglodytes. His wrists scraped as they were forced up over the hook. His heels scrabbled at the wall as his captors let him go. His weight dragged him down, but his feet did not reach the floor. A belt of agony fell across his shoulders and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the troglodytes, a kilted Scot, sniffed his swollen knee. He pulled off the boot and rent apart Winthrop\u0027s layers of clothes, then ran a long, sandpapery tongue over the wound. Winthrop fought to keep his stomach down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellors reached up and pinched his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You might last for weeks,\u0027 he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-22.html","bookId":1619,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM"}
