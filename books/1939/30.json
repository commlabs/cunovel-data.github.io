On a table in the small dining nook lay a hardcover book, opened and turned over to mark her place. I cringe whenever I see a book bent in such a fashion. I was sorely tempted to reach down and close it. This was a personal peeve of mine. I could see no reason to break a book\u0027s spine when a bookmark would serve just as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking out the window, Macy announced, \"Harvey\u0027s out back, sitting in his chair. He spends far too much time doing that. He never used to.\" Worry tinged her voice. \"I have a feeling he\u0027s had another bad day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now I wasn\u0027t sure what she expected me to do. I\u0027d talk to Harvey and determine what I could, but I had no promises to give her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the back door. \"Let me introduce you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, only--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t allowed to finish before she half dragged me outside. \"Harvey,\" she called. \"I\u0027d like you to meet Michael, the man I was telling you about.\" Then she turned to me and whispered, \"This is just for show.\" With that, she looped her arms around my neck and kissed my cheek. Turning back to Harvey, she said, \"You were right all along. I was besotted from the moment we met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesotted? Who used a word like besotted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey regarded me for a minute or so before he revealed any expression. It could have been a smile or a scowl, but frankly it was hard to distinguish which. \"I can only imagine what she did to con you into coming by,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re better off not knowing,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a snort of laughter, then gestured toward the house. \"There\u0027s another chair over there. Help yourself.\" He looked at Macy next. \"I\u0027ve got a couple of beers in the fridge. Why don\u0027t you get them for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed more than eager to comply, even though he hadn\u0027t offered her one. \"Coming right up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both climbed over the low fence, and Sammy jumped after us. She bounced into the house with the mutt close on her heels. The three cats had decided to stay at her place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carried the folding lawn chair next to Harvey and sat down. Macy was back with the two beers, which she handed us. Then she disappeared again, leaping over the fence as if she\u0027d done it a thousand times, which undoubtedly she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re that doctor fellow she\u0027s been talking about,\" Harvey said. He took a swallow of beer and closed his eyes, either to savor the taste or allow a moment of pain to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a sip of my own beer and had to admit it hit the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you start asking a lot of discreet questions, I should tell you I\u0027m not going to make an appointment with any friends of yours. Nor am I willing to undergo any medical tests. I know what\u0027s wrong with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a relief. \"So tell me and save me the bother of answering Macy\u0027s questions later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m dying,\" the old man said matter-of-factly. \"It doesn\u0027t get much simpler than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what?\" I asked. Given his age, that seemed possible, and if he wasn\u0027t willing to have any tests or submit to a physical, I had no choice but to accept his self-diagnosis-- at least until I saw firm evidence to the contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say for sure. Cancer maybe, but it could be my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are your symptoms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different ones. I get weak when I didn\u0027t used to. At first I thought it was my age, but now I know it\u0027s more than that. Used to be I could work in my yard all day and not get tired. Lately it\u0027s all I can do to water the garden. I have pains in my chest. No fever, though, which means it\u0027s not malaria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suggest--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case you didn\u0027t understand me before, I\u0027ll repeat myself. I\u0027m not interested in anything you have to suggest that will lengthen my life. I\u0027ve lived a lot of years. Like everyone else, I have a few regrets, but I\u0027m ready to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time Macy learned she needs to let go of me.\" \"She loves you,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey exhaled loudly as though burdened by her love. \"She loves those cats of hers, too. Never met anyone quite like her. She collects animals and people the way someone else might collect baseball cards or ceramic frogs. I tried to discourage her when she moved in after her grandmother died. I think Lotty must\u0027ve asked her to keep an eye on me. That would be just like the old bat. The last thing I need is Macy constantly fussing over me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man eyed me closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re married?\" Harvey interrupted. His gaze narrowed menacingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was. I\u0027m a widower,\" I corrected. \"Hannah, in the end, didn\u0027t want any more medical intervention. No heroic measures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember--\" he nodded in the direction of Macy\u0027s house \"--she told me about your wife. I\u0027m sorry for your loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I murmured. \"I just wanted to let you know I understand how you feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a matter of dignity. I prefer to face death on my own terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered those had been Hannah\u0027s words, too. \"Is there anything I can do to help with the pain?\" I asked. The current drugs would ease his final months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey shook his head. \"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy reappeared, carrying a platter with cheese and crackers. I watched as she popped a cracker in her mouth. \"I brought you a few munchies,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\" Harvey demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might be hungry,\" she said, smiling down at him, obviously accustomed to his gruff manner. She sat on the grass beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey might not be, but I was. I reached for a slice of cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t eat that one if I were you,\" Macy said in a muted voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Snowball licked it before I had a chance to shoo him away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snowball is a he?\" I probably should\u0027ve asked why she hadn\u0027t just removed that piece of cheese from the plate. Instead, I was struck by the fact that the white puffball was male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy stretched out her legs and leaned back on her hands. \"He\u0027s never forgiven me for naming him that, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then change his name.\" The solution seemed simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t. I tried, but I see him as Snowball, and nothing else seems to suit him now. Besides, all his medical records are in that name. It\u0027s too confusing to make the switch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey sighed. \"Just accept what she says without asking a lot of questions. It\u0027s easier that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see his point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy joined the conversation, telling us about the mural and the patients she\u0027d seen coming in and out during the day. Sammy lay next to her, as close as he could get without sitting right on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt soon became apparent that Harvey had tired himself out and needed to go inside. I started to help him up, which he didn\u0027t appreciate, slapping my hand away. \"Leave me alone,\" he snapped, \"and allow an old man his pride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy stood beside me and watched as her friend and neighbor walked slowly toward his house. The instant he was out of earshot, she bombarded me with questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" she asked, sounding nearly breathless. \"Can you tell what\u0027s making him so weak? He\u0027s sick, isn\u0027t he? I mean, really sick? Were you able to convince him to make a doctor\u0027s appointment? You led into that subtly, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go inside and talk,\" I said, dreading this conversation. I hadn\u0027t been eager to meet Harvey, but to my surprise I liked the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her lead, climbing over the low fence, Sammy by our side, accompanying us every step of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bad, isn\u0027t it? You don\u0027t need to mince words with me. I just want the truth. Don\u0027t be afraid to tell me.\" She was walking backward as we crossed her yard. We entered her small house through the back porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured to a chair in the breakfast nook and, once she\u0027d sat down, I pulled out the adjacent chair, turning so that I faced her directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at me. \"He\u0027s dying, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded rather than speak the words aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to do something,\" she insisted, half rising out of her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gently placed my hands on her shoulders and pushed her down. \"Macy, he knows he\u0027s dying and it\u0027s all right with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t with me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harvey\u0027s ready to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might be, but I\u0027m not ready to lose him.\" Big tears welled up in her eyes, threatening to spill over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not really up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the end of her life, Hannah refused further chemotherapy,\" I told her, my voice low and to my embarrassment riddled with remembered pain. \"She knew it was useless and asked me to let her die. I wanted to keep her with me as long as I could, but that would\u0027ve been selfish. I had to accede to her wishes. Harvey is asking the same of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy sniffled and the cats gathered around her feet as if to offer comfort. Sammy stood guard and eyed me, his message clear--if I made one wrong move I\u0027d pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said and instinctively put my arms around her. Then for reasons I may never understand, I bent down, moving my head toward hers, and sought out her lips. We kissed. This wasn\u0027t a peck on the cheek or the friendly kiss I\u0027d exchanged with Winter and Leanne. This was a Kiss with a capital K, a real kiss that shocked me to the very marrow of my bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe broke apart as if we\u0027d suddenly realized what we were doing. Macy looked, if anything, even more unsettled than I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" She couldn\u0027t possibly be thanking me for the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For spending time with Harvey and for telling me about Hannah\u0027s request.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said, striving for levity. \"Happy to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left shortly afterward, confused about what had made me kiss Macy and, more importantly, why I\u0027d enjoyed it so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t sleep well that night. I wasn\u0027t surprised when Macy didn\u0027t show up on Thursday. By her own admission she wasn\u0027t good at completing projects. But this mysterious absence was due to more than that. I knew it in my gut, the same way I knew the kiss we shared was special. \"Have you heard from Macy today?\" I asked Linda. I didn\u0027t want to say too much but I was curious. She might have called with a plausible excuse that Linda hadn\u0027t bothered to pass on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You mean you haven\u0027t, either?\" Linda\u0027s eyes narrowed slightly. \"You didn\u0027t say anything to upset her, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" I asked. I shot Linda a hard look, but not because I was angry. I might be her employer, but every so often she slipped into the role of substitute mother. I was astonished at how willing Linda was to come to Macy\u0027s defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to minimize my interest by saying in a calmer voice, \"I\u0027m sure Macy will be in later this afternoon. If not, she\u0027ll be here tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she will,\" Linda said, then added, \"We just love her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked to my trusted nurse for an explanation. I didn\u0027t quite understand how this had happened. Had they all fallen for Macy? In less than two weeks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda\u0027s mouth quirked with the beginnings of a smile. \"Well, first, I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve noticed, but she chats with all the children before and after their visits.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-30.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
