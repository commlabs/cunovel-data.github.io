Ten years, he thought. And all kinds of weird\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estuff with winged wossnames and sea-monsters. On the other hand, would it do him any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood to know? “You get home okay,” he said. “You\u0027re well known for it, in fact. There\u0027s whole legends about you going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Phew.” Lavaeolus leaned against a hull, took off his helmet and wiped his forehead. “That\u0027s a load off my mind, I\u0027ll tell you. I was afraid the gods might have a grudge against me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind said nothing. “They get a bit angry if you go around thinking up ideas like wooden horses and tunnels,” said Lavaeolus. \"they\u0027re traditionalists, you know. They prefer people just to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehack at one another. I thought, you see, that if I could show people how to get what they wanted more easily they\u0027d stop being so bloody stupid.“ From further along the shoreline came the sound of male voices raised in song: ” - vestal virgins, Came down from Heliodeliphilodelphiboschromenos, And when the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eball was over, There were - “ ”It never works,\" said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s got to be worth a try, though. Hasn\u0027t it?” “Oh, yes.” Lavaeolus slapped him on the back. “Cheer up,” he said. “Things can only get better.” They walked out into the dark breakers where Lavaeolus\u0027 ship was riding at anchor, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind watched him swim out and climb aboard. After a while the oars were shipped, or unshipped, or whatever they called it when they were stuck through the holes in the sides, and the boat moved slowly out into the bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few voices floated back over the surf. “Point the pointed end that way, sergeant.” “Aye, aye, sir!” \"And don\u0027t shout. Did I tell you to shout? Why do you all have to shout? Now I\u0027m going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edownstairs for a lie down.“ Rincewind trudged back up the beach. ”The trouble is,“ he said, ”is that things never get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetter, they just say the same, only more so. But he\u0027s going to have enough to worry about.“ Behind him, Eric blew his nose. ”That was the saddest thing I\u0027ve ever heard,\" he said. From further along the beach the Ephebian and Tsortean armies were still in full voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound their convivial campfires. “ - the village harpy she was there - ” “Come on,” said Rincewind. “Let\u0027s go home.” “You know the funny thing about his name?” said Eric, as they strolled along the sand. “No. what do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lavaeolus means `Rinser of winds`.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind looked at him. “He\u0027s my ancestor?” he said. “Who knows?” said Eric. “Oh. Gosh.” Rincewind thought about this. \"Well, I whish I\u0027d told him to avoid getting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emarried. Or visiting Ankh-Morpork.“ ”It probably isn\u0027t even built yet...\" Rincewind tried snapping his fingers. This time it worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstfgl sat back. He wondered what did happen to Lavaeolus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods and demons, being creatures outside of time, don\u0027t move in it like bubbles in the stream. Everything happens at the same time for them. This should mean they know everything that is going to happen because, in a sense, it already has. The reason they don\u0027t is that reality is a big place with a lot of interesting things going on, and keeping track of all of them is like trying to use a very big video recorder with no freeze button or tape counter. It\u0027s usually easier just to wait and see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day he\u0027d have to go and look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight here and now, insofar as the words can be employed about an outside of space and time, matters were not progressing well. Eric seemed marginally more likeable, which wasn\u0027t acceptable. He also appeared to have changed the course of history, although this is impossible since the only thing you can do to the course of history is facilitate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was needed was something climactic. Something really soul-destroying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon King realised he was twirling his moustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble with snapping your fingers is that you never knew what it would lead to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything around Rincewind was black. It wasn\u0027t simply an absence of colour. It was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarkness that flatly denied any possibility that colour might ever have existed. His feet weren\u0027t touching anything, and he appeared to be floating. There was something else missing. He couldn\u0027t quite put his finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you there, Eric?” he ventured. A clear voice nearby said: “Yes. Are you there, demon?” “Ye-ess.” “Where are we? Are we falling?” “I don\u0027t think so,” said Rincewind, speaking from experience. \"There\u0027s no rushing wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou get a rushing wind when you\u0027re falling. Also your past life flashes before your eyes, and I haven\u0027t seen anything I recognise yet.“ ”Rincewind?“ ”Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I open my mouth no sounds come out.” “Don\u0027t be - ” Rincewind hesitated. He wasn\u0027t making any sound either. He knew what he was saying, it just wasn\u0027t reaching the outside world. But he could hear Eric. Perhaps the words just gave up on his ears and went straight to his brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s probably some kind of magic, or something,” he said. “There\u0027s no air. That\u0027s why there no sound. All the little bits of air sort of knock together, like marbles. That\u0027s how you get sound, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it? Gosh.” “So we\u0027re surrounded by absolutely nothing,” said Rincewind. “Total nothing.” He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehesitated. “There\u0027s a word for it,” he said. “It\u0027s what you get when there\u0027s nothing left and everything\u0027s been used up.” “Yes. I think it\u0027s called the bill,” said Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind gave this some thought. It sounded about right. “Okay,” he said. “The bill. That\u0027s where we are. Floating in absolute bill. Total, complete, rock-hard bill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstfgl was going frantic now. He had spells that could find anyone anywhere, anywhen, and they weren\u0027t anywhere. One minute he was watching them on the beach, the next... nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left only two other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately he chose the wrong one first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even some stars would be nice,” said Eric. “There\u0027s something very odd about all this,” said Rincewind. “I mean, do you feel cold?” “No.” “Well do you feel warm?” “No. I don\u0027t feel anything much, really.” “No hot, no cold, no light, no heat, no air,” said Rincewind. \"Just bill. How long have we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen here?“ ”Don\u0027t know. Seems like ages, but...“ ”Aha. I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s any time, either. Not what you\u0027d call proper time. Just the kind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof time people make up as they go along.“ ”Well, I didn\u0027t expect to see anybody else here,\" said a voice by Rincewind\u0027s ear. It was a slightly put-upon voice, a voice made for complaining in, but at least there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno hint of menace. Rincewind let himself float around. A little rat-faced man was sitting cross-legged, watching him with vague suspicion. He had a pencil behind one ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. Hallo,” said Rincewind. “And where is here, exactly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nowhere. S\u0027whole point, innit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nowhere at all?” “Not yet.” “All right,” said Eric. “When is it going to be somewhere?” “Hard to say,” said the little man. \"Looking at the pair of you, and taking one thing with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother, metabolic rates and that, I\u0027d say that this place is due to become somewhere in, well, give or take a bit, in about five hundred seconds. “He began to unwrap the pack in his lap. ”Fancy a sandwich while we\u0027re waiting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Would I - ” At this point Rincewind\u0027s stomach, aware that if his brain was allowed to make the running it was in danger of losing the initiative, cut in and prompted him to say, “What sort?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Search me. What sort would you like it to be?” “Sorry?” “Don\u0027t mess about. Just say what sort you\u0027d like it to be.” “Oh?” Rincewind stared at him. “Well, if you\u0027ve got egg and cress -” “Let there be egg and cress, sort of thing,” said the little man. He reached into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epackage, and proffered a white triangle to Rincewind. “Gosh,” said Rincewind. “What a coincidence.” “It should be starting any minute now,” said the little man. \"Over - not that they\u0027ve got\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany proper directions sorted out yet, of course, not them - there.“ ”All I can see is darkness,“ said Eric. ”No you can\u0027t,“ said the little man, triumphantly. ”You\u0027re just seeing what there is before\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe darkness has been installed, sort of thing.“ He gave the not-yet-darkness a dirty look. ”Come on,“ he said. ”Why are we waiting, why-eye are we waiting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Waiting for what?” said Rincewind. “Everything.” “Everything what?” said Rincewind. “Everything. Not everything what. Everything, sort of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstfgl peered through the swirling gas clouds. At least he was in the right place. The whole point about the end of the universe was that you couldn\u0027t go past it accidentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last few embers winked out. Time and space collided silently, and collapsed. Astfgl coughed. It can get so very lonely, when you\u0027re twenty million light years from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone there?” he said. YES. The voice was right by his ear. Even demon kings can shiver. “Apart from you, I mean,” he said. “Have you seen anybody?” YES. “Who?” EVERYONE. Astfgl sighed. “I mean anyone recently.” IT\u0027S BEEN VERY QUIET, said Death. “Damn.” WERE YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought there might be someone called Rincewind, but -” Astfgl began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath\u0027s eyesockets flared red. THE WIZARD? he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, he\u0027s a dem -” Astfgl stopped. For what would have been several seconds, had time still existed, he floated in a state of horrible suspicion. “A human?” he growled. IT IS STRETCHING THE TERM A LITTLE, BUT YOU ARE BROADLY CORRECT. “Well I\u0027ll be damned!” Astfgl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI BELIEVE YOU ALREADY ARE. The Demon King extended a shaking hand. His mounting fury was over-ridding his sense of style; his red silk gloves ripped as the talons unfolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, because it\u0027s never a good idea to get on the wrong side of anyone with a scythe, Astfgl said, “Sorry you\u0027ve been troubled,” and vanished. Only when he judged himself out of Death\u0027s extremely acute hearing did he scream his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothingness uncoiled its interminable length through the draughty spaces at the end of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etime. Death waited. After a while his skeletal fingers began to drum on the handle of his scythe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness lapped around him. There wasn\u0027t even any infinity any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe attempted to whistle a few snatches of unpopular songs between his teeth, but the sound was simply sucked into nothingness. Forever was over. All the sands had fallen. The great race between entropy and energy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad been run, and the favourite had been the winner after all. Perhaps he ought to sharpen the blade again? No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much point, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat roils of absolutely nothing stretched into what would have been called the distance, if there had been a space-time reference frame to give words like “distance” any sensible meaning any more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-12.html","bookId":1628,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM"}
